A group of four U.S. accountants has been asked to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> this week by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Commerce Department</ENAMEX> to check on the status of the Polish accounting profession.
With a proposal in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to give <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> anywhere from $100 million to $150 million, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> wants to find out more about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s accounting methods.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> hasn't any national accounting standards. ``Also, we're really not sure where the Polish accounting profession stands because we haven't compared it with our own yet,'' she said.
