A bill that would permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> to monitor the financial condition of securities firms' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms, which argue that the legislation is unnecessary.
The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX>, the new chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, hasn't taken a formal position on the bill, which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> additional authority during market emergencies. However, he recently told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers, which are frequently used to issue bridge loans.
The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions. Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans.
But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted. In a July 6 letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, whose holding company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston Group</ENAMEX>, is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>, said it is also concerned that once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> has the power to monitor holding companies, it will try to regulate their activities.
``The proposal, while well-intended, I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken, rather than strengthen the control the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Raoul-Duval</ENAMEX>, managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, said in an interview.
The bill would ``divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raoul-Duval</ENAMEX> said.
Sources in the industry and on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s concerns may be possible. An aide to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Securities Subcommittee</ENAMEX> says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure, but adds: ``nobody is wedded to the language in the bill.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward O'Brien</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Industry Association</ENAMEX>, said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is ``hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s goals.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> will elaborate on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIA</ENAMEX>'s position in testimony before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ENAMEX> this week, a spokesman said.
