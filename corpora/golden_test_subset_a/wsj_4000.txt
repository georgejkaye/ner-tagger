A group including Malcolm I. Glazer, a Rochester, N.Y., private investor, said he and members of his family hold a 6.24% stake in Harley-Davidson Inc. and may seek control of the company.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it acquired the stock of the Milwaukee-based motorcyle manufacturer as an investment and currently is evaluating its position with respect to the company.
The group may seek to acquire a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson or seek representation on the company's board. It didn't rule out approaching Harley-Davidson management or board members in connection with its possible plans.
Harley-Davidson officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment yesterday.
According to the filing, the Glazer group holds 539,200 Harley-Davidson common shares, including 187,700 shares bought from Aug. 1 to Sept. 29 for $29.31 to $40.185 a share.
Depending on market conditions and other factors, the group may buy more shares or sell shares in the open market, in private transactions, or ``otherwise,'' the filing said.
As the price range in the filing indicates, the Harley-Davidson's stock has been moving sharply higher in recent weeks. When asked about the jump last week, a Harley official said that the company wasn't aware of any reasons for the stock's strength, saying ``we're trying to figure it out ourselves.'' One rumor that surfaced late last week -- and was quickly squelched by Harley -- was that Ford Motor Co. was interested in buying the company.
News of the Glazer group's filing wasn't disclosed until after the close of the market yesterday.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harley shares slipped 50 cents to close at $39 1/8. Since mid-September, however, it has surged from $32 a share to trade as high as $40 5/8.
