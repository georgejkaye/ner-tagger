<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Boesky</ENAMEX> may have settled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government for $100 million, but the government is receiving nearly $5 million less.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> Friday agreed to sell the government's 23% holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrian & General Securities PLC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucadia National Corp.</ENAMEX> for a total of about $38.3 million. The shares were acquired from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> in 1986 as part of his settlement on insider-trading charges. At the time, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> also paid $50 million in cash and relinquished his holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northview Corp.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> had valued the total package at $100 million, half of which would be returned to investors through a restitution fund. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northview</ENAMEX> went private, buying back the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s holding for $4.3 million. The government also has received about $2.5 million in dividends from the holdings, making the total the government received from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> $95.1 million.
Becoming a shareholder put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> in an awkward position. The commission became an interested party in the stock, in addition to its traditional role as regulator. It appointed two members to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrian</ENAMEX>'s five-member board.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> announced in August 1987 -- five days before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average peaked for the year -- that it wouldn't liquidate its holdings. Investigations into Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX>'s actions were continuing, the agency said, and selling the stock would force the commission to disclose information about those probes. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> would be forced to release information that could have a material effect on the shares of the two companies.
In a statement at the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX> said, ``The government, not investors, will bear any valuation risks that may exist'' by holding the stock. Such risks became evident two months later, when the stock market crash hammered the shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrian</ENAMEX>, a British investment trust. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, along with other stock-market investors, saw the value of its holdings plummet, despite a gain in the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northview</ENAMEX> shares that day. ``The market break had a severe impact on {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrian</ENAMEX>'','' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Mann</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s associate director for international affairs. ``It had been an aggressive investment vehicle.''
Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucadia</ENAMEX> launched a tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrian</ENAMEX>, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> again refused to sell its holding.
But on Friday, the agency relented, selling the shares to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucadia</ENAMEX>, which already held about three-quarters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrian</ENAMEX> shares outstanding. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boesky</ENAMEX> investigation has been concluded, and the agency said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucadia</ENAMEX>, as the major shareholder, fully understands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrian</ENAMEX> holding.
