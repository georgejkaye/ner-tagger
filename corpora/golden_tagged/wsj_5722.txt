A federal judge ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> to investigate whether the government has leaked confidential information to the press about its case against indicted financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX>.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimba Wood</ENAMEX> said she wouldn't hold a hearing on the leak allegations made by defense lawyers until after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>'s trial, so as not to heighten publicity in the racketeering and fraud case.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>'s lawyers last week asked Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX> to order the government to halt a ``constant stream'' of press leaks they claimed threatened the right to a fair trial for the former head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>'s junk-bond division. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX> is presiding over the case.
``We're very pleased with the court's decision to direct an investigation into the alleged leaks,'' Milken attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Flumenbaum</ENAMEX> said.
The defense motion cited stories published in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> Post and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> Times.
