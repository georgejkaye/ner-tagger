The chairman and four other top officers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX>, resigned abruptly in a management shakeout that places the airline's new owner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Checchi</ENAMEX>, at its helm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven G. Rothmeier</ENAMEX>, whose iron-willed approach to running <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> triggered controversy during much of his three-year term as chairman, submitted his resignation at a meeting late Wednesday with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX>, who will succeed him. His decision to quit prompted four other executives to depart as well, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Horn</ENAMEX>, president and chief operating officer.
The moves come only three months after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Paul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minn.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> ended a takeover siege by agreeing to a $3.65 billion offer from a group led by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investor. One of that group's principal investors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic Malek</ENAMEX>, yesterday was named president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX>.
The moves are likely to have a significant influence on the nation's fourth-largest carrier. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX>'s tough style helped make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> an aggressive competitor, but it also created tensions among employees that contributed to service problems. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX>'s goals include raising morale at the airline and improving customer service.
People familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> said that there have been indications over the past several weeks that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with management at the airline. Among other things, there were rumblings that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> considered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX>'s management style too autocratic.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> wants to change the direction of the company and obviously wants to run it himself,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Kutzke</ENAMEX>, a former vice president, airline planning, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX> and the other departing executives couldn't be reached for comment.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> spokesman denied there is any animosity between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX>. ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> wanted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX> to stay on,'' he said. ``It was strictly Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX>'s decision.'' At one point during the takeover battle, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX> characterized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Checchi</ENAMEX> group as ``totally friendly.'' In fact, some people involved in the takeover battle said that characterization may have helped Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> gain the financial backing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX>, which was crucial to his winning the bidding battle. At the time, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> said he didn't plan a management shakeout at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>.
Nevertheless, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> executive said that immediately after the buy-out was first approved, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX> indicated that he and several of his officers were considering leaving the airline.
The other officers who resigned are: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Pray</ENAMEX>, executive vice president-international; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin G. Griggs Jr.</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Cos.</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sitter</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of administration and chief information officer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Cos.</ENAMEX> is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Cronin</ENAMEX>, former president and chief executive officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger International</ENAMEX>, was named executive vice president and chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Cos.</ENAMEX> He is a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfred Checchi Associates</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investment firm of which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> is president.
One thing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> has in common with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX>, who rose through the finance department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX>, is a strong aptitude for working with numbers.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX>, 41 years old, spent much of his career arranging financing for hotels as treasurer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott Corp.</ENAMEX> and as an adviser to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bass Brothers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malek</ENAMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> president, was president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> much of the time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> worked there. Working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bass Brothers</ENAMEX> for tiny percentages of the profits on multi-billion-dollar deals, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> amassed personal wealth of more than $50 million.
He also is known for having a sometimes abrasive personality.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX>'s own hard-line approach became obvious when he oversaw the 1986 acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic Airlines</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX>. The executive was one of the first in the airline business to predict a significant consolidation of the industry. Moving to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> would be one of the surviving carriers, he added more planes, built up hubs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX> and negotiated the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>.
The speed with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>, however, caused problems. The combined carrier had difficulty blending its route systems and employee groups. The results included flight delays and passenger complaints. At one point, the carrier even lost track of one of its own jets.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rothmeier</ENAMEX> became a lightning rod for criticism -- and a disgruntled employee group once held a candlelight vigil outside his castle-like home.
Nevertheless, he was admired by many of his immediate subordinates for his long work hours and dedication to building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> into what he called a ``mega carrier.
