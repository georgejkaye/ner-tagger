<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> reported third-quarter net income rose 27%, bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX> said net income for the quarter rose to $76.7 million, or $1.06 a share, on sales that increased 6% to $1.3 billion. In the year-earlier period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> posted net income of $60.2 million, or 88 cents a share. Last year's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $13.1 million, or 19 cents a share.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuben Mark</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX>, said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Results were also bolstered by ``a very meaningful increase in operating profit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX>'s U.S. business,'' he said.
Operating profit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX>'s U.S. household products and personal care businesses, which include such well-known brands as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate toothpaste</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fab</ENAMEX> laundry detergent, jumped more than 40%, the company said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations, blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company's promotional activities.
``We've done a lot to improve (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>) results and a lot more will be done,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark</ENAMEX> said. ``Improving profitability of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations is an extremely high priority in the company.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX>'s results were at the high end of the range of analysts' forecasts. The scope of the improvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> business caught some analysts by surprise. The company's domestic business, especially its household products division, has performed poorly for years. Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales.
For the nine months, net increased 14% to $217.5 million, or $3.09 a share. Sales rose 7% to $3.8 billion. The company earned $191.1 million, or $2.79 a share, in the year-earlier period. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX>'s 1988 net income included $40.1 million, or 59 cents a share, from discontinued operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> Wednesday finalized an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macrochem Corp.</ENAMEX>, a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Billerica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, to market in the U.S. four of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macrochem</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>-approved dental products. The products -- sealants and bonding materials used by dentists -- all contain fluoride that is released over time. The move is part of a drive to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX>'s business with dentists, a company spokeswoman said. Terms of the agreement weren't given.
