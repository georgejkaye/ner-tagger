<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conagra Inc.</ENAMEX> said it will realign its processed-meats operations, and took a $24.8 million after-tax provision against earnings to cover anticipated costs.
But while saying that a number of its operating companies would be affected, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Neb.</ENAMEX>, company wouldn't give details. ``It's simply premature to do that,'' a spokesman said, indicating that the restructuring would occur in steps.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conagra</ENAMEX>'s processed-meats operation includes its Armour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food Co.</ENAMEX> unit, which already has undergone a restructuring.
To cover the expected costs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conagra</ENAMEX> wrote down plant, property and equipment assets and took an additional charge for plant consolidations in the first quarter ended Aug. 27. Those provisions were more than offset by a $26.9 million gain from settling litigation related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conagra</ENAMEX>'s failed effort to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holly Farms Corp.</ENAMEX>
For the quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conagra</ENAMEX> reported net income of $49.9 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $38.1 million, or 48 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose 43% to $4 billion, from $2.8 billion, mainly reflecting the consolidation of Swift Independence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packing Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conagra</ENAMEX> bought the remaining 50% of that business in the quarter.
