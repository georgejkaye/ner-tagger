As recently as April, the year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton Hotel</ENAMEX> in the scenic Chinese city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guilin</ENAMEX> enjoyed a 90% occupancy rate. Today, the luxury establishment is nearly deserted; business is so dismal that the foreign investor in the hotel project, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Hsieh</ENAMEX>, is prepared to give away his 50% share to his partner, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guilin</ENAMEX> government.
The hotel hasn't defaulted on its debt, though its most recent loan payment was late. And it isn't clear how it is going to finance its next payment, due in two months.
The hotel's reversal stems from the massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> on June 4. In the wake of the shootings, tourism to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> dried up and foreign trade faltered. Even before June 4, investors in hotel and office projects faced cost overruns and late loan payments because of a glut of projects. The shootings simply magnified the problems.
Foreign bankers say almost every new Chinese hotel and office tower faces problems meeting loan-repayment schedules. Though analysts say the hotel business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is slowly improving, 1989 occupancy rates are expected to average only 50%, down from estimates of between 70% and 80% before the massacre. Currently, occupancy rates average 30% to 40%.
While bankers have been  relatively patient in addressing the loan problems, more of them are becoming hard-nosed because of a growing nervousness about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s ability to repay its debts, especially those guaranteed by provincial governments. Some foreign banks are even considering taking loan-defaulters to court, a drastic step in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> because court action is viewed as harmful to a foreign bank's long-term interests in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. Since June 4, there has been almost no new lending to the country.
Foreign bank loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s hotel and property sector are estimated at between $6 billion and $8 billion, or 15% to 20% of the estimated $42 billion in total lending to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. ``Everybody in the hotel market probably shares the same view that in the coming years China will face a very difficult time in servicing its debt,'' says a Japanese banker based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is the most exposed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> government and Japanese commercial banks have made loans totaling $20 billion to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. Among the most prominent credits is a $135 million syndicated loan, mostly from Japanese banks, for the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Exhibition</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Complex</ENAMEX>, which is near completion. The project's creditors already are working to reschedule the loan, and its Chinese and foreign equity partners agreed last month to inject $20 million in fresh capital.
In another instance, the Chinese and foreign equity partners of the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China World Trade Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> provided an additional $50 million last month to keep that project going.
While most foreign banks are gambling that tourism will pick up and are working to reschedule their loans, some bankers are hardening their approach.
``Relationships have taken a back seat now, and bankers have probably realized that they would face a lot of loan defaults in the coming years,'' says a banker in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. ``It's better to act tough and try to collect as much money as possible before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> runs out of money.
