Is an American Secretary of State seriously suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> should help govern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>? Apparently so. There are no easy choices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>, but we can't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>.
Now that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> appears to have pulled out its occupation army, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> is talking again about accepting an ``interim'' coalition government in the Cambodian capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phnom Penh</ENAMEX>. The coalition would include the current Vietnamese-backed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun Sen</ENAMEX> regime, the two non-communist resistance groups led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Son Sann</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Sihanouk</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX>. The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX> by allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> a small share of power. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> says that any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> participation would have to be ``minimal.''
The usual problem with including communists in ``interim'' coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else. Recall that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Somoza</ENAMEX> moderates. Within two years, the moderates were exiled or in prison, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> had gone communist, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> were building one of the biggest armies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> and threatening their neighbors. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Laos</ENAMEX>, when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao Tse</ENAMEX>-tung's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller, non-communist parties.
What complicates the scene in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX> is that the current regime is already communist, as are its Vietnamese overseers back in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hanoi</ENAMEX>, as are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups. It's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government, but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear. That would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun Sen</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun Sen</ENAMEX> regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>'s equivalent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> Wall near the Thai border. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX>, however, carry an unsurpassed record for Cambodian tyranny. These utopians caused the deaths -- by starvation, disease or execution -- of well over one million Cambodians. The Cambodian horror was so bad that the Vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief.
The world might want to believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> can't still be such bad guys, just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of genocide then taking place. But there is no solid evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> have changed. Some of our sources in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX> say the notorious old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> leader, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pol Pot</ENAMEX>, has been holed up this summer in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> camps near the Thai-Cambodian border.
So it's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> is willing to accept conditions that would help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> set up shop again in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phnom Penh</ENAMEX>. True, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Sihanouk</ENAMEX> backs the idea of such a coalition, at least for this week. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Sihanouk</ENAMEX> has backed all sorts of ideas over the years, and done rather better by himself than by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>. Nor should the U.S. worry much about offending <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, which still aids the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX>. It's time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> recognized that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> does not play by gentlemen's rules.
For the U.S. to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indochina</ENAMEX>'s bleak scene could only disturb <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s allies elsewhere. It would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX> to conclude the following: Fight viciously enough and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, under the banner of pragmatism, might eventually help negotiate your way to victory. U.S. diplomacy has done it before, and it will likely do it again.
The administration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>'s non-communists. But now the possibility of ``diplomatic movement'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>'s withdrawal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> initiative) has put that plan on hold, with the proviso that if the going got rough, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would then rearm the opposition. Why the timidity? At the very least, the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khmer Rouge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>'s communists from ultimately moving against their opponents. When that day comes, it would be particularly awful to know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor.
