The drug RU-486, which is vigorously opposed by right-to-life groups as an ``abortion pill,'' has been found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern California</ENAMEX> researchers to be effective in treating certain types of brain and spinal tumors.
The preliminary findings, presented yesterday by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based researchers at a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Academy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Neurological Surgeons</ENAMEX>, show that the controversial drug may have medical applications in treating a benign tumor that accounts for about 18% of all brain tumors.
RU-486 is currently used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, and has been used in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. But in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, any possible interest in marketing the drug has been dashed by right-to-life groups that have made it clear they would lead a boycott of any company that tried to market the drug. RU-486 can be used as an abortifacient in the early stages of pregnancy; about 250 women a day take it in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, where it accounts for one out of every four legal abortions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX> tests, however, are now looking at other medical applications, including treatment of breast cancer, pituitary-gland disorders and endometriosis, a disorder of the uterus that is the third-leading cause of female infertility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
``I hope the controversy around RU-486 doesn't prevent the use of this drug for other purposes,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Grunberg</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">USC</ENAMEX> associate professor of medicine and oncologist who led the brain and tumor study.
Earlier this week, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etienne-Emile Baulieu</ENAMEX>, the French creator of the abortion pill, won the prestigious 1989 Albert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lasker Medical Research Award</ENAMEX> for his research on the role of steroid hormones in brain and sexual functions.
The two-year USC study showed shrinkage of meningioma, a tumor of the brain and spinal cord, in four of 14 patients. Some of these tumors occur in the base of the brain and are not accessible by surgery, so RU-486 could be used as an alternative to radiation treatment, the study found. Such tumors, which occur more often in women than men, can cause blindness, headaches, muscle weakness, paralysis, confusion and seizures.
``Obviously, as time goes on, other uses for this drug will be found,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeannie Rosoff</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alan Guttmacher Institute</ENAMEX>, a research group that focuses on fertility and family-planning issues.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Glasow</ENAMEX>, education director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Right</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Committee</ENAMEX>, a leading anti-abortion group, said that studies on other medical uses for RU-486 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> have been largely inconclusive. The drug ``is now being marketed to kill unborn babies,'' he said. But he added that his group would not oppose controlled marketing of the drug for purposes other than abortion, provided that larger, conclusive studies had been conducted.
