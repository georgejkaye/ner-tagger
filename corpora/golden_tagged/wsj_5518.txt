The director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corcoran</ENAMEX> Gallery of Art has issued an apology to the ``arts community'' for canceling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mapplethorpe</ENAMEX> exhibit. This is the show with photos that are somehow high art but too racy for any media outlet to depict or even describe in words. But if you think that's hot, wait till the fight starts over the Library of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s just-announced list of 25 American films for something called the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Film Registry.</ENAMEX>'' We noticed that ``Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strangelove</ENAMEX>'' made the list but not a single movie about U.S. fighting men in World War II. The battles these arts people start are turning out to be a lot more fun than anything in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
