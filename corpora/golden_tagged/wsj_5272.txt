<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton Opax PLC</ENAMEX>, a British specialty printer, said it decided to recommend that its shareholders accept a # 382 million ($605 million) takeover bid for the company by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowater Industries PLC</ENAMEX>.
The board's decision was widely expected.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowater</ENAMEX>, a British paper and packaging manufacturer that already owns 29% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norton Opax</ENAMEX>, launched its bid Sept. 4, in part to thwart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton Opax</ENAMEX>'s efforts to take over a rival U.K. specialty printer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De La Rue Co</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norton Opax</ENAMEX> dropped its # 688 million hostile bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De La Rue</ENAMEX> last Thursday when it became apparent that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowater</ENAMEX> and its other shareholders would vote against the move at a forthcoming general meeting.
