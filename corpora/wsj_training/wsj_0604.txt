<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> is trying to struggle back.
Only a few months ago, the 124-year-old securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown, racked by internal squabbles and defections. Its relationship with parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> had been frayed since a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> insider-trading scandal two years ago. Chief executives and presidents had come and gone.
Now, the firm says it's at a turning point. By the end of this year, 63-year-old Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silas Cathcart</ENAMEX> -- the former chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Tool Works</ENAMEX> who was derided as a ``tool-and-die man'' when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987 -- retires to his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Forest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, home, possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns. ``I've done what I came to do'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>, he says.
And that means 42-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Carpenter</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive since January, will for the first time take complete control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> and try to make good on some grandiose plans. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> says he will return Kidder to prominence as a great investment bank.
Wall Street is understandably skeptical. Through the first nine months of the year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> stocks and bonds, with a 2.8% market share, up slightly from 2.5% in the year-earlier period, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Data Co.</ENAMEX> It's quite a fall from the early 1980s, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary S. Goldstein</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney Group</ENAMEX>, an executive search firm, said: ``I'd like to see (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>) succeed. But they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one.''
In 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> eked out a $46 million profit, mainly because of severe cost cutting. Its 1,400-member brokerage operation reported an estimated $5 million loss last year, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> expects it to turn a profit this year.
In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading; in that controversial business, only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> rivals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>. But even that niche is under attack, as several Wall Street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX>, a former consulting-firm executive who has a love for ``task forces,'' says he has done a ``complete rethink'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> in recent months. There have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm's operations. More than 20 new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since January. The firm's brokerage force has been trimmed and its mergers-and-acquisitions staff increased to a record 55 people.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> says that when he assumes full control, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> will finally tap the resources of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>. One of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s goals when it bought 80% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> in 1986 was to take advantage of ``syngeries'' between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Capital Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s corporate-finance unit, which has $42 billion in assets. The leveraged buy-out group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> Capital now reports to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX>.
So far, instead of teaming up, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> Capital staffers and Kidder investment bankers have bickered. Yet, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX>, ``We've really started to exploit the synergy between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody.</ENAMEX>'' The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year, he says, though not all of them have panned out.
``We've had a good relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>, which is the first time you could say that -- uh, let me withdraw that. It's been a steadily improving relationship,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX>.
Still, without many actual deals to show off, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is left to stress that it finally has ``a team'' in place, and that everyone works harder.
A month ago, the firm started serving dinner at about 7:30 each night; about 50 to 60 of the 350 people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late. ``We are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott C. Newquist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s head of investment banking since June.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Everywhere</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> stresses the ``always working'' theme. A new in-house magazine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder World</ENAMEX> -- which will focus on the firm's synergy strategy, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> -- confides that on weekends Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newquist</ENAMEX> ``often gets value-added ideas while flying his single-engine Cessna <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Centurion</ENAMEX> on the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nantucket.</ENAMEX>''
The firm's new head of mergers and acquisitions under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newquist</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">B.J.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Megargel</ENAMEX>, talks of the opportunity to ``rebuild a franchise'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> name is one of only six or seven that every CEO recognizes as a viable alternative'' when considering a merger deal, he says. Now, according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> World story about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Megargel</ENAMEX>, all the firm has to do is ``position ourselves more in the deal flow.''
With investment banking as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s ``lead business,'' where do Kidder's 42-branch brokerage network and its 1,400 brokers fit in? Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> this month sold off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s eight brokerage offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>, refueling speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is getting out of the brokerage business entirely. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> denies the speculation. To answer the brokerage question, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>, in typical fashion, completed a task-force study. The result: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> will focus on rich individual investors and small companies, much closer to the clientele of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> than a serve-the-world firm like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX> notes that these types of investors also are ``sophisticated'' enough not to complain about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s aggressive use of program trading.
As part of the upscale push, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is putting brokers through a 20-week training course, turning them into ``investment counselors'' with knowledge of corporate finance. They will get ``new and improved tools to sell, particularly to the affluent investor,'' says brokerage chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V. Sheehan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theoretically</ENAMEX>, the brokers will then be able to funnel ``leads'' on corporate finance opportunities to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s investment bankers, possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps. However, skeptics caution that this kind of cross-pollination between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper, but doesn't always happen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> competitors aren't outwardly hostile to the firm, as many are to a tough competitor like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> that doesn't have Kidder's long history. However, competitors say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s hiring binge involving executive-level staffers, some with multiple-year contract guarantees, could backfire unless there are results.
The departing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> says he has no worries about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s future. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX>, who will return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaker Oats Co.</ENAMEX> board of directors, in addition to his personal ventures, is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free-wheeling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>. He also improved the firm's compliance procedures for trading.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> says he has had ``a lot of fun'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>, adding the crack about his being a ``tool-and-die man'' never bothered him. ``It was an absolutely marvelous line and one I used many times,'' he says.
Smiling broadly when he talks about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> says the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> chief is ``going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business.'' In coming years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathcart</ENAMEX> says, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> is ``gon na hum.''
Or, as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carpenter</ENAMEX>, again drawing on his consulting-firm background, puts it: ``We're ready to implement at this point.
