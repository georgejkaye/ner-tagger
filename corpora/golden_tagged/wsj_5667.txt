<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> said it controls 2.3% of the issued share capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> is the consortium that has launched a hostile all-paper # 13.4-billion ($20.97 billion) bid for the diversified British conglomerate. It also announced that it would keep its offer open until Sept. 29.
Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> was given some breathing space when the U.K. Panel on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takeovers and Mergers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> could let its bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> lapse until it had cleared all regulatory hurdles with U.S. insurance commissioners. Should the outcome of legal action in the U.S. prove successful, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> can then launch its offer again within 21 days, the panel ruled.
