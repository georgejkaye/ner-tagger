As the government toughens its stance toward buyers of large, insolvent thrifts, the field of buyers appears to be narrowing to large, well-heeled banks.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX>, the new government agency that will sell the seized thrifts and their assets, is soliciting plain-vanilla, cash-only transactions, at least for the sales of the first 10 big thrifts on the block, which have $20 billion in assets. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX>'s oversight board, which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX>, set policies yesterday that indicate subsequent deals also are likely to be much stingier than past transactions.
Last year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Bank Board</ENAMEX> sold or merged 221 thrifts, in a series of freewheeling transactions with investors ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Perelman</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Bass Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. Investors were drawn by lucrative tax breaks, generous government assistance, and exemptions from meeting certain thrift industry regulations.
In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> is looking for investors to make a capital infusion equal to at least 6% of assets -- much higher than the capital of many of their thrift competitors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> oversight board also decided yesterday to discourage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> from taking equity positions in the thrifts it sells, but said transactions could include the use of stock warrants. Such warrants, which entitle a holder to buy shares at a specified price in the future, would enable the government to benefit from thrift profits but be protected from losses, unlike the loss exposure facing the government for years to come because of the 1988 deals.
Moreover, the oversight board set a policy limiting to six months government guarantees on returns on bad assets.
Without the built-in profits of last year's deals, and with tougher regulations, some industry officials say it will be tough to earn profits, and even tougher to secure the highflying returns that some thrift investment funds are seeking. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Robert</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.E. Robert Co.</ENAMEX>, one of the nation's largest asset-management firms, said that the 20% to 25% return most opportunity investors are seeking will be impossible unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> offers some sort of guaranteed profits on bad assets.
``With respect to the acquisition of stripped-down, clean banks, I'm in a quandary as to how many of the thrift opportunity funds are going to achieve their investors' yield expectations,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard Smith</ENAMEX>, an official of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> fund to buy thrifts, said the fund only recently reached $300 million, but is still far from its initially stated goal of $600 million. The fund, he said, had made significant progress recently, but, ``We are at the minimum level that we said we'd be at.''
The fund is among those likely to sit tight on the initial round of deals, he said, because he doubts whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> will be able to maintain its tough negotiating stance if it can't attract serious bidders. ``I'm a firm believer in market forces,'' he said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> already has quietly told bidders it plans ``clean bank'' transactions with five of the 10 big thrifts on the block now. These thrifts would be stripped of bad assets, to be sold separately to asset-management specialists. They are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Savings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>; Freedom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Financial</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa</ENAMEX>,; Peoples <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Savings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Mesa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif</ENAMEX>.
With the other five big thrifts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> foresees ``whole-bank'' transactions that would require the buyers to take the entire institution, bad assets and all, while receiving one lump-sum payment from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> in return for taking bad loans. They are San <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antonio Savings Association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financial</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>; Broadview <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Savings Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Independence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bright Banc</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skokie Federal S&L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skokie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill</ENAMEX>.
Big banks appear to have deep pockets and could take advantage of the economies of scale to go after the early deals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB National Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, for example, is apparently a strong contender to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Savings of Houston</ENAMEX>, which would be a logical expansion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX>'s growing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Interstate Bancorp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and others remain the most likely buyers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX>'s first 10 big thrifts on the block.
Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> is also, at least initially, following an old policy of banking regulators at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX>, to first consider bids from parties that aren't already receiving government assistance on transactions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX>, for example, already bought out the government stake in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Republic Bank</ENAMEX>, now NCNB <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, in anticipation of doing further government deals.
``That freed us up'' for more bids, a spokesman said. ``We are anxious to benefit from the great earnings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> declined to comment specifically on a bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Savings.</ENAMEX>
