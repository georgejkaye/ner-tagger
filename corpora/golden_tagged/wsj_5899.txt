<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s third-largest defense-electronics company, is mired in a scandal stemming from its 1988 merger with companies controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Guerin</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> arms maker renowned in the defense community for his close ties to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence officials.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> hoped to significantly boost its business with the U.S. military by joining forces with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>. Instead, it is looking into suspected phantom or overstated foreign contracts inherited from one of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s companies. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>, according to analysts and industry officials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, eventually may have to write off $100 million or more of those contracts.
The controversy has raised serious questions about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s management, as well as the nature of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s extensive but little-known dealings with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> and other countries. Over the weekend, news reports in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> even speculated about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s long-term survival if the controversy continues to grow and the suspected contracting irregularities turn out to be more extensive than the company has acknowledged.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> knew that the secretive Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX> had almost single-handedly built a backyard workshop into a $500 million-a-year international defense business. He became deputy chairman of the merged company. What Ferranti apparently didn't know was that some of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s arms transactions already were under criminal investigation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, along with his close association with a now-defunct minority defense contractor.
Barely 15 months after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> completed the $1.54 billion merger, it has become a cautionary tale of the pitfalls of international mergers and acquisitions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s American woes illustrate the special risks of cross-border takeovers of defense concerns, which often have classified contracts and programs otherwise shrouded in secrecy. The lesson comes as defense companies are responding to shrinking military budgets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and elsewhere by seeking to forge international alliances.
``Institutions financing international defense transactions need to be more aware of due diligence issues'' to uncover potential financial sleight of hand, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Bruser</ENAMEX>, an aerospace industry analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Pacific Merchant Bank</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> To unravel the details of military sales, adds Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruser</ENAMEX>, foreign purchasers ``need to make sure they have adequate U.S. representation.''
In this case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s top managers handled the bulk of the ``due diligence'' investigation, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Lupton</ENAMEX>, an official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baring Bros.</ENAMEX>, the British investment bank that worked on the merger for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>, already facing other problems, shocked investors last week by announcing an unusual review to determine the value of certain overseas contracts it inherited from a unit of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal & Control Group PLC</ENAMEX>, which was founded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> but incorporated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. Trading of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> shares was suspended immediately by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
On Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> said it ``suspects significant irregularities'' on several of the contracts, noting that the issues were ``still far from resolved.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> also announced it hired the auditing firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers & Lybrand</ENAMEX> to conduct an urgent investigation. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company wouldn't have any comment, beyond its earlier announcements, until the internal investigation is completed.
Industry officials speculated that cash payments for certain contracts, including some involving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, prompted the internal investigation. But the company declined to confirm or deny that.
British news reports over the weekend indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s management was actively seeking a friendly takeover or cash infusion, and that top officials were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for such negotiations. However, the company's chairman, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Alun-Jones</ENAMEX>, and another top official were at home yesterday. They declined to be interviewed.
Meanwhile, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s own legal problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> are growing deeper as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> and other federal agencies step up a criminal investigation of his complicated finances and arms transactions over the years.
In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, his companies sold military equipment to, among others, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nigeria</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, according to defense-industry executives. Law-enforcement officials say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> grand-jury inquiry, which began well before the merger, is focusing on whether the sales complied with U.S. export license requirements and other laws. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>, who resigned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s board in May and sold all his 32 million shares in the company, also remains under investigation by a second <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> federal grand jury for separate dealings with the disgraced and nowbankrupt defense contractor he helped set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eight</ENAMEX> officials of the minority-owned firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Chem-Con Corp.</ENAMEX>, including former president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Christian</ENAMEX>, have pleaded guilty to participating in an elaborate conspiracy to defraud the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> of more than $12 million. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s brother-in-law, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Jacobson</ENAMEX>, another associate of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian</ENAMEX>, has admitted to bribing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> official and also is cooperating with investigators.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian</ENAMEX>, for his part, has told prosecutors and probation officers that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>, his mentor and a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Chem</ENAMEX>-Con director and creditor, was the driving force behind the company's operations. Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX> nor his lawyer could be reached for comment over the weekend, but in the past he has disputed that allegation.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX> has such a strong penchant for secrecy that he agreed to pay the former general counsel of one of his companies nearly $2 million in return for, among other things, a pledge that the lawyer wouldn't divulge information about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s activities or criticize him publicly. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX> is now contesting the agreement on the grounds that he was improperly coerced to sign it.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>, who prided himself on being a major benefactor of various community and charitable activities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX> area, has resigned from nearly all of his community posts, put much of his remaining business assets up for sale and moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>.
As part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Chem</ENAMEX>-Con inquiry, prosecutors also are investigating whether Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Mcdade</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>) violated election or bribery laws in accepting more than $45,000 in campaign contributions and speaking fees from officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Chem-Con</ENAMEX> and others affiliated with the company. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdade</ENAMEX> recently repaid nearly $20,000 to the trustees of the defunct company, while maintaining through his lawyer that he never acted improperly. Among the issues being examined by the grand jury are the links between Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdade</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>.
Regardless of how the criminal investigations are resolved, they already have hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s business. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> earlier this year canceled a $23 million contract for bomb fuses originally awarded to one of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s concerns, and additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> contract cancellations are likely. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> officials said that they expected that hundreds of workers at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s old plant near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, which is now part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti Defense Systems</ENAMEX>, will be laid off or transferred in the next few months.
