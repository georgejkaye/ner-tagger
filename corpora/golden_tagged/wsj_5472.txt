A man on the bench is fighting for some chairs.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> judge has decided he won't stand for another judge being denied four chairs because the state won't pay for them. So he's adding to a busy court calendar by taking the state's chief financial officer to court.
The case involves four office chairs ordered for a newly appointed judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX> at a potential cost to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> taxpayers of $3,745. When <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Comptroller <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Lewis</ENAMEX> saw the bill last spring, he refused to pay it.
The chairs -- one desk chair, two wing chairs and one ``English pub lounge chair and Ottoman'' -- carry a price tag more than three times what comparable furnishings would cost from other suppliers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> maintains. ``To me, it's a question of using some judgment, some discretion,'' he says.
Not to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monterey Campbell</ENAMEX>, west-central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>'s chief appellate judge. He filed suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> last week seeking a court order forcing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> to pay the bill.
The chairs were selected by the new judge, not for their extravagance, says Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX>, but for ``their lasting quality.'' There's a deep-seated legal question, as well, he adds: Does Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> have the legal authority to withhold payment?
The seating dispute has been simmering since June, when Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s court administrator wrote Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> to explain that the cost was justified: ``The chairs will be subjected to a good deal of wear.''
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> is more blunt: ``We spend a lot of time on our backsides reading. {We're} not having cocktail parties in there.'' So miffed is the judge that he has twice come to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX>'s office unannounced to inspect his furniture and order records of purchases by the comptroller's office.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> isn't taking the matter sitting down, either, though he concedes that defending the suit is likely to cost more than the furniture. And his office has had poor luck arguing with judges before.
Last month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> tried unsuccessfully to block payment for $3,161 worth of exercise equipment ordered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. Among the purchases:
A punching bag.
