In a move to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> earthquake, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> said it temporarily reassigned options listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> to the American, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> stock exchanges and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX>.
The decision, which affects millions of dollars of trading positions, was made late yesterday because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday's earthquake. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, faced with a major squeeze on options positions, said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange, guaranteeing the liquidity of the market.
Officials at the four exchanges said well over 50 traders from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange were taking flights from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> late yesterday to the American, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> exchanges and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CBOE</ENAMEX>, where they would continue making markets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>-listed options. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> said carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange. In addition, specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for market-making in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange options traded on the exchanges.
Trading was light on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday, with workers at the exchange's main floor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage.
The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues, including highly active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotels Corp.</ENAMEX>, which is listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>. Investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow.
But professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown wouldn't be a cause for alarm even if it were to persist for several days. ``I've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options, because they are guaranteed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Options Clearing Corp.</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Schwartz</ENAMEX>, a senior registered options strategist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> reassigned trading in the options, however, to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options.
While the exchange's equities floor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> remained open on a limited basis, orders were being routed and executed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. Workers could dial out, but they couldn't receive telephone calls. ``It's a very uncertain situation right now,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Navin Vyas</ENAMEX>, administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange, which has daily volume of about 10 million shares.
Because the exchange's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange's trading operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, ``business is as usual'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vyas</ENAMEX> said. ``If one city is down, the other can take over.''
Meanwhile, the brokerage firms in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were trying to cope. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Daggs</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sutro & Co.</ENAMEX>, said traders came to work at 5 a.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PDT</ENAMEX> -- many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions -- but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company's two main facilities there. That should happen by today, he said.
Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows, despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls. Also, most of the telecommunications equipment was out. The traders were executing municipal bond, mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucker Anthony Inc.</ENAMEX>, which is also owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Hancock Freedom Securities</ENAMEX> but is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``We are having a regular day. Volume is down out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, but not out of the 11 outlying offices,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daggs</ENAMEX> added. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sutro</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> office executed orders through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX> office, which wasn't affected by the quake.
Others, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>, which has eight offices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area, set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX> branch, Manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet White</ENAMEX> received calls yesterday morning from workers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> who offered to work in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX>. Then she discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quotron Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX> lines were down, because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks.
At Quotron, the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Call-In Center</ENAMEX>, which swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo, assembled a tactical team at 5 a.m. yesterday to begin rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders. The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area to do the work, though most of the rerouting was done by computer.
Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, while just parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Jose</ENAMEX> were knocked out. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Irvine</ENAMEX>, director of the emergency center, said service was being restored to outlying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> areas.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Options Clearing</ENAMEX> confirmed that it guarantees the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange options. The firm also will permit its members and the public ``to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange'' even if the exchange is closed, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Luthringshausen</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Options Clearing.</ENAMEX> (Put options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to sell a financial instrument at a specified price, while call options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy a financial instrument at a specified price).
Investors and traders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchange options ``are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luthringshausen</ENAMEX> said. ``We are seeing such exercises today, in fact.
