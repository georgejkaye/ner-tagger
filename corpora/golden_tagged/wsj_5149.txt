A hundred weary professionals, mateless and evidently desperate, have come to a shabby conference room of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel Roosevelt</ENAMEX> for a lesson in snaring a spouse. The go-between is 39-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena Amram</ENAMEX>. ``Love must grow slowly,'' she tells the crowd, ``but marriage should come quickly.''
She's talking three months.
By her account, repeatedly proclaimed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> may be the ``most successful'' matchmaker since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broadway</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dolly Levi</ENAMEX>. Her lovelier-than-life face in ads above the caption ``Beautiful women do not go to singles bars '' has made her well known in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, a media celebrity.
Successful she may be. She's definitely expensive. A match made by one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s underling cupids costs each client $5,500, whether or not it leads to matrimony, let alone wedded bliss. But if they tie the knot, the cupid gets a $500 bonus. And when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> gets involved personally in a major way, it is said to cost the client $20,000.
Her prices, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> stresses, cover the expense of having candidates checked out by her private investigator, by her psychologist, by her handwriting analyst. Clients themselves have to come up with the doctor's letter testifying they aren't diseased. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s ``very scientific'' system is supposed to ensure that her list of marriageables is studded with eligible bachelors and lovely ladies who wouldn't dream of cruising the bars. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helena's Personal Qualities Inc.</ENAMEX> is after all a marriage brokerage business, not a dating service (though she has one of those, too).
Her clip file contains more than 200 articles that mention her name. She has counted. She boasts of 8,000 marriages (most of them in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>), 15 branch offices (including outposts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and a new one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>) with annual revenue of $16 million. And she has plans to franchise. She claims a 60% success rate -- by which she means that six out of 10 clients make it to the altar. She knows of no ensuing divorces, though it isn't clear how diligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> is in statistical follow-up.
The queen of the lonely-hearts, herself happily married and living in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fair Lawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, wants more, more, more. ``I'm going to be the most famous rich lady you ever saw,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>. Like one famous former rich lady, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tammy Bakker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s own beauty relies rather heavily on thick pancake makeup, which a rival matchmaker snidely calls ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aunt Jemima.</ENAMEX>''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> has truly Hellenic ambitions. ``First there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Troy</ENAMEX>,'' she says. ``Then there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena Rubinstein</ENAMEX>. Now it's my turn.''
She isn't joking.
For some time she has been talking about the as yet largely unrealized plans she has for aggrandizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> empire. It is soon supposedly to include a private-detective agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helena Investigation International</ENAMEX>, ``the best idea I ever had in my life,'' she says. Singles who aren't availing themselves of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s full-service matchmaking would still be able to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s private eye to determine whether their dates are ``gold diggers, druggers, rapers or criminals.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> beams at the possibilities.
Then there is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helena Travel Club</ENAMEX>. And a promised <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> nightclub that she says will be ``better than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regine</ENAMEX>'s.'' And, in the offing, she swears, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena Marriage</ENAMEX> Line offering recorded advice and live counseling over the phone and a forthcoming, preordained ``best-seller'' called ``Have I Got a Match for You,'' to be published next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valentine</ENAMEX>'s Day by a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House</ENAMEX>. And as if all that weren't too much, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> has been shedding weight -- 37 pounds -- to get in shape for a daily television show her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Morris</ENAMEX> agent is trying to arrange. (Even matchmakers need arrangers.)
Her dreams of omnipresence delight the Israeli-born matchmaker, whose story brings elements of ``Fiddler on the Roof'' into the 1980s. She began her career by finding husbands for widowed friends after the Six Day War and soon thereafter opened offices throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>, becoming the nation's No. 1 marriage broker. She decamped to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, however, in 1979, after a client had claimed on TV that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> had fixed her up with three guys she didn't hit it off with -- an Arab, a criminal and a married man. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> sued the TV station for damaging her reputation, and won.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> herself gets sued now and then in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> by dissatisfied clients, but she feels that that is only to be expected. In her line of work, she insists, it would take God to satisfy everybody.
Nevertheless, she is always optimistic about the possibilities and can work her charm on the disenchanted. A 28-year-old car salesman bashful about having his name in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> recently presented himself at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helena</ENAMEX>'s Madison Avenue offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. He seeks a young woman with ``a fresh attitude toward life.'' But five months into his quest, he feels that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s people are matching him with a succession of ``burnouts,'' jaded women who have been around.
Barely has his gripe begun when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> shoves an eligible woman's photograph in his face and explains the situation: ``He needs someone down to earth, with a touch of sophistication, who won't try to change, overpower, or fix him.... She has to be sexy, warm, feminine. He needs someone not too intelligent -- not too out there -- who will make him feel like a man.'' The young man leaves, without a whimper.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s fans, mostly people she has married off, are unstinting in their praise, but not everyone warms to the experience. Recently, an executive recruiter and prospective client says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> dangled before her the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortimer Zuckerman</ENAMEX>, the real estate developer who owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News</ENAMEX> and The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Monthly</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Stern</ENAMEX>, the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartz</ENAMEX> Mountain and owner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX> Voice. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stern</ENAMEX> is married, as the would-be client pointed out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>. And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuckerman</ENAMEX> has never heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> denies this version of the story. The lady didn't sign up.
Ungrateful for her efforts are some of her clients who are single still, particularly some people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, where eight lawsuits are pending against her matchmaking service. (The litigants aren't happy with the number and quality of the introductions.) Her lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlan Schlossberg</ENAMEX>, says that since February, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> has settled five other suits and two letters of complaint, and that refunds in those cases amounted to about $15,000 all told. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York state</ENAMEX> attorney general's office says it has received eight letters of complaint about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s operation from consumers this year.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Blumenkrantz</ENAMEX>, 35, joined the ranks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s hopefuls a year ago, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s operatives in Fort <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, told the direct-mail broker that she would be introduced to a man a month and that wedding bells would be pealing. So says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenkrantz</ENAMEX>.
Her first date, as it happened, was with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Con Edison</ENAMEX> employee, who, she says, she had been assured had an MBA. He hadn't gone to college at all. The subsequent ``fire inspector'' was a fireman. And the ``gorgeous hunk,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenkrantz</ENAMEX> says, turned out to be a guy in ``a mink jacket, a heavy gold chain, with his hair flipped over a bald spot.''
After a grand total of four dates -- only one of which came close to meeting her specifications -- she is thinking of telling her story in court. She contends, ``I don't think they would turn down anyone -- unless he had a criminal record.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> dismisses the complaint. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blumenkrantz</ENAMEX> is carping ``about his fur coat and his chain... because she can't deal with rejection.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> adds: ``The only happy clients are married clients. I'm stuck with 40% of my clients. They are eating my heart out everyday.''
As a consequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> resorts to extreme measures. She holds ``rejection parties'': little affairs for singles who have, foolishly, previously rejected one another because of a photograph or telephone call. And because of a demographic problem -- a shortage of men over 40 -- she goes off on manhunts. Her favorite safaris are to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale Club</ENAMEX>, but she goes to other watering holes as well.
Thus, on the evening after her singles seminar, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> shows up at a restaurant and bar called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canastels</ENAMEX>. She has with her a stack of brochures -- and her own husband, who is associated with her in the business. (``Otherwise people will think I'm a bad woman.'') Within moments, she spots something promising. She moves right in on a table where two men are seated. ``Hi, I'm Helena. Are you married?'' she demands. (Men recruited in this fashion usually get ``scholarships.'' The $5,500 fee is waived.)
Alas, however, the man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> really craves is sporting a wedding band. But his divorced brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Schlossberg</ENAMEX>, is thrilled to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>, and it just so happens he feels the immediate need of her services. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Instantly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> leaves and returns with a blonde named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela</ENAMEX> he had been eyeing. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlossberg</ENAMEX>, who is chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria Vanderbilt Suits</ENAMEX> (and no kin to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>'s lawyer) gives one business card to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela</ENAMEX> and another to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> appeared like a genie,'' he later enthuses. ``Her approach is, like, amazing.''
By the following Monday, however, the honeymoon is over. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela</ENAMEX> hasn't called. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> has turned down his invitation to dinner. She wants him to come to her office for the standard routine. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlossberg</ENAMEX> thought dinner would be a better way to ``really communicate with her so she would take a special interest in me.''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena</ENAMEX> does have something in mind for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlossberg</ENAMEX>. He says, ``When I called up, she kicked in with this high-pitched sales thing about how they have the most'bee-yoo-tee-fool' women in the world. I wanted to talk thoughts. She wanted to throw bodies at me.
