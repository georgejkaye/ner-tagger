The first international closed-end fund for the Philippine stock market is being launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indosuez Asia Investment Services Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque Indosuez</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>.
Closed-end funds, which issue a fixed number of shares that are then traded on major stock markets, have become a popular way for investors to play the world's emerging equity markets. More than 40 single-country funds are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. At least half a dozen more, investing in countries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>, are in various stages of planning.
The $50 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manila Fund</ENAMEX> is expected to begin trading soon on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s stock exchange, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indosuez</ENAMEX> executives. The fund's launch gives Indosuez a lead over several other groups that are preparing closed-end funds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities International</ENAMEX> currently has its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine Fund Inc.</ENAMEX> in registration with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>. The fund is expected to begin trading on an American exchange late this year or in early 1990.
Two small open-end funds, which issue new shares directly to investors on demand, already exist for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippine</ENAMEX> market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardine Fleming Philippine Fund</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thornton Philippine Redevelopment Fund</ENAMEX>, both based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, manage less than $30 million combined. The two have been stellar performers since the fall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcos</ENAMEX> government in 1986; through August, they had risen an average 97% this year, according to figures from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Unit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trust Association</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Jovanovich</ENAMEX>, investment manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indosuez Asia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, said in an interview that enough Philippine shares have been acquired to invest about 40% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> Fund immediately. ``We've been picking up shares over the past four months as part of the portfolio,'' he said. ``Over a 12-month period, we'd like to be substantially invested.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indosuez Asia</ENAMEX> has developed a track record of creating single-country funds that are able to invest relatively quickly in small, thinly traded markets. It acquired big blocks of Thai shares for its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siam</ENAMEX> Fund before it was listed in early 1988, and of Indonesian stock for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malacca Fund</ENAMEX>, which began trading in January and was the first of a string of recently created Indonesia funds. Both are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> Fund is underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque Indosuez</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Finance Corp.</ENAMEX>, the investment arm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jovanovich</ENAMEX> said an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFC</ENAMEX> executive would sit on the fund's board.
The issue price for the fund's shares is $10 each, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jovanovich</ENAMEX> said he expects them to begin trading above that price. ``Initial indications are that the fund is heavily oversubscribed,'' he said.
Typically, new single-country funds begin trading at a premium to the value of their underlying portfolios. Some, particularly those investing in closed markets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>, have continued to trade at premiums after six months or so. Funds that invest in more-open markets, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, have at times traded at discounts.
Foreigners currently can purchase numerous Philippine shares, mainly as American depositary receipts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adrs</ENAMEX>, which are traded on American exchanges and are issued by banks, allow investors to own foreign shares indirectly.
