<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell Group PLC</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Craven</ENAMEX>, group chief executive officer, is taking over the chairmanship of the merchant banking group from Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Carey</ENAMEX>, who is retiring.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey</ENAMEX> will remain a member of the merchant bank's board.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craven</ENAMEX> is widely credited with refocusing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX>'s energies on its core corporate finance, fund management and banking activities over the past year. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX> shut down its ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> securities operations.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craven</ENAMEX> said his move to the chairmanship means he will take a less active role in the day-to-day management of the group, but he added that the merchant bank's strategic focus remains unchanged.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craven</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX> as group chief executive in May 1987, a few months after the resignations of former Chief Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Reeves</ENAMEX> and other top officials because of the merchant bank's role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness PLC</ENAMEX>'s controversial takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distiller's Co.</ENAMEX> in 1986.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX> had advised Guinness on the bid, which was surrounded by allegations that Guinness used artificial means to support the bid's value.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dobson</ENAMEX>, currently group deputy chief executive, will assume the chief executive position.
The merchant bank also announced that finance director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Eward</ENAMEX> is taking early retirement for personal reasons. His duties will be taken over by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Richmond-Watson</ENAMEX>, who has been elected deputy chairman.
News of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eward</ENAMEX>'s retirement comes one day after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Whittington</ENAMEX> resigned as chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX>'s banking subsidiary to join a financial services firm.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craven</ENAMEX> said both Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eward</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittington</ENAMEX> had planned to leave the bank earlier, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craven</ENAMEX> had persuaded them to remain until the bank was in a healthy position. ``If there's any coincidence about the departures it's that they are leaving at a time when the business is in reasonably good shape and going forward very well.'' Last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX> announced its pretax profit rose 49.6% to # 32.8 million in the first half, boosted by a healthy growth in its domestic and international corporate finance business.
