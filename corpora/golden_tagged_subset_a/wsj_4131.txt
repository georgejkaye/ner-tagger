<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa Midi Assurances</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Bebear</ENAMEX> vowed to continue his efforts to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group</ENAMEX> insurance unit, despite a restructuring plan announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> last week to fight off Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s hostile takeover bid.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX>'s comments in an interview Friday followed a decision by an appeals tribunal of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s Takeover Panel to uphold a ruling giving Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> more time to pursue its # 13.35 billion ($21.52 billion) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> bid. The appellate decision, which sets a precedent that could make hostile U.K. takeovers easier, means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> can start a new bid within 21 days of getting approval from U.S. insurance commissioners for a change in control of Farmers.
Last Tuesday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> proposed its radical restructuring to fend off Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>. The plan -- under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> would divest itself of # 4 billion in assets, including such U.S. retailing units as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX>'s -- aims to raise the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares beyond Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s reach. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> believes its plan -- which would transform it into a leaner tobacco and financial-services company -- will make it less vulnerable to a hostile bidder.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> dropped his offer Friday but he said he intends to continue to fight for U.S. regulatory clearance. He also said that only 0.05% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> holders had accepted his offer, giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> effective control over only 2.3% of the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> said the ``minuscule'' level of acceptances showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>'s proposals ``are wholly unacceptable'' to shareholders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares rose two pence to 820 pence Friday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
In the interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s restructuring plan simply accepts many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>'s ideas without going far enough in breaking up the giant company. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> will still be a conglomerate with a curious melange of tobacco and insurance interests. To me, that doesn't change much,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said he is still interested in buying Farmers. But he indicated that he doesn't intend to bid to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> insurer directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> if it eludes Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>. Such an offer would be unlikely to succeed -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> wants to keep Farmers, which it bought for $5.2 billion late last year, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> is offering Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> $4.5 billion, or $700 million less. Said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX>: ``We are in a deal with Jimmy. If he can't deliver the goods, we can't buy them.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said that by the end of this week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> expects to complete the submissions to state insurance commissioners that are required for regulatory approval.
He also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> believes several other U.S. insurance properties would be alluring acquisition targets if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> fails to buy Farmers. He declined to identify them and declined to say whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Axa</ENAMEX> has a timetable for expanding in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North American</ENAMEX> market. But he said he would be ``disappointed'' if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> doesn't have a more significant presence within four to five years.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said he and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> are discussing ways to coordinate their U.S. regulatory efforts. People close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> say the  group may be close to dropping federal suits in several jurisdictions seeking to remove the state regulators' power to review the bid. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> said he asked Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> to drop the suits.
