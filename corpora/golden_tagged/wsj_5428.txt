In a move that some predict will raise questions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> is introducing Sealtest Free Nonfat Ice Cream, the first national brand of ice cream that is virtually free of fat and cholesterol.
The food giant, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX>, claims its new entrant has the appearance and taste of butterfat-rich products. It is using cellulose gel, a natural ingredient widely used in foods, as a bulking agent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cellulose</ENAMEX> gel is a naturally occurring dietary fiber found in fruit and vegetables such as apples and celery.
``This development is creating a hubbub among industry experts,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Huggins</ENAMEX>, a dairy industry consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. ``If this cellulose formulation is the equivalent in its functional properties to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Simplesse</ENAMEX>, it may be a real breakthrough.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simplesse</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutrasweet Co.</ENAMEX> fat substitute that is awaiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> predicted the new product will provoke ``some labeling problems with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'' because a product must contain 10% butterfat to be called ice cream.
``There will be questions from regulators and certainly their competitors will ask questions,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> said. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. Typically, food companies label low-fat ice cream as ice milk.
According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX> spokesman, the company is submitting a suggestion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> on ``how to revise current frozen dessert standards.'' He said the letter would go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> by the end of the month and said the company was meeting with industry groups to get a consensus before the submission was made.
``We believe the term'nonfat ice cream' is very appropriate for Sealtest,'' he added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sealtest Free</ENAMEX> has less than half a gram of fat and less than two milligrams of cholesterol per half-cup serving. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sealtest</ENAMEX>'s regular vanilla ice cream has seven grams of fat and 20 milligrams of cholesterol per serving. The new product will have about 100 calories per serving compared with 140 calories for traditional vanilla ice cream.
Calling the new product nonfat ice cream mirrors a strategy Kraft already has used successfully. A few years ago, the company came under fire from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX> for its labeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft Light Naturals Reduced Fat Cheeses</ENAMEX>. Regulators initially took the position that the label was misleading because the product failed to meet the criteria of traditional cheese.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kraft</ENAMEX> argued its label wasn't confusing because the term ``reduced fat'' provided a clear distinction to consumers. The controversy appears to have died down, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huggins</ENAMEX> said, ``because the regulators aren't stopping Kraft from doing it and other competitors have followed suit.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sealtest Free</ENAMEX> represents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX>' latest move to become a major player in the low-to-no-fat foods arena. In August, it announced it placed an order for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simplesse</ENAMEX>, the first that Nutrasweet has received. The company is also developing a substitute of its own.
