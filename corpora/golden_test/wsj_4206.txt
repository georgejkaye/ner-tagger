In the wake of a 31% rise in fiscal first-quarter earnings, Conagra Inc. directors raised the food processor's quarterly cash dividend 17% and declared a 3-for-2 stock split.
Both moves are payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 3.
At its annual shareholders meeting yesterday, Conagra said it boosted its quarterly cash dividend on pre-split shares to 22.5 cents a share from 19.25 cents a share. After the 3-for-2 stock split, the effective quarterly dividend rate will be 15 cents a share on post-split shares.
Conagra said the stock split will increase its common shares outstanding to 120 million from 80 million.
Last week, Conagra said earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. 27 rose 31% to $49.9 million, or 60 cents a share, from $38.1 million, or 48 cents a share, for the same 1988 quarter. Sales rose 43% to $4 billion from $2.8 billion, primarly because Conagra bought the 50% stake in Swift Independence Packing Co. that it didn't already own.
Conagra also announced yesterday that its directors amended its three-year-old shareholder rights plan so that they can redeem the rights with Conagra stock.
Earlier, the rights could only be redeemed for cash, Conagra said.
Conagra said its directors amended the plan so that each right to acquire Conagra stock at one-half market value will be activated in the event a person acquires 20% or more of Conagra common shares outstanding.
Conagra said it isn't aware of any takeover interest in the company.
Conagra stock rose $1.375 a share yesteday to close at $39, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
