A House subcommittee said in a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epilepsy Foundation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> that it has ``no confidence'' that generic anti-epileptic drugs are safe.
The subcommittee said its investigation ``leaves us with no confidence'' that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> ``has the ability, or that a significant portion of the generic drug industry has the integrity, to assure that the manufacture of extremely sensitive medications'' is safe.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the subcommittee, also asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> in a letter to review ``all drugs used to treat epilepsy and any other narrow therapeutic range medication'' made by generic drug companies that are considered equivalent to brand name drugs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specifically</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> subcommittee cited a 1988 recall of carbamazepine, an anti-epileptic drug made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmaceutical Basics Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo N.V.</ENAMEX> The subcommittee also said it has ``preliminary information'' that two other generic drug makers ``may have made misrepresentations'' to obtain FDA clearance for diazepam, the generic version of Valium, also used for epilepsy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmaceutical Basics</ENAMEX> said in a statement that its recall of carbamazepine was due to problems with the drug properly dissolving. The company said that isn't ``an unusual problem for this particular drug regardless of the manufacturer.'' It added that it has increased controls to its manufacturing process to assure the safety and efficacy of the product.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> said it is in the process of reviewing the country's top 30 selling drugs, including some anti-seizure medications, and that it hasn't turned up any serious problems. One of the most common problems, an agency spokesman said, is that drugs don't dissolve properly. The Dingell subcommittee contended carbamazepine problems were the result of the firm switching ``from a more expensive to a cheaper raw material supplier.'' But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmaceutical Basics</ENAMEX> said any implication ``that our choice of either of our suppliers of this raw material was based on cost consideration rather than quality and continuity of supply is wrong.''
Several people had seizures because the drug passed through their bodies without dissolving, and at least one person died, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FDA</ENAMEX> recall report. Hospital records indicated that the tablets were ``sub-therapeutic,'' the report said.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmaceutical Basics</ENAMEX> contended, ``any implication that the problems we had with this drug... caused mortality is wrong.'' The company said side effects, including death, result from both generic and brand name drugs.
