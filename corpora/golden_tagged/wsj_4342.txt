<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch Cos.</ENAMEX>, angling to triple its theme park business, landed Shamu the killer whale and six parks from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.</ENAMEX> through a definitive accord valued at $1.1 billion.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based brewing giant, which operates <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Busch Gardens</ENAMEX> theme parks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Williamsburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, had emerged in recent weeks as the most likely buyer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX> and other theme parks that the financially ailing publisher and insurance company put on the block last June. The sale is expected to be completed in November, Anheuser-Busch said.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, reportedly was flooded with bids for the parks, the purchase price came in on the low end of estimates that ranged as high as $2 billion.
In part because of the low purchase price, Wall Street analysts are paring their 1990 earnings estimate only slightly for Anheuser-Busch. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emanuel Goldman</ENAMEX>, an analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, said the purchase would probably dilute 1990 earnings about 3%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accordingly</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldman</ENAMEX> lowered his earnings estimate yesterday for 1990 to $3.13 a share from $3.20 a share.
In trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX> common stock closed up 62.5 cents, at $42.25. Harcourt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brace Jovanovich</ENAMEX> also closed up 62.5 cents, at $16.25.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX> is selling the theme parks for less than expected, the sale should significantly improve its financial position. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX> said it would use $930 million of initial net proceeds to pay some of its $1.12 billion of long-term bank debt.
That lump payment should lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s interest bill by roughly $115 million a year, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Berardi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s senior vice president and treasurer. In contrast, after annual capital expenditures, the parks had generated only about $75 million of cash for debt service, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berardi</ENAMEX>.
``It will free us of a whole lot of debt, and allow management to have both the time and resources to dedicate to our primary publishing business,'' he said.
Although theme parks are a small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX>'s business, the acquisition was attractive because it allows the nation's biggest beer producer to combine the marketing of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa Busch</ENAMEX> Gardens theme park with three <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX> parks near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>.
What's more, beverage industry analysts figure that Anheuser-Busch has the marketing talent and advertising muscle to exploit here and overseas the recognition value of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World's</ENAMEX> Shamu the killer whale.
In addition to Anheuser-Busch, other bidders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s theme parks were said to have included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX>
Industry analysts estimate that the acquisition will triple the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX>'s theme park business, which generated 1988 revenue of about $175 million. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX> theme parks generated revenue last year of $388 million. In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX> operated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World parks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aurora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif</ENAMEX>. The sale also includes its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boardwalk and Baseball park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cypress Gardens</ENAMEX> park in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Winter Haven</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>
Anheuser-Busch paid $975 million for the six theme parks, which had 14 million vistors last year, and about $125 million for land surrounding some of the parks. Analysts expect Anheuser-Busch to sell some of that land.
Under terms of the purchase accord, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX> is entitled to some of the profit from any sales of undeveloped land in certain circumstances over the next 10 years.
About six million people attended Anheuser-Busch's theme parks last year. In addition to the two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Busch Gardens</ENAMEX> parks, it operates a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX> water park called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adventure Island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sesame Place</ENAMEX>, a child-oriented park near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. Anheuser-Busch is also building a theme park and resort in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>.
The theme park sale is the bitter pill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX> has to swallow because of the expensive manner in which it fended off a hostile takover bid by British publishing giant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maxwell</ENAMEX> two years ago. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Jovanovich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s chairman, engineered a $2.9 billion recapitalization by borrowing more than $2 billion.
The company said after that maneuver that it would need more cash to cover debts, but, until it put the parks up for sale in June, it promised it wouldn't sell core assets.
``All along we said we didn't intend to sell assets,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berardi</ENAMEX>. ``When we made those statements, that was our intentions. But the business world changes.''
Though the sale eases <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s long-term bank obligations, the company still owes about $1.6 billion of junk-bond debt. Loan covenants require Harcourt to pay the bank debt before the high-yield notes, which, at upwards of 14% interest, are much more weighty than the bank debt, which carries a 12% interest rate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison Price</ENAMEX>, the theme-park consultant who did the original feasibility studies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney's parks</ENAMEX>, said the price <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX> received was lower than expected because of huge deferred-maintenance costs facing the new owner.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> estimates Anheuser-Busch will have to invest at least $100 million to spruce up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World parks</ENAMEX> -- which have turned a bit shabby from neglect during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s financial woes -- and to add new attractions.
``The parks were deteriorating,'' he said, ``and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disney</ENAMEX> has put the fear of God in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> competitors'' with its popular four-day passes to the recently expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney World.</ENAMEX>
