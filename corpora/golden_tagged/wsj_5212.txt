<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Wilson</ENAMEX> had come so far.
From his working-class neighborhood in a black section of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, he had made it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> law school. He had become a top official in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX>, eventually earning a personal fortune from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>-related transactions after he left the agency. He had become a Wall Street investment banker with all the trappings: a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>, a 25-foot pleasure boat, an $825,000 condominium on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Upper East</ENAMEX> Side and a summer house on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>.
A crowning moment came in the evening hours of Feb. 25, 1988. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> had helped to arrange a dinner in the executive dining room at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, with some 40 celebrators honoring his old boss: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce</ENAMEX>. In a private meeting just before the dinner began, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> introduced Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> to his boss: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Marron</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>.
The brokerage concern had every reason to hire the young Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> -- and later to sponsor the dinner honoring Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>. Within two months of the event, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> would be hired as financial adviser to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>, despite the fact that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> review panel had recommended another firm. A month after that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>, working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials, would underwrite a huge government-backed bond issue, earning unusually large fees in the process.
While functioning as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> also helped to open a multibillion-dollar market in new mortgage-backed securities in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> has participated. In a letter saluting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s ``good work'' on the matter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s chairman noted: ``It was a pleasure to hear that this will probably result in very significant business for us.''
But now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s ties to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> are proving to be a two-edged sword for the $2.5 billion-a-year financial services concern. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s is the only major corporate name to surface in the long-running scandal involving the plundering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> programs by well-connected Republicans. The firm's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marron</ENAMEX> is scheduled to testify next Wednesday before a House subcommittee, which asked that he discuss, among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s policy on ``influence peddling by its employees to secure contracts.''
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lantos</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, the subcommittee chairman, emphasizes that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>. But, he adds, ``I think Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was an important player at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> activities. I want to find out what they paid him and why they paid him.''
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> is scheduled to turn over to the panel an internal report on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> activities. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James C. Treadway Jr.</ENAMEX>, the firm's general counsel, says the concern hasn't turned up any evidence of ``improper influence,'' adding that ``not one single allegation of wrongdoing'' has been leveled against the company.
Nonetheless, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s once-promising Wall Street career is now imperiled because of the thumping he's taking over his role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal. Renowned for political savvy, disarming charm and intelligence, the 41-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> requested and received administrative leave with pay after members of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX>'s subcommittee accused him of cashing in on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> programs. In at least one transaction, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> as an underwriter on a bond deal that personally benefited him.
Congressional investigators are probing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s ties to a developer whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, while still at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>, had supported in a successful bid for agency funds. Investigators are also looking into Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s ownership, with other former senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials, of at least five apartment projects that received rent subsidies at a time when such funds were very hard to come by. Investigators estimate that the sale of tax credits on four of the projects alone produced over $2 million for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>.
His lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Banoun</ENAMEX>, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> has done nothing improper, and that he waited the full year required by federal law before dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> on his private investments. ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> is an intelligent businessman who is being unfairly criticized for the apparent sin of having been successful in his business endeavors,'' he says. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> intends to invoke his 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when he appears before lawmakers, also on Wednesday, his lawyer says.
While publicly expressing support for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> privately is playing down his role at the firm, suggesting that he was an adequate employee, but no superstar. ``His title,'first  vice president,' it sounds highfalutin,'' says a senior company official. But ``there are 185 first vice presidents alone.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> bristles at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s description. ``If I was so mediocre,'' he asks through his lawyer, ``how come I was making several hundred thousand dollars a year in salary and bonus?''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> is moving to distance itself from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> in other ways. The company official notes that earlier this year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> urged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> elect his old boss, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, to its board. The official adds that the company's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marron</ENAMEX> rejected the idea after meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>. ``He just was not impressed,'' the official says.
Although they were a generation apart, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> were part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s tiny elite of black lawyers educated in the Ivy League. In the 1960s, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> was the first black lawyer to become a partner at a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm. When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Penn</ENAMEX> law school in 1972, there was still only a handful of black associates working at the city's major law firms.
The two men were introduced by a mutual friend over lunch around the time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was graduating. ``Lance heard a lot about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> as a black leader and black Republican and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> became his mentor,'' says a person close to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>. Friends of both men say that the two lawyers quickly fell into a father-son relationship, with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> providing a role model as someone who had succeeded in the realms in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> aspired to have clout: law and politics. (Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> chose to be interviewed for this story.)
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> joined a law firm then known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mudge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guthrie & Alexander</ENAMEX>, whose partners had once included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> and the man who became his attorney general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mitchell</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, a partner in the law firm of Battle Fowler, had lunch regularly with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, who served as a director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Lawyers</ENAMEX> for Reagan-Bush in 1980. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> secretary by the incoming administration, took Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, where he would eventually describe his protege as his ``right hand.''
Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> aides say that over the next 3 1/2 years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> helped set the political tone of the agency, where political insiders and friends had a leg up in getting a share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s largess. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was a master of gentle persuasion -- a consensus-seeker who seldom overruled underlings or took actions that could boomerang. His style stands in stark contrast to an aide whom he hired in 1982: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Gore Dean</ENAMEX>, the leader of the youthful ``brat pack'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> who eventually succeeded him, and whose activities have heretofore been the central focus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> maintained close ties to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean</ENAMEX> after he left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> officials said last night that in reviewing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s expense accounts they had found, among other things, that he was reimbursed for picking up a $1,100 tab for a dinner for Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean</ENAMEX> and others in 1986. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s attorney said that the dinner wasn't an attempt to ``influence them in their official positions.''
Upon clearing the way for Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> and leaving Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s side in May 1984, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> became president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York City Housing Development Corp.</ENAMEX>, a quasi-public entity that provides bond financing for low - and moderate-income multi-family housing projects. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> officials had a strong acquaintance with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. ``Lance was always very supportive of projects in the city,'' says former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Housing</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Gliedman</ENAMEX>, now an aide to developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>.
Before long, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> secretary tried to get his right hand back. In 1985, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> wanted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> as his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Housing Commissioner</ENAMEX>, but couldn't get the go-ahead from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> officials say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s appointment was blocked after questions arose about his dealings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>, including whether a developer had bought him a car.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> produced records showing he had paid for the car, according to his attorney. Still, he was never nominated and in January 1986 withdrew from consideration as housing commissioner.
What has most aroused congressional investigators about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> are his dealings, largely before he joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>-based developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Briscoe</ENAMEX>.
In 1983, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was still at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>, he supported $7 million in federal aid for a Briscoe apartment project in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> investigators.
Then in October 1984, only a few months after he left the agency, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briscoe</ENAMEX> formed a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> consulting company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Community Consultants Inc.</ENAMEX> (Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s lawyer says that only Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> did any actual consulting, and that the work never involved any of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briscoe</ENAMEX>'s projects.)
In 1985, a little more than a year after leaving the agency, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> received a 15% interest -- then valued at $750,000 -- in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HUD</ENAMEX>-backed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> apartment project in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briscoe</ENAMEX> was the general partner.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s lawyer says his client got the stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> project for advising Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briscoe</ENAMEX> and representing him before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. The lawyer says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s work for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briscoe</ENAMEX> was separate from their consulting business and done only once Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was legally allowed to appear before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. The lawyer insists that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briscoe</ENAMEX>'s award to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> wasn't in connection with any action Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> took while working at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>.
After Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> in early 1986, the brokerage firm says, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> got the company involved as an underwriter on a $15.8 million bond issue that financed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> project owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briscoe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> and others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Company</ENAMEX> officials say that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> properly disclosed his personal stake in the project, and that there was nothing improper in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> arranging financing for it.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s duties in the public finance group involved getting bond-underwriting business from state and local housing finance agencies, a job at which he excelled, by many accounts. He was polished and unflappable, as if he has stepped from the pages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GQ magazine</ENAMEX>, many former friends and associates say. In the competitive environs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>, he operated as effortlessly as he had in the drab hallways of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>.
``He was a very sharp, very bright banker. I mean, he understood housing, he clearly understood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> (programs) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> regulations,'' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Reisert</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> executive. ``He had a good, technical grasp of finance.''
``He had great connections in the cities,'' adds another of his former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> colleagues. ``He had the ability to go into state and local governments and open doors.'' This colleague, marveling at his extensive political contacts, describes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> office as a political ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fame</ENAMEX>'' for all its photographs of elected dignitaries. He was an active fund-raiser for Republican candidates including his friend, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonse D'Amato</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> itself also was giving generously to the Republican party -- $100,000 in 1988 -- but says the donation was unrelated to its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> work. In addition, the brokerage firm kicked in $5,000, along with $3,250 from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, to a charity, called F.O.O.D. for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, whose founders included one of the federal housing commissioners who served under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>.
One of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s connections led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> -- a giant, federally sponsored company, generally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>, that buys mortgages from lenders, packages some for sale as securities and retains the rest in its portfolio. While working at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> in early 1987 became a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX>, which advises the enterprise on mortgage-industry issues. Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s important financial activities are regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>.
At the time, Wall Street and the housing industry were hotly debating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s wish to issue a new type of mortgage-backed security called a Remic -- for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit</ENAMEX>. Supporters and opponents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s involvement in the new market lobbied Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> intently. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>'s request, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> huddled with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> and urged his old boss to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> the authority -- a position fully supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>, which recognized the potential for underwriting fees.
Within a month of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> advisory board, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> limited authority to issue as much as $15 billion of the new securities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s chairman, in a congratulatory letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, envisioned reaping ``very significant business.'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie May</ENAMEX> was given unlimited authority by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> last October.) Since the the 1987 decision, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> has been active in the Remic field. Last August, it served as manager of a $400 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> issue, and has issued Remics of its own, including a $500 million offering last March.
After his victory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> matter, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> tapped yet another of his associations. He helped arrange a fund-raising dinner for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Global Economic Action Institute</ENAMEX>, a research organization of which he was a member, to honor the work of Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> at the Feb. 25, 1988, dinner, which was hosted and paid for by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>.
At the private meeting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> arranged before dinner between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> secretary and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> chairman, the two men discussed ``general pleasantries and the sad state of the homeless,'' according to an official of the firm, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s interest in doing business with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>.
But before long, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was opening other doors to help admit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> to a lucrative business involving the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> loan assets. The agency, under a mandate from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to sell off assets for cash to help reduce the federal deficit, wanted a financial adviser on hundreds of millions in asset sales -- an engagement potentially worth $1.3 million. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> provided ``technical advice'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s 100-page proposal and kept the firm abreast of how the competition was going, according to a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> official.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> was competing with four other financial-services concerns for the contract. And ultimately, a seven-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> advisory panel recommended another concern -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX>.
The panel's choice, however, was rejected by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s undersecretary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Covitz</ENAMEX>, who in an April 1988 memo designated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> because of its ``extensive, direct experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> programs'' and its financial expertise. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covitz</ENAMEX> says he doesn't remember whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> ever voiced a preference on the matter. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covitz</ENAMEX> also says he doesn't recall ever being lobbied by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> for the job. But someone close to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> says that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> spoke to a Covitz aide shortly before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covitz</ENAMEX> picked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> wasn't the only firm on Wall Street to benefit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> asset sales. Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm, Battle Fowler, was hired as legal adviser on the transactions by the underwriters chosen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> for the asset sales. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s former firm was promoted for the engagement by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, according to a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> official. The law firm and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> deny any impropriety.
At the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> wasn't only advising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> on asset sales but also was representing a client interested in buying a huge chunk of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> loan assets, with a face value of $388.7 million. These assets were separate from the assets on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> was serving as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s financial adviser. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials nevertheless acknowledge they were concerned about a possible conflict of interest, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> representing both the seller and buyer of various agency assets. The officials put aside their concerns after reviewing a legal opinion asserting that ``no conflict of interest should arise.'' The opinion was written by a lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>.
The transaction involved the sale of below-market interest-rate loans, or Bmirs, that were issued in the 1960s and 1970s to developers of low income housing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>-supervised operation best known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX>, wanted to unload the paper. But lawmakers and state housing officials expressed concern that unless the sale were structured with special safeguards, property owners could pay off the mortgages early, freeing themselves from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> restrictions on the use of the properties. Some of the 46,000 units of affected low-income housing, they feared, were in jeopardy of being upgraded to condominiums or other uses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> helped to conceive a solution -- one that, with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s involvement, would bring a huge fee. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> would underwrite a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX>-backed bond issue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkansas Development Finance Authority</ENAMEX>, which would use the proceeds to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> mortgages. Working with housing agencies from other states, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arkansas</ENAMEX> pledged to use income from the mortgages to subsidize additional low-cost housing and to offer incentives to owners to retain the units as low-cost housing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed a law specifically permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX>, in the interests of preserving low-income housing, to sell the assets to a state agency in a negotiated sale -- without seeking competitive bids. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> team still had to convince <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> of the soundness of the deal.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was an important player in that effort, according to a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> executive. ``He had a lot of stature'' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials, the former official executive recalls. ``They were comfortable with him -- I mean the people at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> trusted him.'' This executive's nickname for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>: ``first vice president in charge of relationships.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> blessed the transaction, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> housing agency says it paid Painewebber a total of $5.4 million in underwriting and finder's fees. The agency's former president, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wooten Epes</ENAMEX>, terms the underwriting portion of the fee ``higher than normal'' -- in fact, nearly twice the usual rate. But, he explains, ``This wasn't a normal deal. It was a one-time deal never repeated,'' adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> worked long and hard developing an innovative financial structure needed to preserve the housing for needy families.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> says its profits from the fees totaled about $3.5 million -- the equivalent of nearly 5% of the concern's pretax 1988 earnings. ``It was a nice transaction, a complicated transaction that we worked hard on, and we were nicely compensated,'' a company official says.
These days, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> waits for word from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> on whether it will summon him back from leave while his friends anguish over his plight. ``I regret very much that he is in this thing,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Britton Jr.</ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> official and former U.S. ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barbados</ENAMEX> who has known him for 13 years. ``When you think of him coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bedford</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stuyvesant</ENAMEX>... he went on to make quite a success out of himself.
