<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>, with its agreement to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>, could be playing home wrecker to one of Madison Avenue's longest and happiest marriages.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> and its ad agency, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic Group</ENAMEX>, have been together for 40 years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, helped conceive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s Cover Girl makeup -- ``the clean, fresh, natural look'' -- 28 years ago. It has created every ad Cover Girl has ever run, along with scores of ads for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Noxzema</ENAMEX> and other Noxell products.
Yet now, the agency appears to be in jeopardy of losing the entire account, with billings of more than $50 million. The problem arose Friday when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> announced its agreement to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> in a $1.3 billion stock swap -- a move that abruptly would make Lintas a Procter agency. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX>'s largest client by far is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter</ENAMEX>'s fiercest rivals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> have never stood for sharing an agency yet, and are unlikely to become bedfellows now.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Weithas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, is trying to be optimistic. ``You can bet your life I'm going to try'' to convince both clients to co-exist, he said in an interview Friday. He said he had spoken to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin L. Hathaway</ENAMEX>, who had assured him that Lintas ``is an integral part of our success.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weithas</ENAMEX> added, ``We're all realistic. We've got to sit down and have discussions with all involved. This is really in the clients' hands, not in our hands.''
The loss of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> account would be an especially bitter blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lintas</ENAMEX>. Apart from its considerable size, the account is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX>'s showcase clients. It was the agency's first U.S. client. Its Cover Girl line, which Lintas suggested and helped develop, is now the largest-selling cosmetics line in the country. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX> uses the brand's success story to pitch prospective business.
Yet Noxell, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter</ENAMEX> unit, wouldn't stand a chance against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> bills more than $500 million world-wide at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX>, accounting for a sizable chunk of the agency's total $3.59 billion in 1988 billings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX> was in fact founded as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX>'s in-house agency, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> retained a stake in it until about a decade ago. While Unilever no longer has any financial interest in the agency, it is far and away Lintas's largest, and longest-standing, client.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spokeswomen</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter</ENAMEX> said it was too early to comment on whether conflicts existed, or how conflicts might be resolved. Both said, however, that no immediate changes are planned for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s advertising. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> shareholders won't vote on the proposed acquisition until November, and the transaction probably won't close until near year-end.
Still, the latest turn of events is yet another sign of how consolidations among both agencies and clients are making it increasingly difficult to avoid client conflicts. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Procter</ENAMEX> must choose another agency for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> -- either because it pulls the account or Unilever pressures Lintas into resigning the account -- it will find its choice extremely limited, as most major agencies not working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter</ENAMEX> are working for its competitors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> uses a second major agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Burnett</ENAMEX>, for its Clarion line; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burnett</ENAMEX> is already a Procter agency and could be considered for future assignments.
Meanwhile, industry executives already have begun speculating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX> might take on another cosmetics line, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maybelline</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering-Plough</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Mulloy</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maybelline</ENAMEX> executive vice president, said there was ``no truth at all'' to the speculation, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maybelline</ENAMEX> is ``very happy'' with its two agencies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnicom</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weithas</ENAMEX> didn't comment specifically on other potential cosmetics clients. ``We love our client Noxell,'' he said. ``But the fact of the matter is, {if it leaves}, its potential isn't going to sit around and not be utilized.''
