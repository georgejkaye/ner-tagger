The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX> ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seabrook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.H.</ENAMEX>, nuclear-power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full-power license.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Shannon</ENAMEX>, opposing the license, said he will appeal the ruling in federal court. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seabrook</ENAMEX> officials said the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRC</ENAMEX> rejected Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon</ENAMEX>'s argument that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, which owns the largest share of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seabrook</ENAMEX>, and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant's safe operation. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon</ENAMEX> was seeking a waiver of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRC</ENAMEX> policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions.
In its ruling, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRC</ENAMEX> said that because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seabrook</ENAMEX> will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs, consideration of the owners' financial condition is pointless.
``The commissioners found the circumstances of the case didn't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation,'' said a commission spokesman.
In January 1988, the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, allowing it to continue to operate while protected from creditors' lawsuits.
