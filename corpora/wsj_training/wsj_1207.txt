<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid Inc.</ENAMEX>, reflecting strong earnings growth, boosted its quarterly dividend 18%, to 13 cents a share from 11 cents.
The maker of household products said the new dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 10.
Separately, the company's board adopted a proposal to amend its 1986 shareholder rights plan, further insulating the company from takeover.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> officials said they aren't aware of any effort to take over the company, but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened. ``The board has stated repeatedly that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> should be independent,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W. Williams</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> president.
Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments, but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds 25% or more of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX>'s voting securities, each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> shares with a market value of twice the right's exercise price.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> said the exercise price is $125, meaning holders would have the right to buy $250 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> stock for half price, diluting the investor's 25% stake.
For the third quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> earned $32.6 million, or 44 cents a share, up 16% from $28.1 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 9.7% to $351.5 million from $320.4 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbermaid</ENAMEX> shares closed yesterday at $33.875, off 12.5 cents, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
