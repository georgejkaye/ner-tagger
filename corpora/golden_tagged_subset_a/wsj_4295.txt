<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> and the labor-management group bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> have begun lobbying to avert any government-imposed changes in their $6.79 billion bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX>
The effort follows news that Transportation Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> has persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> to reduce a stake taken by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX> to limit the influence of foreign airlines on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers.
The group, apparently surprised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX>'s tough stance against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>, is hoping to avert a similar change that could delay or derail its purchase, set to close late next month. The group's campaign is likely to encompass both politics and finance.
British government aviation officials urged ``an open and free investment climate'' at a previously scheduled meeting Tuesday with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Transportation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> officials. But an aide to British Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> said she hadn't made any calls to U.S. officials.
Financially, the group can argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>'s $750 million investment meets a 25% limit on foreign stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines even though it represents 78% of $965 million in cash the buyers are putting forth. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> is forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> to cut its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> stake to $175 million, 25% of $700 million in cash equity used by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Checchi</ENAMEX> to finance the purchase.
That argument will rest mainly on the idea that $200 million in expected annual employee concessions represents ``sweat equity'' worth about $1.2 billion, at the going rate for airline takeovers of six times cash flow.
Counting $15 million from management, $200 million from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> pilots and $750 million from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>, that would put the total equity at $2.17 billion. Using that denominator, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>'s stake would be 35%. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> speeds up a  resale of $300 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> preferred stock, its $450 million would be only 21%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politically</ENAMEX>, the buyers are expected to enlist elected officials to speak out in favor of the bid's 75% employee ownership.
Yesterday, in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> floor speech, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Byrd</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">W.va.</ENAMEX>) said that despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>'s stake, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> ``will remain a truly American asset'' because employees are participating. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> said the employee takeover of once-faltering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weirton Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> in his home state represents a ``major success story of employee ownership.''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Byrd</ENAMEX> aide said the senator fears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United transaction</ENAMEX>, which would result in the largest employee-owned company in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> history, will fall apart if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> is forced to reduce its equity stake.
The group can also be expected to question the strength of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX>'s own mandate within the Bush administration to crack down on foreign airline investment.
``I can't for the life of me figure out why foreign investment is the battlefield he decided to pick,'' said one person familiar with the United buy-out. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> has also expressed concern over the financial risk of airline leveraged buy-outs. ``What constituency really cares about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM</ENAMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NWA</ENAMEX>?''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> sharply criticized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> and warned him against taking any action that could derail the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> deal. Characterizing his handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> as ``creative freelancing,'' Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> accused the secretary of exceeding his authority in pressuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> to reduce its stake.
The senator said he was concerned about the ``attitude of the energetic secretary of transportation toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> takeover,'' and added that ``it would be imprudent of him to attempt to disrupt the timely completion of this rather exciting development.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> executives agreed. ``We think Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> accurately stated the case about why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>'s employee-ownership proposal makes sense for this country from a policy perspective and why it is consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Nagin</ENAMEX>.
But some lawmakers approve of Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX>'s actions so far, and support legislation codifying his authority to approve or reject <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> as a whole is really uncomfortable with leveraged buy-outs,'' said an aide to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendell Ford</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the aviation subcommittee.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> spokesman denied the airline is participating in any lobbying campaign. ``This is strictly a U.S. domestic matter. We are confident this will be approved,'' he said. But the carrier has informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Embassy</ENAMEX> officials of its stake in the deal.
Another difference between the buy-outs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> is that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> has far more political clout in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> executives were said to be angered at the airline's treatment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest-Skinner</ENAMEX> talks. But since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> agreed to the cutback, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> appeared to have little recourse.
