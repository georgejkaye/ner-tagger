<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Products Inc.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to sell its Valentino fragrance business and the inventory of its Parfums Stern unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valentino Group</ENAMEX> for about $12.3 million in cash and notes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon</ENAMEX>, which wouldn't give sales figures for Stern, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stern</ENAMEX> has marketed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valentino</ENAMEX> fragrances world-wide under a license from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valentino Perfumes</ENAMEX> for four years. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon</ENAMEX> spokesman said Stern was a ``not very large contributor'' to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avon</ENAMEX>'s profit. Avon recently reported first-half net income of $45.7 million, or 51 cents a share, reversing a loss in last year's first half of $55.3 million.
Avon expects the sale to be completed within a month. It said it expects to realize a gain on the sale and that proceeds will be used to reduce debt.
