<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrence Walsh & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s permanent-looking Independent Counsel, is still racking up taxpayers' dollars, but the final tally is in on another of these prosecutorial pyramids. For three years, taxpayers paid to have Independent Counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexia Morrison</ENAMEX> harass former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan</ENAMEX> Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Olson</ENAMEX>. Final tab: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> $1,494,120-Olson/NNP  $861,589, for a total outlay of $2,355,709.
But we note some discrepancies. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX>'s reimbursement is just two-thirds of what his lawyers spent and about half what Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> spent. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX>, however, got paid in full. The story of how the defendant gets shorted and the prosecutor rewarded is instructive.
The special panel of judges that oversees Independent Counsel cases decides how much a defendant such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> will be allowed to pay his lawyers. Before reaching Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX>'s bottom line, the panel offered a neat synopsis of the case, which was another criminalization of policy differences by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore B. Olson</ENAMEX>, as Assistant Attorney General, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Legal Counsel</ENAMEX>, was caught up in a separation of powers contest between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the Executive Branch and subjected, by an Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counsel/NNP</ENAMEX>... to a protracted investigation into the truthfulness of his congressional testimony.''
Readers of these columns will recall how Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> agitated a Democratic House ``report'' in 1985, which charged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> with a crime for his testimony defending President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s executive privilege in a 1983 battle over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX>, now a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> constitutional lawyer, lived for years under the shadow cast by Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> until in August 1988 she announced he'd done no wrong.
Now, after all this, the compensation judges have refused Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX>'s lawyers at the firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenner</ENAMEX> & Block their full fees and expenses. The lawyers had sent Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> a bill for $1,259,072 -- well below what Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> and her staff spent. Under the Ethics in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Government Act</ENAMEX>, an unindicted target such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> is supposed to get all reasonable bills paid, on the assumption that a private citizen's financial resources are limited. But the judges decided to knock out several categories of charges, including late-payment fees of $200,000, which sounds like a reasonable amount for interest.
The inherent unfairness of the process is especially apparent to us after seeing a copy of the $1.4 million in detailed billings Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> submitted, not to the judges, but to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, which promptly paid -- no questions asked.
The judges decided not to reimburse Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> for ``librarians, clerical personnel and other support staff,'' but the records show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> paid Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> in the tens of thousands of dollars for entries including ``administrative services'' and ``other contractual services not classified.''
While the judges forbade reimbursement for the Olson lawyers' ``secretarial overtime'' or ``overtime dinner expense,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>'s bureaucrats reimbursed Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> for ``overtime pay,'' ``overtime utilities'' and ``subsistence and per diem allowance.'' Despite the supposed temporary nature of Independent Counsel work, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison</ENAMEX> was even paid for ``contributions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Employees' Life and Health Insurance Funds.</ENAMEX>''
The lesson here is clear: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers</ENAMEX> may well refuse to defend any executive-branch official under Independent Counsel investigation, since they're on notice that they'll lose 20% of their fees off the top, yet face a prosecutor with a virtually blank checkbook.
