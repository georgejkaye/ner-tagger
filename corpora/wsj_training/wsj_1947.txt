(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOM</ENAMEX> KIPPUR WAR, WHEN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EGYPT</ENAMEX> CRASHED into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> on Oct. 6, 1973, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, lasted barely a month. But one far-afield effect is still with us.
The Arab states, always bitterly resentful of U.S. support toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>, realized they held an irresistable weapon -- oil. Early in October, six Arab nations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> jacked up prices sharply. On Oct. 22, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, the world's largest exporter, they embargoed oil shipments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s staunchest European ally.
The timing was perfect. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arabs</ENAMEX> had tried embargos before. In 1956, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> invaded <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX> to seize the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suez</ENAMEX> Canal, Arab producers cut off supplies to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> simply pumped harder.
U.S. oil supplies, however, had peaked in 1970 and 1971 and by 1973 were declining. Imports, then six million barrels a day, came primarily from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venezuela</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> supplies were growing in importance. By 1973, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> was bringing in two million barrels of Arab oil a day, more than 10% of the 17.3 million barrels consumed daily.
Politics and economics conspired. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, far more dependent on Mideast oil than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, wouldn't offend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabs</ENAMEX> or trade off their precious supplies. The U.S. did manage to supply the Dutch with oil by relabeling supplies; once oil is shipped, no one can tell its source.
But car-happy Americans panicked, and so did the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other oil-consuming governments. ``Shortage'' and ``crisis'' became buzz words, although neither really applied. The spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of confusion (much of it in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>), though that was cold comfort for drivers waiting in mile-long lines at the gas pumps.
The embargo lasted only six months, but the price hikes became a fact of life. What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabs</ENAMEX> started, inflation finished. Once and for all, $5-a-barrel crude oil and 35-cents-a-gallon gasoline were history.
