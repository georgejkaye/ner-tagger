<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell Communication Corp.</ENAMEX> moved to increase its growing role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> textbook market by agreeing to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell & Howell Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Publishing</ENAMEX> unit for $260 million.
The purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merrill</ENAMEX>, an old name in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> elementary and secondary school publishing, would further strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX>'s position in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> textbook publishing through its U.S. unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan Inc.</ENAMEX> A recently formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX> joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcgraw-Hill Inc.</ENAMEX> is already the second-biggest publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> textbooks, after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.</ENAMEX>
The purchase price, at least twice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s expected sales this year, reflects the continuing allure of U.S. educational publishers, analysts said. Since about 1985, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> elementary school enrollment has been rising. That demographic trend, expected to continue into the late 1990s, is increasing school book sales across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and perking up a once-dull niche of publishing. This year, publishers' sales to elementary and secondary schools are expected to rise at least 11% from last year's $1.78 billion, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based industry analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kendrick Noble</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>
``The schools area {of publishing} is assured good growth into the 1990s,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noble</ENAMEX> said. Such expectations have already prompted a series of industry mergers, as publishers jockey for position. Besides the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan/Mcgraw</ENAMEX> venture, announced last May, other industry mergers have included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX>'s 1986 purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Foresman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX>'s textbook unit.
Since 1986, analysts say, the sales prices for these and other educational publishers have ranged from 2.2 to 2.9 times revenue -- a figure comparable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s sales multiple.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Reilly</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell's Macmillan</ENAMEX>, called the $260 million purchase ``reasonable for a company'' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s strengths in science, health, and mathematics texts -- three areas of ``weakness'' for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan/Mcgraw-Hill</ENAMEX> venture. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reilly</ENAMEX> said he expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s sales to exceed $125 million in the fiscal year ending March 31. About 70% of that, he said, represents sales to elementary and secondary schools, while the remainder stems from college text sales.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reilly</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s elementary and secondary school business would be merged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan/Mcgraw-Hill</ENAMEX> venture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s college text business is to be consolidated into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX>'s own college unit, he said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reilly</ENAMEX> added that he believes the purchase would make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan/Mcgraw-Hill</ENAMEX> the biggest U.S. textbook publisher, with combined sales of $550 million. But some industry analysts disputed that claim. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP Report</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">White Plains</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, trade publication, estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s educational book sales last year at $643 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell & Howell</ENAMEX>, a publishing and information services concern based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skokie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, was acquired last year for $678.4 million by an investor group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Bass</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bass</ENAMEX> spokesmen declined to discuss details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> sale.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Herb</ENAMEX>, corporate vice president for administration at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell & Howell</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> posted revenue last year of about $100 million. Though profitable, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herb</ENAMEX> said, with the overall consolidation going on in the publishing industry a $100 million company would find it more and more difficult to compete and be cost effective. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell & Howell</ENAMEX> has tried unsuccessfully for several years to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> by acquiring other companies. When that proved unsuccessful, it decided to sell.
``It just came down to a numbers game,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herb</ENAMEX>. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell & Howell</ENAMEX> has owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> for more than 20 years.
