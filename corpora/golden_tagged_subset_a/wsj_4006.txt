(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
BANK ADS USED TO BOAST SLOGANS like ``you have a friend at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan.</ENAMEX>'' Today, your friend at the bank is as likely to be a machine as a human being. At last count, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> banks had installed almost 82,000 automatic teller machines. The world-wide total is 250,000.
The first banking robot arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> in 1968, a one-way cash dispenser for first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Bank</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> put in a similar machine in 1969 and the same year <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citizens & Southern</ENAMEX> installed a two-way electronic teller. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First National</ENAMEX> built 100 Atms into the walls of its branches in the early'70s and began touting 24-hour service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> joined the parade in 1977, with a pair of robots in the vestibules of its 270 branches.
The mid-1970s saw the ATM starting to boom. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diebold</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, safe builder, had started building Atms in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> in 1968 and now claims 46% of that market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCR</ENAMEX> added its weight in 1973 and says it is the world leader, with a 23% global market share.
Promotion played a major role. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First National</ENAMEX> (now owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wachovia</ENAMEX>) began touting ``Tillie the All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> Teller'' in 1975. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> competed in pushing their electronic bankers.
Networks that let one bank's cardholders plug into Atms at others also pushed usage. The net could cover a city (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Citibank</ENAMEX>), a state (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX>, with 1,400 Atms) or the whole country (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mastercard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cirrus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plus</ENAMEX>). Stores like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safeway</ENAMEX> and 7-11 and companies like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> built their own networks.
As ATM transactions ballooned from 400,000 in 1975 to more than four billion by 1987, costs dropped. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Booz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allen & Hamilton</ENAMEX> found that one ATM transaction, $1.25 in 1975, cost about 37 cents in 1983, matching the average for the 42,000 transactions a human teller makes in a year.
But you can still find a friend at the bank. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> now has 1,200 Atms -- and 1,500 human tellers.
