The British government cleared Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s # 13.35 billion ($21.14 billion) bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> but reserved the right to reconsider if there is a ``material change'' in the bid.
The expected decision not to refer the all-paper, highly leveraged bid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> for a three-month investigation is evidence the British government doesn't view leverage alone in takeovers as worrisome to the economy.
Ignoring requests by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> and its political allies that the bid's partial junk-bond financing should be studied, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Ridley</ENAMEX> said ``a referral {for investigation} is based on whether competition would be affected.'' The offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>, an investment company, for the tobacco, financial services, paper and retailing giant doesn't pose antitrust problems, he said.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ridley</ENAMEX> left the government room to reconsider if Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> and his allies, including British financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Rothschild</ENAMEX> and Australian businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry Packer</ENAMEX>, restructure the bid, saying such action might be warranted if there is ``a material change in terms or other material facts.''
That caveat reflects last week's decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s Takeover Panel to allow Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> to make a new offer within 21 days of getting U.S. insurance regulators' approval for a change in control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> insurance unit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> isn't expected to overturn the Takeover Panel's decision in an appeal scheduled for next week.
Because a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> bid probably would be substantially restructured -- probably to include a cash portion and possibly to sell some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> businesses -- the government wants the option of re-examining the transaction. ``The government is giving itself some leeway,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernie Mcknight</ENAMEX>, an executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Amicable Investment Managers</ENAMEX>, a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> holder. But he and other institutional holders don't expect the government to kill the transaction.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s stock exchange yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares rose 14 pence to close at 827 pence ($13.10).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> said it regretted the government decision, which was welcomed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> said the government missed an opportunity ``to establish a coherent policy on the controversial question of highly leveraged bids... with their negative potential for the markets, for companies and for small shareholders.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Sheehy</ENAMEX>, said the company is reviewing ``suitable measures to provide a sustainable increase in shareholder value.'' Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> bid was launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, institutional holders have pressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> to consider asset sales, a recapitalization and other restructuring plans.
