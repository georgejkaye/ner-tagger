One day last March, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> Sports President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Pilson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olympics</ENAMEX> superagent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Frank</ENAMEX> met for lunch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotos Club</ENAMEX> here. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> that Olympics officials wanted $290 million or more for TV rights to the 1994 Winter Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> official said that price sounded fine.
At that price, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> was the only player at the table when negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Olympic Committee</ENAMEX> started in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> Aug. 23. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Pound</ENAMEX>, a committee member, began by disclosing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> had refused to even bid. Then, he asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> to raise his offer anyway: ``If we can have a number that starts with a three, you can have a dea.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> and his team huddled in a hallway and took just 10 minutes to return with a $300 million offer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pound</ENAMEX> responded, ``It's a deal.'' A beaming Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX>'s rivals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> grimaced at the price. How could CBS get pushed into outbidding itself? Well, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>, mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out, wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights, a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid.
``The price of poker has gone up,'' crows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles M. Neinas</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Football Association</ENAMEX>'s executive director.
With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> on a spending spree that may top $2.5 billion for four years of major sports events, the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> also risk losses if they outbid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> for other contracts.
While rights fees head skyward, ad rates won't. Advertisers already are balking at higher prices. ``The networks are paying too much for rights,'' warns adman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Isacsson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>. ``If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs, they're likely to lose all but a few who need sports, above all.''
Viewers may not be cheering, either. Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials. At the same time, some sports events will move off ``free'' television and onto cable or pay-cable, where half the nation's TV homes can't see them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids -- that is, can the network alone make a profit on it? Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press, contented affiliate stations, enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> programs when the game is over. The billion-dollar question is, How much are those benefits worth?
Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do, they won't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> could run up. ``As we've seen in the'80s,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Werner</ENAMEX>, the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPN</ENAMEX> sports channel, ``those deals can turn sour if the numbers don't work. And three years later, in a sea of red ink, the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> pursues top sports ``to belie the fact that they aren't supporting affiliates, viewers and advertisers,'' charges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas H. Wyman</ENAMEX>, who was ousted as chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence A. Tisch</ENAMEX> bought a 24.9% stake in the company and took over three years ago. ``They lost the entertainment crown, and they needed one. And they've bought one.''
On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> bid a total of $1.64 billion. That's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> were willing to pay. (After 1992, the winter and summer Olympics will be held two years apart, with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996.)
Now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> -- a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs ``a level offocus and intellectual attention'' similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness. Next month, talks will begin on two coveted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> contracts, for the pro and college basketball finals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them. The potential bill: more than $600 million for several seasons, an 80% jump. A few months later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s college and pro football contracts come up for renewal; they could go for close to $100 million more than CBS now pays, a 40% to 50% rise.
``What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lund</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> Sports president now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multimedia Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. William Grimes</ENAMEX>, former president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPN</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> may ``come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> and say,'We'We can overbid, too.' And the winners will be the colleges, not either network. Nor, by the way, advertisers.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is an unlikely big spender. In the mid-1980s, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> had just bid a record $309 million for the 1988 Winter Games, he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices. ``I love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX>, but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wussler</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> Sports president. ``And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today.'' Rivals carp at ``the principle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX>,'' as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Watson</ENAMEX> once put it -- ``he's always expounding that rights are too high, then he's going crazy.''
But the 49-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is hardly a man to ignore the numbers. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> law school graduate, he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metromedia Inc.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Morris</ENAMEX> talent agency. In 1976, he joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> Sports to head business affairs and, five years later, became its president.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says that when he spoke out a few years ago, ``I didn't say forever, and I didn't say every property.'' The market changed, he adds. And he isn't the only big spender: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> will pay a record $401 million for the 1992 Summer Games, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPN</ENAMEX>, 80%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC</ENAMEX>, will shell out $400 million for four years of baseball, airing 175 regular-season games a year.
``Our competitors say we overbid them. Who cares? Maybe we recognize values the other guys don't,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX>'s ``Major Events'' strategy jelled after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took over. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> recalls that in April 1986, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s annual meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took the 90-minute train ride back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX>, a billionaire in hotels and finance, was just learning the TV business. Five months later, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> took over as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s chief executive, and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper, sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators.
Then, in May 1988, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> gave him one: He bid $243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albertville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> wouldn't bid even $200 million. That started the still-raging bidding wars.
The ``Major Events'' strategy, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says, is designed to notch a place for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s. It's also a fast fix for an ailing image. He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vcrs</ENAMEX>, grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later. Next October, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>, for the first time, won't have to start the season against the much-watched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American and National</ENAMEX> baseball league championships and the World Series.
``I've been struggling against that for years,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Rodgers</ENAMEX>, who runs WBBM-TV, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>-owned station in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. Even if baseball triggers losses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> -- and he doesn't think it will -- ``I'd rather see the games on our air than on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>,'' he says.
That isn't surprising. Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years, and premiering new shows is ``a crap shoot,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says. But top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences 30% or 40% larger than those CBS usually gets.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> says baseball and the Olympics may help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> move up to No. 2 in the household ratings race, putting pizazz back into the network's image. And the Winter Olympics will air during the February ``sweeps,'' when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations.
That will please once-grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilson</ENAMEX> plan. They gleefully await the ``dream season'' in 1990. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will air the Super Bowl, baseball playoffs, college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events. ``It's made me more committed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip A. Jones</ENAMEX>, the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith Corp.</ENAMEX>'s broadcast group, which has two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> affiliates.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success, however. No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak. ``In this market of 40 channels, sophisticated viewers and the remote control, trial isn't a guarantee of anything,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPN</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werner</ENAMEX> says. ``If the show ain't a killer, they're gone.''
During the 1984 Summer Games, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> touted ``Call to Glory,'' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks. Last October, during the 1988 Summer Games, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> relentlessly pitched a new series, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tattingers.</ENAMEX>'' It belly-flopped anyway.
Moreover, sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> might move up to No. 2 in household ratings, most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> may remain a distant No. 3 in that regard.
Nor is CBS a shoo-in to get blockbuster ratings. In recent years, the World Series and the Olympics were aired against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s last-place lineup. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will put the athletes up against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cosby</ENAMEX>, ``Cheers'' and other shows in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s No. 1 schedule.
Even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited. The sports lineup may add only 1% to 5% to a station's annual profits. It alone isn't likely to stop a station from dumping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> shows. ``The World Series, seven nights, wasn't enough of an incentive,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Klinsky</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WHEC</ENAMEX>-TV in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, which dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> six weeks ago. ``You've got to judge where the network will be in three years.''
The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> can't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself. And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort. On the $1.06 billion baseball agreement alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> is likely to lose $250 million in four years, contends Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wussler</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> man, now at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat Inc.</ENAMEX> Nevertheless, he deems the deal ``plain smart'' for its huge promotional value.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> calls that loss estimate ``wildly inaccurate,'' conceding only that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will lose money on baseball in the first year. ``It's too early to tell'' what happens after that, he says. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tisch</ENAMEX> expects losses in all four years of the contract, he told U.S. senators last June.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will pay an average of $82 million more each year than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> had paid together -- and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will air only 12 regular-season games, 26 fewer than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>. That has outraged some fans. It also indicates a $50 million drop in ad sales for regular-season games -- a risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> took to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games. If the playoffs end in four-game sweeps, losses could soar.
Advertisers are resisting higher prices, which would help close the gap. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> signed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four years. Price: $265 million. But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 -- 17% less than what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> is charging for the Series this month. Moreover, ``there's no question ad rates will come down considerably'' from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> price, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Chase</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bozell Inc.</ENAMEX> Other admen, however, say rates could rise later if ad spending surges.
The Winter Games outlook also is mixed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> expects to make modest profits, but rivals contend that it will take a beating. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> lost $75 million on the 1988 Winter Games, partly because of its $309 million rights fee. It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calgary</ENAMEX> -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will add 25 1/2 hours to that load in 1992, and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events. All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norway</ENAMEX>, so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> will pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> $25 million to air 50 hours of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> coverage plus 50 hours of additional events.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Frank</ENAMEX>, the agent who took Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> to lunch last March, says that even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> loses, say, $10 million, it matters little. ``Ten million ain't jack, man, when you got $3 billion sitting in the bank,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>, senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Management Group</ENAMEX>, citing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses. ``It doesn't mean anything -- it's public-relations money.''
Moreover, sports has ``claimed its place'' as a guaranteed ratings-getter, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David J. Stern</ENAMEX>, the commissioner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Basketball Association</ENAMEX>. ``This isn't outlandish bidding; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it.... I would tend to trust their judgment.''
That's easy for him to say: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s four-year NBA pact, now at $176 million for four years, could double in price by the time his talks with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> are completed later this month. That would cut into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s slim margin for profit -- and error. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Sports</ENAMEX> earned $50 million or so last year. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> takes in the least money in prime time; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> charge 30% to 35% more for ads, according to a Variety survey.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s costs are huge, and the risks go up with each new sports package that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> locks  up. Although sports officials predict jumps of 50% to 100% in the major contracts coming up for renewal, ad rates may rise only 20%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time. But the savings will be minuscule. Each hour of Olympics and baseball in prime time will cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> $2.6 million to $2.8 million; an hour-long drama costs only $900,000, and it is aired twice.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> may cushion losses with about $200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> and other businesses. But media-stock analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J. Macdonald</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macdonald Grippo Riely</ENAMEX> says Wall Street won't take kindly to that. ``On a stand-alone basis, the network ought to make money,'' he says.
When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilson</ENAMEX> is asked directly -- can you make money on all this? -- he doesn't exactly say yes. ``What you're really asking is, Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management?'' he says. Then, he answers his own question. ``Yes, they are. That's the only question we need to address.
