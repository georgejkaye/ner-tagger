<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon Inc.</ENAMEX> was sued by 16 current and former employees claiming that the company and its top executives misused an employee stock ownership plan.
The suit, which seeks an estimated $150 million in damages, claims that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX>'s assets were used for personal gain by company executives and that the fund may now be worth nothing. In addition to the company, the other defendants in the suit are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Maloney Jr.</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive officer; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Ronald Morgan</ENAMEX>, current chairman and chief executive; and seven other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon</ENAMEX> executives. All the company executives named as defendants were also trustees of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX>, the suit says.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, also accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers & Lybrand</ENAMEX>, the accounting firm for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon</ENAMEX>, of negligence in its handling of financial statements for the company and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon</ENAMEX> is a financial services company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald G. Mccabe</ENAMEX>, counsel for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon</ENAMEX>, said that the lawsuit is ``without merit'' and that the defendants deny all allegations. He said the company will file a response to the charges after it has reviewed the suit.
An attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers & Lybrand</ENAMEX> said the company hasn't seen the suit and can't comment.
The suit seeks to be made a class action on behalf of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon</ENAMEX> employees who participated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ESOP</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX> held about 77% of the stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon</ENAMEX> and was part of the plaintiffs' regular compensation, the suit said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Taylor Isquith</ENAMEX>, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX> was a ``major selling point in recruiting people'' to work as brokers for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon</ENAMEX>. He said most of the plaintiffs had stakes valued at more than $100,000 each in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ESOP</ENAMEX>.
The lawsuit said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX>'s assets were valued at $140 million in 1986 and $125 million in 1987. But the company didn't report the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX> in 1988, the lawsuit said, and in July 1989 a letter was sent to employees stating that ``it is possible {that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX>} will have no value whatsoever.''
Among other things, the suit says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX> assets were improperly used to provide interest-free loans to executives and directors, to buy and operate a $1.3 million yacht used for the defendants' personal entertainment, and to maintain luxury apartments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> for the defendants' personal use.
