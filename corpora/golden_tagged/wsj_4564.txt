<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Pontiac division said it plans to boost its total vehicle sales by about 6% in the 1990 model year, mainly because of sales of a new plastic-bodied minivan.
But Pontiac officials also conceded that they expect sales of their primary midsized car line, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prix</ENAMEX>, won't be enough to assure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> plant exclusively dedicated to the model will work at full capacity in the 1990 model year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX>'s modest expectations for the Grand Prix, one of four lines <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> designed as part of its $5 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-10 midsized car program, is another sign that despite the recent announcement that the company will indefinitely idle a plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakewood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has a long way to go to solve its costly overcapacity problem.
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> rose to $48.25, up $1.125.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> officials said during a new model preview yesterday that they expect total Grand Prix sales will be about 175,000 vehicles in the 1990 model year. Of that total, about 70,000 should be new sedan models, division general sales and service manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.M. Schlesinger</ENAMEX> said. Sales of the two-year-old Grand Prix coupe, however, will fall to 105,000 vehicles in 1990 from about 118,000 cars in the 1989 model year that ends Sept. 30, Pontiac officials predicted.
But the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairfax</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>, plant that builds the Grand Prix line is capable of producing more than 250,000 cars a year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s Oldsmobile division also has predicted that 1990 sales of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-10 car, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme</ENAMEX>, won't be enough to utilize the full capacity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Doraville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>, plant dedicated to that car.
Overall, Pontiac projected it would sell about 780,000 vehicles, up from 735,000 in the 1989 model year. But most of that increase is expected to come from sales of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans Sport minivan</ENAMEX>, which actually will be classified as a truck for safety and environmental purposes, Pontiac officials said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans Sport</ENAMEX> sales could amount to between 40,000 and 60,000 vehicles, depending on production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tarrytown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, factory that assembles the vans. Pontiac is sharing the plant's output with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> and Oldsmobile divisions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> officials said they expect the division's passenger car sales will rise slightly to about 745,000 vehicles, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX>'s share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> car market will increase to 7.5% in the 1990 model year, up from 7.2% in the current model year.
