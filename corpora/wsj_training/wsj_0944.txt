Two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography. These decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars, and from journalists as well.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Miller</ENAMEX>'s ``Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Ron Hubbard</ENAMEX>'' is a biography of the founder of the Church of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scientology</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX>, who died in 1986, bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church, which licensed them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Era Publications</ENAMEX>, a Danish corporation. In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction to restrain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry Holt & Co.</ENAMEX> from publishing ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' on the ground that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s quotations from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX> infringed the copyrights. The publisher argued in response that the ``fair use'' statute permits quotation ``for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,... scholarship, or research.''
District Court Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Leval</ENAMEX> denied the injunction on the ground that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Era</ENAMEX> had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine lawyers call ``laches.'' As for the merits, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> had written ``a serious book of responsible historical criticism.'' Verbatim quotation, the judge believed, was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX> -- mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX>'s own words. ``The biographer\,'' Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> wrote, ``should not be required simply to express... conclusions without defending them by example.'' In such circumstances, free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner.
But Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> felt constrained by an earlier decision of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Circuit Court</ENAMEX> forbidding a biographer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.D. Salinger</ENAMEX> to quote from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX>'s personal letters. He distinguished the two cases: In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX>, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> noted, the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject. Still the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s quotations from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX>'s unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright. But the proper remedy, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> said, lay in a suit for damages, not in an injunction.
The case went on appeal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Circuit.</ENAMEX> In a decision in April of this year, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Miner</ENAMEX>, joined by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Altimari</ENAMEX>, agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' was a serious work but rejected Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX>'s argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright. ``We conclude,'' the two judges wrote, ``that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction.'' Had the suit been filed in time, they said, ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' would have been suppressed.
This was too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oakes</ENAMEX>, the court's chief judge. In a powerful separate opinion, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> further distinguished the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> case by pointing out that a living person, like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX>, had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man, like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubbard</ENAMEX>. ``I thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinger</ENAMEX> might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us. This case realizes that concern.''
Decisions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Second Circuit</ENAMEX> itself, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> continued, had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use. And the injunction <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judges Miner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Altimari</ENAMEX> would so readily have granted had New Era sued in time? Suppression of the book, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> observed, would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the First Amendment.
Moreover, and here Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> went to the heart of the question, ``Responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources, letters, diaries, and memoranda. Indeed, it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information.''
Now, scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation. And of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers, whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries. But in the ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' case the author found most of his material in court records or via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom of Information Act</ENAMEX>. And when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials, copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points.
Judges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leval</ENAMEX> understand the requirements of historical scholarship. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judges Miner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Altimari</ENAMEX> do not appear to have a clue. Yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law. As matters stand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> ruling, torn from context and broadly construed, is controlling. If an author quotes ``more than minimal amounts'' of unpublished copyrighted materials, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinger</ENAMEX> decision had it, ``he deserves to be enjoined.'' The courts have not defined ``minimal amounts,'' but publishers, I understand, take it to mean about 50 words. The ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise. A second decision, handed down in August by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ninth Circuit</ENAMEX>, is another blow against scholarship. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Malcolm</ENAMEX>, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX>, later published in book form by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX> under the title ``In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud Archives.</ENAMEX>'' The articles were largely based on interviews Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> had taped with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Masson</ENAMEX>, a psychoanalyst who had served as projects director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freud Archives.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> then brought a libel suit against Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>. As a public figure, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> had to prove malice and, as proof of malice, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> were in fact fabricated. The quotes could not be found on the tapes, and the two judges who decided the case for Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> and her publishers conceded that, for the purpose of their decision, ``we assume the quotations were deliberately altered.''
For all historians and most journalists, this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> articles. But Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Alarcon</ENAMEX>, joined by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Holcomb Hall</ENAMEX>, took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks.
In his eloquent dissent, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kozinski</ENAMEX> observed that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said, the reader assumes that these are the speaker's precise words or at least his words purged of ``uh'' and ``you know'' and grammatical error. While judges have an obligation under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the press, ``the right to deliberately alter quotations is not, in my view, a concomitant of a free press.''
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>, for example, wrote that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> described himself as ``the greatest analyst who ever lived.'' No such statement appears on the tapes. The majority cited Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX>'s remark ``It's me alone... against the rest of the analytic world'' as warrant for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> fabrication. But, as Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozinski</ENAMEX> noted, the context shows that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX>'s ``me alone'' remark referred not to his alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> had Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> describing himself as ``an intellectual gigolo.'' Again, no such statement appears on the tapes. The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX>'s description of himself as a ``private asset but a public liability'' to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Freud</ENAMEX> and that in any case it was not defamatory. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozinski</ENAMEX> found the derivation entirely strained and writes that ``for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is... a devastating admission of professional dishonesty.''
These were only two of a series of fabrications that had, in Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozinski</ENAMEX>'s words, the cumulative effect of making Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> ``appear more arrogant, less sensitive, shallower, more self-aggrandizing, and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements.'' As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Coles</ENAMEX> wrote in a review of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX>'s book, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> emerges ``as a grandiose egotist... and, in the end, a self-destructive fool. But it is not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Malcolm</ENAMEX> who calls him such: his own words reveal this psychological profile.'' We now know that the words were not always his own.
``There is one sacred rule of journalism,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hersey</ENAMEX> has said. ``The writer must not invent.'' Should the green light Judges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alarcon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice, it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians -- and for citizens. As Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kozinski</ENAMEX> put it: ``To invoke the right to deliberately distort what someone else has said is to assert the right to lie in print.... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masson</ENAMEX> has lost his case, but the defendants, and the profession to which they belong, have lost far more.''
The historical profession will survive these decisions. Perhaps in time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will correct them. But writing history is tough enough without judges gratuitously throwing obstacles in the scholar's path.
