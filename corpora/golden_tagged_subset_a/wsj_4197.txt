<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> leaders who tried to stop a capital-gains tax cut by replacing it with an expansion of the individual retirement account deduction now face the prospect of getting both.
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> has included an enhanced IRA proposal in a package of tax changes that he intends to present to the panel today. The package would raise more than $5.4 billion in fiscal 1990 without increasing the top individual tax rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> members who saw the package late last week generally approved of it, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> proposal in particular was greeted enthusiastically.
Capital gains, however, remain the major unresolved issue. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Democrat</ENAMEX>'s package doesn't contain a capital gains component, but behind-the-scenes pressure has been intense to add a provision that cuts that tax rate. The 20-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Committee</ENAMEX> is evenly split on the question, but a majority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> appears to favor some sort of capital gains tax reduction.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> said he expects drafting of his tax plan to be ``difficult.''
Last week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> approved a gains-tax cut over the objections of its Democratic leaders. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, the next stop for the legislation, Democratic leaders again are opposed. But as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> has a sizable minority of Democrats and near-solid block of Republicans who favor some sort of reduction, which has been a priority of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>'s ``Meet the Press'' yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>) declared that the capital-gains plan approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> ``will not be enacted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.'' But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> for the first time acknowledged that a capital-gains proposal could pass the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. He said the outcome of any alternative proposal ``will depend on the nature of the plan, and I think the vote there will be very close.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> plan would cut the capital gains tax rate for 2 1/2 years to 19.6% from the current maximum of 33%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afterward</ENAMEX>, the rate would be 28%, with gains from newly acquired assets indexed to inflation.
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> debated its capital gains provision, several Democratic senators met in the office of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Graham</ENAMEX> to discuss their common interest in cutting the capital gains tax rate. Since then, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okla.</ENAMEX>), a conservative member of the tax-writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Committee</ENAMEX>, has undertaken the chore of devising a plan that meets their widely varied interests.
On Friday, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> told a meeting of the Democratic committee members that he intends to offer an amendment to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX>'s proposal that would reduce the capital gains rate. ``We've got to come up with something that accepts the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> proposal, but also does something on capital gains,'' he said afterward.
In an interview, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> said he dislikes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> version of the capital gains cut, which would produce a ``fire sale of assets'' by reducing the rate for 2 1/2 years and then increasing it. He said he favors a permanent tax cut that helps start-up companies and encourages long-term investment. He spoke highly of plans that remove from taxation gains that are attributable to inflation and that mostly benefit newly acquired assets. His biggest challenge, he said, is financing the proposal.
The proponents of a gains-tax cut Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> hopes to satisfy are a diverse lot, ranging from liberal Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kerry</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, who represent states with high-technology industries, to Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, whose states have large timber interests. High-tech companies need capital, while timber sales would receive the preferential tax treatment of capital gains. Freshmen senators such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Robb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Lieberman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> also have expressed interest.
All told, perhaps 15 Democratic senators favor a cut in the capital gains tax, more than enough to produce a majority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, which has 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans.
Still, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> holds out the hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> amendment on capital gains could fail narrowly in his committee, and that his package could be sent to the floor without much change. Once there, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> rules might make it hard to add a capital-gains proposal. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> argues that it would be too costly to approve both a capital gains tax cut and an enhanced IRA deduction. His plan would give a 50% deduction for up to $2,000 of IRA contributions made by people who currently don't qualify. It also would allow penalty-free withdrawals for retirement, higher education or the purchase of a first home.
As a possible fallback position, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> is watching efforts by committee member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Pryor</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ark.</ENAMEX>). Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pryor</ENAMEX>, with leadership encouragement, is trying to see what, short of a capital gains tax cut, is acceptable to fellow timber-state senators. So far, he has come up with income averaging, a plan that would spread gains over a number of years. But it isn't clear that the plan would help fledgling high-tech companies.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> to go beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> proposal and approve a permanent capital-gains differential. He also said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> proposal was ``too expensive at a time when reaching Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets is our first concern.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX>'s comments Friday about Iras came only 2 1/2 weeks after he announced that a team of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> officials was studying ways to bolster the nation's savings rate through tax incentives, including new deductions for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iras</ENAMEX>. He retreated from his earlier remarks, saying ``there is no firm consensus over whether Iras'' are effective in stimulating savings.
