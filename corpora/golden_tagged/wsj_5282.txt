<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex Corp.</ENAMEX> announced a series of agreements under which the biotechnology company will reacquire the right to manufacture and market promising biological agents for treatment of cancer and immune dysfunction.
Among product rights reacquired was granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSF</ENAMEX>, which promotes growth of infection-fighting white blood cells. In a recent study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSF</ENAMEX> reduced deaths following bone-marrow transplants in cancer patients. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> plans to file an application for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSF</ENAMEX> for this use late this year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX>, which in the early 1980s licensed away the right to make and sell products it had developed, now has shifted gears and is reclaiming rights to such products as part of its strategy of becoming ``a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen A. Duzan</ENAMEX>, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Under the first of several related agreements, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Drug Inc.</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> to restructure a joint venture. Under terms of the pact Immunex paid nearly $5 million for the rights to market and manufacture interleukin-1 receptor, interleukin-4 receptor, and B-cell differentiation factor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> said the payment will be made out of cash reserves during the third quarter.
The experimental agents generally are thought to have potential for controlling various aspects of the human immune response, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> said. Sterling, for its part, received rights to certain so-called rational drug design projects and other product development projects.
In a related move, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> said it acquired from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behringwerke AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> the manufacturing and co-marketing rights to certain colony stimulating factors, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSF</ENAMEX>, and interleukin-3. In return, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behringwerke</ENAMEX> received rights to certain Immunex receptor products outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behringwerke</ENAMEX> also received an option to manufacture and market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> the receptor products. If exercised, these rights would require Behringwerke to pay a license fee, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> said would offset its payment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s Sterling unit.
