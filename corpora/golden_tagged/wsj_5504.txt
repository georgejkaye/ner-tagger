The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s Cup rightfully belongs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> Yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York state</ENAMEX> appeals court ruled. The court reversed a lower court decision that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> club unfairly won the prize in 1988.
In a 4-1 decision, the appeals court found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> club properly fulfilled its obligations under the rules of the yacht race when it defeated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury Bay Boating Club</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX>. Earlier this year, a lower court ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> club violated the spirit of the 132-year-old international competition by using a catamaran to defeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> club's 90-foot monohull. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> Bay claimed that the rules required the defender use a boat similar in size to that of the challenger.
But the appeals court said the contest places no such restrictions of the defender of the trophy. ``The Deed of Gift {which established the rules of the contest} is silent as to the type of boat to be used by the defender.... In finding that the vessels must be'somewhat  evenly matched,' the {lower} court promulgated a rule that is neither expressed in, nor inferable from, the language of the Deed of Gift,'' the appeals court said in its decision.
A lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury Bay</ENAMEX> said the ruling makes it virtually impossible for any challenger to ever take the cup. Because the rules require the challenger to announce in advance the dimensions of its vessel, the defender can always enter a boat that by its dimensions alone is likely to win, said the lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George N. Tompkins Jr</ENAMEX>. He said that in the past, the challenger and defender mutually agreed to certain limitations on the size and type of vessels.
``If this decision stands, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s Cup might as well be renamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> Cup because that's where it will always stay,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tompkins</ENAMEX>. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury Bay</ENAMEX> plans to appeal the decision to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albany</ENAMEX>, the state's highest court.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> club's attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold R. Tyler Jr.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Patterson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belknap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Webb</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tyler</ENAMEX>, said he was especially pleased that the appeals panel indicated it is inappropriate for disputes over sporting events to be resolved in court. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mercury Bay</ENAMEX> could have protested <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>'s use of the catamaran before an international committee of yachting officials. He also challenged whether <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>'s choice of boats was inherently unfair: ``It would have been very unfair to the catamaran if wind and sea conditions had been a bit different last year.''
In a dissenting opinion, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentley Kassal</ENAMEX> said, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1988 America</ENAMEX>'s Cup races were manifestly unfair in every sense.'' He said the tradition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s Cup ``has long dictated that participants maintain a sense of fair play and engage in honest rivalry. These principles were violated when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> Yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> entered a catamaran, thereby pitting a multihulled vessel against a monohull for the first time in the 130 years of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s Cup competition.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MARCUS SCHLOSS & Co.</ENAMEX> raises double-jeopardy issue in motion to dismiss guilty verdict.
The Wall Street securities firm is challenging the government's right to assess criminal penalties on the heels of civil penalties involving the same allegedly illicit conduct.
In a post-trial motion filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> federal court, lawyers for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Schloss</ENAMEX> -- which was convicted in July of conspiracy and securities fraud -- are using a double-jeopardy argument in an effort to overturn a jury's guilty verdict on one count of securities fraud.
Double jeopardy is a Fifth Amendment protection against being tried twice for the same offense. Last May, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> said the protection applied not only to criminal proceedings, and that it prohibited especially severe civil penalties against an individual already penalized criminally for the same offense.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Schloss</ENAMEX>'s attorneys at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan & Cromwell</ENAMEX> say the clause should also apply to cases in which the defendant is assessed for civil penalties prior to criminal prosecution.
In February 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Schloss</ENAMEX> agreed to a settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, which filed a civil suit involving the same transactions the government later outlined in its indictment. The firm agreed to pay $136,900 in disgorgement of alleged illegal profits and a double civil penalty of $273,800.
Nearly $30,000 of the settlement total involved the firm's March 1986 purchase of stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Brands Inc.</ENAMEX>, the government said. Because of the verdict the firm faces a maximum penalty of $500,000 on the count involving that transaction.
In response to the motion, federal prosecutor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Loewenson Jr.</ENAMEX> wrote that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s ruling last May was limited ``to the situation in which the criminal prosecution precedes a civil action that seeks to exact further sanctions for the same conduct.''
The prosecutor stressed that if civil penalties precluded criminal penalties for the same offense, then an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> settlement could in effect be a purchase of immunity against prosecution.
In a reply filed yesterday, defense lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Schwartz</ENAMEX> argued that the double-jeopardy clause was intended to protect against the government's attempts to seek a second punishment simply because it may not have been satisfied with the first.
JUDGE ORDERS RELEASE of documents concerning exclusion of a Colombian journalist from U.S.
U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Walker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> ruled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Investigation</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> failed to provide an adequate explanation when they refused to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Lara Salive</ENAMEX>, a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombian</ENAMEX> journalist, into the U.S.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Committee</ENAMEX> for Human Rights sought the documents under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom of Information Act</ENAMEX>, which requires federal agencies to release public records upon request unless the material is exempted for national security or other reasons.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Committee</ENAMEX>, a public interest law firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, received several hundred pages of documents from the agencies. Other documents were released with deletions or withheld entirely for national security or other reasons. The committee filed suit in May 1987 seeking the withheld information.
In his ruling late last week, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> ordered the government to submit some -- but not all -- of the documents so he could review them privately.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lara</ENAMEX> was detained by agents because she was named on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lookout List</ENAMEX>,'' a listing of people barred from the U.S. on suspicion of communist or subversive beliefs. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> required the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> to identify all excluded individuals on the Lookout List by occupation, country and reason for exemption.
Assistant U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chad Vignola</ENAMEX> said the government hadn't decided whether to appeal the release of that information.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur C. Helton</ENAMEX>, a director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers Committee</ENAMEX>, said Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX>'s ruling marked the first time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> would have to disclose extensive information about people on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lookout List</ENAMEX>.
``This decision will be helpful in understanding the nature and scope of the problem,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helton</ENAMEX> said. ``We don't even know the exact numbers of people on the list.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">THACHER PROFITT</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> affiliates with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> law firm.
The federal legislation aimed at resolving the savings and loan crisis is also a matchmaker. The potential windfall in thrift-related work has prompted the affiliation of the 140-lawyer firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thacher, Profitt & Wood</ENAMEX> with 18-lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittenburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittenburg & Schachter</ENAMEX>, which has offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>.
Whittenburg represented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> in its suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenkins & Gilchrist</ENAMEX> over the firm's advice to three failed thrifts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenkins & Gilchrist</ENAMEX> agreed to settle the suit and other claims for $20 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thacher Profitt</ENAMEX>, which has a substantial banking and real-estate practice, sees its affiliation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittenburg</ENAMEX> as its entre into thrift-resolution work, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillip Broughton</ENAMEX>, chairman of the executive committee at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thacher Profitt.</ENAMEX>
The firms will share offices and some clients. An eventual merger is ``certainly a possibility,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittenburg</ENAMEX> partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Whittenburg</ENAMEX>.
A POST-TRIAL GAG ORDER ON <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JURORS</ENAMEX> IS CHALLENGED by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> newspaper. The unusual gag order was issued from the bench by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Cummings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lubbock</ENAMEX>, who presided over a six-month bank-fraud trial that ended last week with a hung jury. After declaring a mistrial, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cummings</ENAMEX> told the jurors they couldn't speak to anyone about the case and ordered them to report anyone who approached them about it. Lawyers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> Morning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">News</ENAMEX> have asked the Fifth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> to direct Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cummings</ENAMEX> to lift the gag order. ``The order in this case clearly chills the media in their attempts to gather news,'' the paper's lawyers wrote. ``The jurors, too, have First Amendment rights that the trial court's order unnecessarily abridges.
