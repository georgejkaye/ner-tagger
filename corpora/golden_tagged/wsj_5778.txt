Until now, many troubled junk-bond issuers have been able to restructure bad debt -- rather than default on it. But with the junk market in turmoil, analysts say they expect more defaults.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C. Holdings</ENAMEX> could be one of the first companies to test that thesis.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>-based developer has been on the ropes because of depressed housing markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>. Its 11 1/4% senior subordinated notes, underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> have fallen to about 35 cents on the dollar. Its stock has plummeted to 2 5/8 from a 1988 high of 6 7/8.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian E. Bogart</ENAMEX>, an analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccarthy, Crisanti & Maffei</ENAMEX>, says the company's bonds, and probably its stock, are trading too high.
In a strongly worded report, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> says the probability that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> will default or exchange its bonds, of which $256 million are outstanding, ``has risen to the highest level. The company has experienced difficulty in renewing some of its revolving {bank} credit, and we expect the situation to worsen.''
In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> asserts that with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX>'s bonds trading at such distressed levels, the bondholders would be unlikely to swap them for new paper if such a restructuring were to be proposed. ``My feeling is: They will most likely end up in bankruptcy'' proceedings, he says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer Browne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX>'s executive vice president and general counsel, disagrees. ``We've never missed a payment. We closed seven divisions and we're still building homes,'' he says, adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> is ``the only major survivor'' among <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>'s home builders. Although banks have reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX>'s credit lines, he argues that the now-smaller company doesn't need as much capital.
However, the company concedes that it has been selling homes and mortgages in its inventory, as well as other assets, to meet its expenses. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> estimates that operating cash flow will cover only 81% of this year's interest bill.
Whether it lives or dies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX>'s plight speaks volumes about how junk issuers got in trouble. Not only did its own business sour, but it took a $49.7 million write-down on investments last year -- largely from selling junk bonds issued by others.
What was M.D.C. doing with other people's junk?
In 1986 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> -- then in its heyday as a junk-bond marketer -- raised $506 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> senior subordinated notes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Sussman</ENAMEX>, chief investment officer at Far <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Savings & Loan</ENAMEX>, says, ``their strategy was'give me half a billion dollars and I'll go find places for it.' It was a big blind pool.'' When various acquisition attempts failed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> found itself overfunded and paying high interest. Looking to earn as high a yield as it was paying, it invested $200 million in third-party junk. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Garea</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette</ENAMEX>, says ``that was the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> game of a few years ago.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overfunding</ENAMEX>, he says, helped insure that buyers would be there for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s next deal.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> spokesman says ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> raised funds so they could expand in home building, and they did. They were also looking to expand into financial services. When they could'nt could'nt find a suitable company they put money into high-yield bonds.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browne</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> bought bonds from other underwriters as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curiously</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> has been helped by the fact that its own bonds fell faster than those it invested in. Although it sold third-party junk bonds at a loss, it used the proceeds to buy back its own bonds at deeper discounts and booked a $55.3 million gain last year. That move also reduced the company's interest charges. But now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX>'s bank covenants prevent it from buying back more of its bonds.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browne</ENAMEX> says ``in retrospect, we should have {borrowed less}. The company expanded very fast and used a lot of leverage.'' About 42% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C</ENAMEX>'s raw land and land under development is in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>, perhaps the worst <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> real estate market. It also has real estate in strong markets, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browne</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> is hoping to sell some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> assets. ``That would worsen the long-term earnings outlook,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX> says.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> may not have the luxury of thinking long-term. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Spirrison</ENAMEX>, a trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rodman & Renshaw</ENAMEX>, says ``it's a horse race whether they can turn the business around before they run out of cash.''
Many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX>'s bank lines mature next year, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browne</ENAMEX> predicts they will be renewed. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> recently settled charges against it by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> relating to its accounting; the company didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browne</ENAMEX> boasts that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> ``didn't take action against any official.'' Now, he says, ``We're trying to get our house in order.'' But, he adds, the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mccarthy</ENAMEX> report may be read by the company's creditors ``doesn't help.''
