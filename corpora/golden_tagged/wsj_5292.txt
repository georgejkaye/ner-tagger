In response to your Aug. 31 editorial ``Academic Protectionism,'' let me assure you that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Overseers of the Hoover Institution</ENAMEX> does not intend to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> ``to gain control of Hoover and its abundant resources.''
We will only approve a candidate for director of the institution who is fully committed to maintaining Hoover's independence and scholarly integrity -- and to ensuring Hoover's continued role as a world-class research organization dedicated to free markets, free institutions and the free exchange of ideas.
I'd also like to correct one error: The Journal reports <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover's</ENAMEX> endowment as $300 million; in fact, it is $125 million. But you are quite right to credit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Campbell</ENAMEX>'s leadership for the impressive growth of that endowment from $2 million in 1960 to $125 million today.

Some of the disappointing things to me in the past few years of my directorship of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover Institution</ENAMEX> were the intolerance and the attempts to stifle free speech, not to mention takeover attempts that developed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> campus. It is particularly ironic (then again, perhaps it is not ) that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Kennedy</ENAMEX> would allow this to take place, since the motto of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> is ``Let the winds of freedom blow.''
If President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> and the trustees do not demonstrate more fortitude in the next three or four years, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover Institution</ENAMEX> will become completely independent and still be in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> campus -- as the university needs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover Institution</ENAMEX> more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover Institution</ENAMEX> needs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stanford</ENAMEX>.
