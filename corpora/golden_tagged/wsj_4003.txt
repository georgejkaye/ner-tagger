(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAS</ENAMEX> FLARE-OFF FROM AN OIL DRILLING <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SITE</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arctic</ENAMEX> Ocean could be seen by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaskan</ENAMEX> bush pilots miles away. The event, on March 13, 1968, also marked the start of a fight between oil companies and environmentalists that continues to this day.
The long-sought oil stirke by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humble Oil & Refining</ENAMEX>, and a second nearby strike in June, confirmed an estimated field of up to 10 billion barrels -- larger even than a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> field discovered in 1930. And, briefly, it sparked a fever like the 1890s Klondike gold rush.
``There will be real problems getting the crude (oil) out, but this field can reshape the world oil picture,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.W. Keeler</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips Petroleum</ENAMEX>, one of many oil companies that bought leases in the area. Problems there were. The venturers were shipped by 50-mile-an-hour winds in the subzero winter, bogged in mud and eaten by mosquitoes in the spring and summer, and attacked by nature lovers year round.
Plans of eight oil companies for and 800-mile pipeline from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Slope</ENAMEX> to a new ice-free ocean tanker port terminal at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valdez</ENAMEX> were delayed for four years in court actions by such foes as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilderness Society</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Defense Fund</ENAMEX> and Friends of the Earth.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, voting a bill mainly sponsored by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Jackson</ENAMEX>, finally cleared the project in November 1973. It was completed on June 20, 1977, at a cost of $7.7 billion -- six years behind scedule and $6.8 billion costlier. Its features included 550 pipeline crossings for migrating caribou.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>'s more than one million barrels a day shaved <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> reliance on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> oil. But the troubles did'nt did'nt  end. On March 24, 1989, an offcourse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> tanker struck an underwater reef in Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sound</ENAMEX> and spilled nerly 11 million barrels of crude. On Sept. 15, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>, despite Alaskan protests, halted its cleanup of fouled beaches for the winter.
