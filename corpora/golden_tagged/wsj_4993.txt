<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint Corp.</ENAMEX>, in the midst of a power struggle for control of its board, said it had a net loss of $8.9 million in the fourth quarter ended July 29, against year-earlier net income of $2.6 million, or two cents a share.
The fourth-quarter loss, combined with an even-larger third-period deficit, resulted in a loss for fiscal 1989 of $29.2 million, against year-ago net of $8 million. Preferred-dividend requirements exceeded fiscal 1988's net.
Fourth-quarter revenue was $79 million, down 10.3% from the prior year's $88.1 million. For all of fiscal 1989, revenue totaled $312.5 million, down 5.5% from $330.8 million a year earlier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Ackerman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> attorney who is seeking control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>'s board through a consent solicitation, said the current losses support his contention that the company has deteriorated since being taken over by corporate raider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asher Edelman</ENAMEX>. The company makes data-processing systems.
Efforts to reach Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> for comment weren't successful.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> officials blame most of the losses of the past six months on consolidations and streamlining that they estimate will reduce operating costs $20 million annually. They also say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>'s investment portfolio gained $3.3 million in the past fiscal year.
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> closed at $5.625, up 12.5 cents.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX>'s bid for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> was dealt a severe blow recently when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> bought a block of approximately three million shares, increasing his holdings to 40% from about 10% of the company's common stock outstanding. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> controls 4.6% of the company's stock.
