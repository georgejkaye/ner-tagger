Retailers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> and parts of the South are entering the critical Christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions.
In a new report, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Council of Shopping Centers</ENAMEX> said sales of general merchandise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> for the first seven months of 1989 rose 6.6% above year-earlier levels.
Sales increased a more modest 4.8% in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and 4.4% in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>. But sales in the oil-patch state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> surged 12.9% and sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> jumped 10.6% in the period, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trade group said.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>, however, sales declined 0.4% in the period, with sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> falling 2.6%.
The numbers show that ``we don't have a monolithic economy,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Lagnado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> research director. ``There are a lot of have and have-not markets.''
Sales nationally rose 3.9% through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the latest month for which the figures are available, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern California</ENAMEX> earthquake and Hurricane Hugo are likely to temporarily damp sales growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> predicted the regional trends would continue through Christmas. ``The big mo is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics,'' he said.
The Christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX>'s report is based on data the trade group buys from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Census Bureau</ENAMEX>. The information on 125 metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart Corp.</ENAMEX> as well as closely held concerns such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.H. Macy & Co.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> plans to release its regional reports monthly.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact on sales growth. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Paso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, the three strongest retail markets in the nation, are all located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, where employment grew a relatively strong 2%. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, which has lost jobs in the computer and defense-related industries, was the weakest link in bleak <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX>.
The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past two years. In 1987, the West had the slowest sales growth, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> were first and second respectively, according to the council.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lagnado</ENAMEX> said that although retailers probably won't ever recover sales lost because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> quake and Hurricane Hugo, they could see some benefits later on. Stores such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> that sell big-ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush to replace items lost in the disasters, he said.
