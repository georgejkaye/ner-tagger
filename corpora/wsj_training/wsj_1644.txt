Investors who received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX>'s latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions.
The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Portfolio Perspective</ENAMEX> are completely blank, except for the page numbers. Rather than printing devils, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market. The plunge made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX>'s market commentary instantly out of date.
In fact, last Friday's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise, not the least of them brokerage firms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX>, a 62%-owned unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX>, didn't have enough time to update its market commentary so, ``We decided to kill our strategy pieces,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Rivkin</ENAMEX>, the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX>'s research department.
The first thought some investors had was that a red-faced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary, and that's why it purged its pages. Investors recalled that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> last week had been advising that ``the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance.'' Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivkin</ENAMEX> insists that the 10 pages weren't pulled because they were too bullish. Instead, he says, ``they were cautious, and that wasn't the message we wanted to deliver'' on Monday.
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rivkin</ENAMEX> explains it, ``We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and concerns about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LBO</ENAMEX> market. And by late Friday afternoon, actually after the close, we decided that was the wrong tone to take. With the market down, we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening.''
Both before and after the Friday plunge, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65% stocks, 20% bonds and 15% cash.
