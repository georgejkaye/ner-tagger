A consortium led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrison Knudsen Corp.</ENAMEX> has proposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> regulators to build a $2.2 billion high-speed rail link that would zip passengers between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> in a mere 1 hour and 45 minutes.
The 225-mile ride, on a French train traveling 186 miles an hour, would cost about 30% less than the average one-way air fare between the cities, planners say.
Assuming the link is successful, bullet train routes could eventually be extended to link other major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> cities, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, consortium officials say. The proposal faces numerous hurdles, including an expected competing application to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas High Speed Rail Authority</ENAMEX> by a West German consortium.
The newly created rail authority, charged with licensing high-speed rail projects in the state, is expected to make a decision on the competing bids by the spring of 1990. The agency also has decreed that financing such projects will be left to the private sector, thus leaving the job of raising enormous amounts of capital to consortium members.
While sounding futuristic, the proposal is hardly pie-in-the-sky. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> have highly profitable high-speed rail systems in operation. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nevada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and numerous major cities are in various stages of considering high-speed rail plans.
Earlier this year, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Energy Department</ENAMEX>-sponsored study said that replacing a number of the nation's short-haul airline routes with high-speed rail links could result in substantial energy savings and alleviate growing congestion and delays at major airports. Between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> alone, for example, about 12,000 passengers jam 130 daily flights.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrison Knudsen consortium</ENAMEX> is spearheaded by the company's high-profile chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William M. Agee</ENAMEX> and includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEC Alsthom Inc.</ENAMEX>, the French train maker, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Barnes</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> lieutenant governor. As proposed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> link would employ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GEC</ENAMEX> Alsthom technology in which electric trains, traveling along specially constructed tracks, are able to attain speeds much higher than speeds allowed by traditional train technology.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison Knudsen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boise</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX>, is an engineering and construction concern with annual revenue of about $2 billion.
