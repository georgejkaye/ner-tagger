It took only a few months for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Tose</ENAMEX>'s creation to catch up with him.
In early 1988, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tose</ENAMEX> took time off from his job at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> brokerage firm to join a panel commissioned by the government to scrutinize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s stock and futures exchanges. The result was a 443-page report crowded with suggestions for reforming the colony's securities industry.
Now chairman of the brokerage firm and merchant bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peregrine International Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tose</ENAMEX> finds himself under the magnifying glass he helped create. The most controversial outgrowth of the panel's report -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Futures Commission</ENAMEX> -- says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peregrine</ENAMEX> may have breached <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s rules on corporate takeovers.
``I recognized that I would be regulated more,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tose</ENAMEX> says. ``The regulations have been tightened, but there's still the question of degree to be worked out.''
That question of degree has been a sensitive point from the time <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s financial community grudgingly agreed that laissez-faire would have to yield to stricter market regulation, and the issue continues to spark heated debate.
The five-month-old commission's initial moves -- including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peregrine</ENAMEX> case and another high-profile action involving locally listed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paladin Ltd.</ENAMEX> -- have furnished grist for both sides of the debate but haven't brought it any closer to a resolution.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s ambition to be seen as an international financial center has been battered regularly in the past decade, first by corporate and banking scandals in the early 1980s, and then by the four-day closure of the colony's securities markets after the global equities crash in 1987. The shutdown persuaded even reluctant participants that the markets needed tighter supervision.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Futures Commission</ENAMEX> Ordinance 1989 legislated a watchdog agency independent of the government. Although the agency may recommend that legal action be taken, its own rulings lack the force of law and depend mainly on voluntary compliance. At the same time, however, the ordinance also grants the agency unprecedented investigative powers.
The spotlight is on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Owen</ENAMEX>, a former British banker who heads the commission. During the negotiations leading to approval of the 1989 ordinance, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen</ENAMEX> stressed that the resulting agency would have to have the muscle to carry out its mandate.
In response to the current criticism, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen</ENAMEX> insists that the commission's early investigations weren't just muscle-flexing. ``We intervened because we had to,'' he says. The commission's ``principal objective is to cause the market here to develop in a long-term and consistent manner.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen</ENAMEX> thinks he may not have enough power to do the job. The issue of compliance in a self-regulatory framework is one that clearly frustrates him: ``It's not the rules but the means of ensuring that people comply with the rules.'' Indeed, the results of the initial inquiries may support his concern about the watchdog's limited powers.
The Paladin case provides an example. In August, the company proposed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Zealand Equities Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an investment concern. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> Equities and its associates held nearly 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paladin's</ENAMEX> shares, the proposal drew fire from the commission, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Stock Exchange and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> investors with a large stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paladin.</ENAMEX> All three parties said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> company shouldn't be able to vote on its own takeover.
The commission threatened to punish Paladin if the New Zealand shareholders voted, but the saber-rattling had little effect. The votes were cast, and the merger has gone ahead.
The stock exchange's chief executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Yuen</ENAMEX>, concedes that the commission is virtually impotent in such situations because its main disciplinary tools are to delist an offender or to refuse to list new shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paladin</ENAMEX>'s shares also trade on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX>'s stock exchange, so the impact of a trading suspension in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> would be lessened.
``When there's someone who doesn't want to play by the rules, you have very little power over him,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuen</ENAMEX> says. Nevertheless, he also cautions against overarming the commission: ``Because of these cases, which could be isolated, do you want to change the market to make it more costly to good companies?''
In the case of an attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Kashing</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheung Kong</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holdings) Ltd.</ENAMEX> to sell 30% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwong Sang Hong Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a small property-investment company, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peregrine</ENAMEX>, the commission is charging that the buyer and seller are acting in concert. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peregrine</ENAMEX> executives deny the assertion.
If the commission determines that the two concerns are in concert, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peregrine</ENAMEX> would have to offer to buy all of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kwong</ENAMEX> Sang <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong</ENAMEX>'s shares outstanding for HK$860 each, the price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peregrine</ENAMEX> offered when it initiated the transaction. Since then, however, the stock's price has risen to about HK$1,100, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peregrine</ENAMEX> would be hard pressed to find takers.
In the meantime, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peregrine</ENAMEX>'s offer would require that prospectuses by prepared and mailed to every Kwong Sang Hong shareholder.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tose</ENAMEX> is optimistic that the commission will say <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peregrine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheung Kong</ENAMEX> weren't acting in concert. Whatever the finding, though, he believes that the episode bodes ill for the securities markets.
``So far {the commission} has chosen the strict end of the interpretation spectrum when applying existing rules,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tose</ENAMEX>. ``If this becomes a pattern, then that's heading us toward over-regulation.
