You asked for a soft landing. You got it.
If investors are finding the economic environment bewildering these days, they shouldn't complain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confusion</ENAMEX> is the consequence of the long-hoped-for soft landing, that catch-all phrase that connotes moderating economic growth, declining inflation and lower interest rates. After all, a soft landing is neither fish nor fowl. It isn't a powerful economy that drives corporate earnings (and eventually inflation) sharply higher, but neither is it a sickening plunge into recession.
``We're all groping for the trend in the economy, and the data are contradictory,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian J. Fabbri</ENAMEX>, chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland Montagu</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``If it weren't and the statistics were all bad, we'd be talking about a recession. If the statistics were uniformly good, we'd be talking about an accelerating economy and no need for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to ease'' credit.
But all this leaves investors confused and worried. Because the economic picture is so puzzling, they don't know whether to buy or sell stocks, and which stocks they should own. That's particularly important now because this is the stage at which the economy is delicately balanced and could move quickly either into a recession or acceleration.
And that's the trouble with the ``soft landing'' analogy. While an airplane taxis to the gate and shuts off its engines after landing, the economy just keeps rolling right along.
``The logical flaw in the whole concept of a soft landing is that there isn't any end,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Solloway</ENAMEX>, chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argus Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``You either get more softness, ending up in a recession, or you take off again. You can't keep soft landing forever.''
The lack of a clear direction for the economy contributes to what some market experts call ``data paralysis,'' the tendency of traders and investors to await whatever the next economic statistics are in the hope that a clear trend will develop. Yet in the midst of a soft landing, the latest economic reports aren't very helpful.
Take last week's batch of statistics. No one claims that August retail sales, up 0.7%, were robust, but they weren't dismal either. The producer-price index -- which measures wholesale price inflation -- shows inflation dropping, but the declines were from falling prices in the volatile areas of food and fuel. The trade gap surprised most analysts by shrinking, rather than growing, and factory utilization and industrial production didn't change much from previous months' reports.
So where does all that information leave forecasters? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argus</ENAMEX>' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solloway</ENAMEX> is sticking to his guns and continuing to predict a recession, probably beginning before the end of the year. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Mcalinden</ENAMEX>, director of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillon Read</ENAMEX>, says the data reinforce his bullish view of the economy and the stock market.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solloway</ENAMEX>'s gloomy prediction of a recession stems from what he sees as a tight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> credit policy aimed at checking inflation. Relatively high interest rates are slowing retail sales, while manufacturing inventories are growing. At some point, probably soon, that leads to manufacturing cutbacks, he says, and that's what a recession is all about.
``It's a recession brought on by the simple fact that monetary policy is being kept tight to keep inflation in check,'' he says. The one bright spot in his outlook? ``It will be a mild recession, nothing like the ones we had in the mid-'70s and early'80s.''
Consistent with that forecast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argus</ENAMEX> is recommending that investors place their bets on such traditional defensive stocks as food, drug and entertainment issues and avoid any stocks tied to the economic cycle, particularly autos. The one exception: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines.</ENAMEX> ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> offers some very good value,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.C. Moore</ENAMEX>, director of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argus.</ENAMEX> ``It isn't up as much as many cyclical stocks are, and there's every reason to believe that over the next several years demand will continue for the computer hardware and data processing equipment that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> makes.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcalinden</ENAMEX>, looking at the same economic data, rejects the notion of a recession any time soon. ``The overall picture is still somewhat murky, but it's converging toward a pattern of an economy that's not falling apart and that isn't overheating with inflation,'' he says. ``That's all very bullish.''
If there's going to be any trouble at all, he adds, it's likely to be that the economy zooms upward, rather than into a recession. ``Right now, I'm very bullish on the equity market, but after a few months I think the economy is going to turn out to be expanding too strongly,'' he says. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, inflation will worsen, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> will respond to that with a severe tightening. But that might not play out until some time next year.''
Thus Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcalinden</ENAMEX> isn't at all reluctant to recommend some cyclical stocks such as heavy machinery and factory equipment, albeit with a few caveats. One is that investors should favor issues more closely tied to capital spending, rather than industrial materials like chemicals and paper. Another is that they should look for secondary stocks, not the biggest and best-known names in an industry.
``Where the fundamentals are good, I think secondary stocks will be the target of a lot of buying,'' he says. ``I {expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX> {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>} and over-the-counter markets to outperform the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials.''
One note of caution from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcalinden</ENAMEX>: be wary of takeover stocks. The problems that junk bond-financed  companies are running into, most notably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>'s troubles, don't bode well for takeover speculation, he says.
``If these problems are cropping up now with modest inflation, interest rates down and the economy expanding, what in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">God</ENAMEX>'s name do you think will happen with extremely tight money and an economic downturn?'' he asks.
Friday's Market Activity
Stock prices rose modestly as stock buying to settle futures and options positions offset more selling of takeover issues.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average gained 9.69 points to 2674.58.

But declining issues on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> were ahead of gainers 837 to 651.

But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications</ENAMEX> gained 1 7/8 to 22 1/2 after accepting a sweetened takeover bid of $25 a share from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Group</ENAMEX> and ending discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> about a rival offer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX>, the U.S. unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX>, rose 1 1/8 to 7 3/8 in over-the-counter trading; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> added 5/8 to 24 5/8 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>, which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, fell 1 3/4 to 75 7/8 as 2.2 million shares changed hands. Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall</ENAMEX> told analysts he expects slower earnings growth in the third and fourth quarters, as well as next year.
Other airline stocks also ran into selling, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>, which dropped 3/4 to 279 3/4 even though investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> said he would match the $300-a-share offer from a labor-management group if that bid isn't completed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> has already offered $275 a share for the parent company of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>.
