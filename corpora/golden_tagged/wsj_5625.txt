More than three years have passed since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lehman</ENAMEX> sat in his observation post at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and listened to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> bombers pounding Libyan air bases into dust. Now he sits at a desk high above <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sixth Avenue</ENAMEX>, planning a different kind of raid.
The former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> secretary is part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> investment-banking squad that is scouring the ranks of the nation's defense contractors, seeking possible targets for takeovers and restructurings.
``There will be consolidation world-wide'' in the defense industry, predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Modzelewski</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> defector who is a member of the seven-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> team. The resulting mergers and other deals could mean handsome profits for investors who choose the right defense stocks, analysts say.
Hostile bids and foreign suitors are rare on the military scene, of course. And takeover speculators of all stripes have been shaken by recent tremors in the junk-bond market. After the dust settles, however, the Street expects to see a number of strategic acquisitions of defense companies.
``For the first time in a long time, assets are undervalued'' in the defense sector, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard L. Schwartz</ENAMEX>, the acquisitive chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX>, the defense-electronics concern. ``Not since I have been in the business have I seen such an attractive situation for making acquisitions.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contracting</ENAMEX> scandals and bad cost judgments have combined with a shrinking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> budget to turn the defense stocks into market pariahs. Many of the issues trade at or near single-digit multiples of the companies' estimated 1989 earnings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX>, for example, is trading at less than 8 times this year's profit estimate from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX>, well below the 13 multiple for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s 500. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> trades at 11 times estimated earnings, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin Marietta</ENAMEX>'s multiple is below 9.
Some defense stocks trade below their asset values, seemingly making them takeover bait. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Metz</ENAMEX>, market strategist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX>, says defense-budget cutbacks will leave the companies with scant reason to increase capital spending, but their cash flow remains strong. It all adds up to a rocket-fuel formula that he thinks should send some of the stocks off into the wild blue yonder in takeovers.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metz</ENAMEX> says investment bankers and possible suitors are probably looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tech-Sym</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Technologies</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt & Whitney</ENAMEX> aircraft-engine business is one segment of a sprawling conglomerate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raiders</ENAMEX> have been cautious so far, however, because of the industry's ties to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and some members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Most takeovers of defense companies will be portrayed as friendly. ``Totally neutral'' is the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loral</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> describes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>'s attitude toward inter-industry marriages.
Some analysts think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> might pursue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E-Systems</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>. Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E-Systems</ENAMEX>' allure lies in its ``coded communications, spy-plane avionics -- 25% of their business is pure <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> kind of stuff,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary J. Reich</ENAMEX>. Loral focuses on a different area of defense electronics, namely communications and electronic-defense systems. From 1984 through 1988, Esystems sales rose 85% while operating profit increased only 21%, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Modzelewski</ENAMEX> says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E-Systems</ENAMEX> holders might demand that a suitor pay at least 50 for their shares, which closed yesterday at 34 1/8.
Another company well-positioned for the industry change to more surveillance and less armament is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watkins-Johnson</ENAMEX>.
``It is a well-managed company with strong underlying cash flow,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oppenheimer</ENAMEX>'s Lior <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bregman</ENAMEX>. It has businesses in intelligence, microwave and semiconductor components, and recently acquired a company that measures water contamination. Cash flow -- defined as operating profit plus depreciation, minus expenses for equipment -- is a strong $5 a share. At midyear the company had $27 million in cash and long-term debt of only $22 million, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bregman</ENAMEX> says. The shares are worth 45 on a takeover basis, he says; they closed yesterday at 25 1/8.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> would make a nice fit with a larger aerospace concern, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX>: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> would acquire fighter-plane expertise.'' Some think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> shares, at 21 1/2 yesterday, could fetch 35 in a takeover. But a suitor might wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> to hit the skids and ask for federal assistance before assuming its heavy debts.
More than 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> is owned by the Crown family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, which analysts believe might sell to an aggressive bidder. The highly diversified company makes submarines, fighter planes, tanks and missiles. Again, a merger might require federal aid because of the company's heavy liabilities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Simmons</ENAMEX> holds nearly 10% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX>, but many analysts think he is merely hoping to attract a larger buyer, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Modzelewski</ENAMEX> says ``the numbers work well into the 70s'' for a takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> -- at 48 3/8 yesterday -- ``but you are still dealing in time frames of over a year.''
A final caveat comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan de L. Squires</ENAMEX>, senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinwort Benson</ENAMEX>: ``If there is no takeover,'' he warns, ``what is supporting the earnings of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tech-Sym</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watkins-Johnson</ENAMEX>? They are vulnerable to a shrinking defense budget.
