The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly.
In the aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> earthquake, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning. Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> in action.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> Valdez oil tanker split open in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaskan</ENAMEX> waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolina</ENAMEX> coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now. So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> announced that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sununu</ENAMEX>.
By noon, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had taken two phone calls from Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX>, who was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX>; and visited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> headquarters.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism. On his FEMA visit, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that he hoped there would be ``less carping'' about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency ``took a hit'' for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> already is talking of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> earthquake site this weekend. He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so.
