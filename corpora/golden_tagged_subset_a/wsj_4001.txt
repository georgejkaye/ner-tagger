<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is back, fiddling with the clock and moving a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> hospital across county lines again to justify higher Medicare payments to its operators.
The hospital, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> Baptist of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> never, in fact, moves. Nor does the line between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Crawford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Franklin</ENAMEX> counties. But money does -- in this case an estimated $1.2 million in Medicare reimbursements withheld by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Finance Administration</ENAMEX> after it claimed it had overpaid the hospital's previous owner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> moved the hospital in December 1987, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> delegation attached an amendment directing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> to count the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> -- and the hospital -- as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> metropolitan area. This was refined last year to specifically move the hospital from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crawford</ENAMEX> to nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Franklin County</ENAMEX>, thereby qualifying the 81-bed facility for higher reimbursements paid to urban hospitals.
The effective date was Dec. 22, 1987, to accommodate the current owner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri Baptist Medical Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>. But now the previous owner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX>, and its allies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> delegation are back with the same idea, only the effective date would be more than four years earlier, Oct. 1, 1983. The impact would be to resolve the government's dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX> in favor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> corporation, which enlisted the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>-area Republicans to include the date change in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> spending bill for the current fiscal year, which began Sunday.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX>, which has jurisdiction over Medicare, has protested the amendment. But a principal architect is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> panel's ranking Republican, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Archer</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archer</ENAMEX> worked through a fellow Texan, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Delay</ENAMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Treasury</ENAMEX> and Postal appropriations subcommittee, which has no jurisdiction over Medicare but got involved in 1987 when the initial amendment made reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>, which is funded by the subcommittee.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference last week accepted the provision with no discussion of the potential cost to the government. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senators</ENAMEX> were initially reluctant but went along in what amounted to a swap in return for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> accepting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> provision also troublesome to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCFA</ENAMEX> had no comment yesterday on where it stands, but the agency has sometimes seemed overwhelmed itself by the vagaries of the complicated cost-containment and rate schedules for federal health programs. Whether by error or purpose, the government, in fact, made reimbursements to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX> for some years based on the assumption that the hospital -- about 60 miles from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> -- qualified for the higher urban rate. In 1987, when reviewing the sale, the agency apparently took notice of the actual location in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Crawford County</ENAMEX>, and this led to the withholding of $1.2 million from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX> and claims that as much as $1.4 million was owed because of overpayments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hux</ENAMEX> said yesterday that the publicly held hospital management corporation is the victim of a bureaucratic error, and the higher rate is justified in any case because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s proximity to the metropolitan area. ``It was something <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had to resolve,'' he said.
