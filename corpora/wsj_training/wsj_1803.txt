Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area for months to come.
But rail, air and ocean-shipping links to the area escaped Tuesday's earthquake with only minor damage, and many are expected to be operating normally today, government and corporate transport officials said.
Air traffic at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco International Airport</ENAMEX> was running about 50% of normal yesterday afternoon, but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by Saturday. The major gateway to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and one of the nation's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit Tuesday afternoon, until 6 a.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PDT</ENAMEX> yesterday when controllers returned to the tower.
Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem, however. ``People's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted,'' said a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Automobile Association</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Schumacher</ENAMEX>, executive vice president and general manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Trucking Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacremento</ENAMEX>, said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area yesterday, except for emergency-medical supplies. ``Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday,'' he said. ``Right now most of the roads into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area are closed, but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes. This {Wednesday} morning the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mateo</ENAMEX> bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schumacher</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Parcel Service</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, said its operations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area have been reduced to 40% of normal. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> spokesman said that although none of the company's terminals, trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake, road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages. The spokesman noted four-hour to five-hour traffic delays on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mateo</ENAMEX> bridge, for example. In addition, power failures prevented its package-sorting facilities from operating, causing delays.
But freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX>'s rail unit the least affected by the quake. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> stopped freight trains Tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10:45 p.m. when they found no damage.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX>'s rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> yard, its track, bridges and structures were unharmed. That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ENAMEX>, the hardest hit of the three railroads in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area, said service on its north-south coastline, which is used by an Amtrak train between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>, was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake. But service on the line is expected to resume by noon today. ``We had no serious damage on the railroad,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Pacific</ENAMEX> spokesman. ``We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> said it suspended train service into its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> station, which sustained ``heavy structural damage'' during the quake. The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX>, relying on buses to ferry passengers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> said it planned to resume some train operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> late yesterday.
Rail-transit operations suffered little damage, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Engelken</ENAMEX>, deputy executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Public Transit Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> Rapid Transit ``withstood the earthquake perfectly,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>, adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers. ``The highway system is screwed up'' by the earthquake, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> said. ``The transit system is how people are going to be getting around.'' He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels.
Although air-traffic delays in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were significant yesterday, they didn't appear to spread to other airports. The earthquake shattered windows at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco International</ENAMEX>'s air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers, three of whom suffered minor injuries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminals</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco International</ENAMEX> also were damaged, but the tower itself was intact. Tuesday night, thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runways</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> weren't damaged, but traffic was being limited yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour -- down from 33 to 45 an hour normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said.
While the airport was closed, flights were diverted to airports in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stockton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Reno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nev.</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>, the largest carrier at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, was operating only 50% of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal, which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable, mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport; in fact, as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night, two babies were born.
Yesterday, the United ticket counter was active, with people trying to get flights out, but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active, with people trying to get there to help family and friends.
The airports in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Jose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> were both fully operational by noon yesterday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said.
In terms of diversions, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stapleton International</ENAMEX> may have experienced the most far-flung: A United flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> was rerouted there. ``I think that's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> to land here,'' an airport spokesman said.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX> spokesman said its flights into and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> weren't affected, but getting information about its operations was difficult. Its telecommunications headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burlingame</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, had been knocked out since the quake. ``We're in the dark,'' he said.
