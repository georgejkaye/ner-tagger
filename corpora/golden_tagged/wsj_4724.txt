The acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX>, a British information company, fits neatly into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX>'s goal of getting 20% of its revenue from overseas by the mid-1990s.
In an interview at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> headquarters, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert E. Allen</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s best hope for growing overseas revenue rests with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Network Systems</ENAMEX> and international long-distance business. Because domestic growth from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Network Systems</ENAMEX>, which sells equipment and software to phone companies, is relatively flat, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> needs to sell more overseas. Annual revenue for the telecommunications giant is about $35 billion.
``Growth rates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> aren't enough to sustain the business here for an extended period of time given the capital requirements'' of making and selling telephone network equipment, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said. ``It's a healthy business, now. But to keep it that way, you need to experience some growth somewhere.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> has targeted certain countries for expansion based on the openness of the market and how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s technology fits into that market. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> is one such strategic market, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> doesn't plan to bid for the Mexican phone company, which the government has said it wants to privatize. ``I don't have any interest in acquiring a phone system in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, but we'd love to be a supplier,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said. However, ``if a country said,'Look, we'll give you all our business, but you have to buy the phone company,' I'd look seriously at that,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Bloc</ENAMEX> countries and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, where phone service is poor, are long-range opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said. Just before the unrest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> had agreed to form a joint venture there making transmission equipment. That venture hasn't been terminated, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said, but it will probably take longer than expected to execute.
As is usual in the fall, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> is setting budgets for next year and trying to determine if it has too many employees to serve its markets. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said he believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> still has too many employees, but it will take executives a few months to decide if that number can be reduced through attrition, another early retirement program or some other method.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company will probably decide within the month whether to sweeten its pension benefits to encourage certain employees to retire early.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> also said that the company is studying how to improve profits from its private branch exchange, or PBX, business. The market is plagued by price-cutting. ``I don't know of anyone who is making much money,'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBX</ENAMEX> business, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> is continuing to change its culture from that of an in-grown, self-absorbed regulated concern to that of a competitive concern focused on serving customers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said. In a telling departure from past practices, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> only last week put out an organization chart showing who reports to whom under a new structure announced last spring that created 19 business units, abolished the office of the chairman and established a 12-man executive committee.
``We used to draw up organization charts then say'Okay, you guys figure out how this works,' ``said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>. ``Now we figure out how things work,'' then develop an organizational structure that fits the concept, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> also has changed its focus on acquisitions. It once studied making large, multibillion-dollar acquisitions. While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> still looks at such large deals, now ``it's more of a string-of-pearls approach as opposed to (making) a big deal,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said.
Executives here also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> is considering manufacturing its own facsimile machines and could someday make its own personal computers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> recently agreed to have a new line of personal computers made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> Its fax machines are currently made under an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ricoh Co.</ENAMEX>
Finally, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> continues to study whether to expand into the credit card or charge card business by expanding the services offered by its calling cards. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> recently hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kahn</ENAMEX>, an executive from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Chicago Corp.</ENAMEX>, as general manager, consumer financial services, to help it determine whether or not to change the business of its calling cards, which are now used by customers only for charging long-distance phone calls.
