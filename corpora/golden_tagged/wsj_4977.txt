<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Receptech Corp.</ENAMEX> said they filed a joint registration statement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> for a proposed initial public offering of 2.5 million units for $30 million, or $12 a unit.
Under the offering, each unit will hold one share of callable common stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Receptech</ENAMEX>, a shell formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> executives to conduct research on Immunex products, and a warrant to buy one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> common stock. The shares and warrants will trade as one unit through June 30, 1992, at which point they will trade separately.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX>, a biotechnology concern, said the agreement also allows it to buy all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Receptech</ENAMEX> shares issued under the offering before June 30, 1992.
A company spokesman said such a transaction would depend on the merit of the research conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Receptech</ENAMEX>, formed in August to develop cytokine receptor products for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema and septic shock.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Receptech</ENAMEX> said they have given underwriters the option to buy up to 375,000 additional units to cover over-allotments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Capital Funding</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambrecht & Quist Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, are managing underwriters.
The joint filing follows a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX> announcements last week under which the company will re-acquire the right to manufacture and market promising biological agents for the treatment of cancer and immune dysfunction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunex</ENAMEX>, which in the early 1980s licensed away the right to make and sell products it had developed, now has shifted gears and is reclaiming rights to such products in an effort to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company.
