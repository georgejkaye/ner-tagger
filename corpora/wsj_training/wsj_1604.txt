The earthquake that hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area isn't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings, officials at the two major rating agencies said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor's Corp.</ENAMEX> is reviewing debt issued by 12 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> counties, and ``there are potential isolated problems,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyman Grossman</ENAMEX>, a managing director. The agency is preparing a report, to be issued today, on the earthquake's impact on the property - and casualty-insurance industry.
The only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Savings & Loan.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> said it is reviewing, with an eye toward a possible downgrade, the ratings on Bay View <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> bonds, long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company, Bay View <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Corp.</ENAMEX>
As for property and casualty insurers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX> said ``preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers' financial condition,'' but it ``raises concerns about potentially substantial risks'' longer-term.
``Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo,'' according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody</ENAMEX>'s.
