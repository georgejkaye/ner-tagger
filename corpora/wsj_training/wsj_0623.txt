The fiscal 1989 budget deficit figure came out Friday. It was down a little. The next time you hear a Member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> moan about the deficit, consider what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> did Friday. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, 84-6, voted to increase to $124,000 the ceiling on insured mortgages from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX>, which lost $4.2 billion in loan defaults last year.
Then, by voice vote, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> voted a pork-barrel bill, approved Thursday by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, for domestic military construction. Compare the Bush request to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senators</ENAMEX> gave themselves:
For construction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> requested $4.5 million; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> gave Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX>'s state $21.5 million. Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> is chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>, a $1.8 million request became $12 million for Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grassley</ENAMEX>, ranking minority member of a military construction subcommittee. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> and chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Appropriations</ENAMEX> turned a $20 million Bush request for his state into a $49.7 million bequest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senator Sasser</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s $87 million request for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> increased to $109 million. In a remark someone should remember this time next year, Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sasser</ENAMEX> said, ``I think we've seen the peak of military construction spending for many years to come.''
Tell us about spending restraint. Tell us about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals. Tell us what measure, short of house arrest, will get this Congress under control.
