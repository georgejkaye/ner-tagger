<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buell Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> said it has agreed to sell the assets of its small screw and nut product lines here to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Tool Works Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. Terms weren't provided.
For the nine months ending July 31, the product lines represented about $15 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buell</ENAMEX>'s $66 million in sales, but ``could not be operated profitably in the face of increased operating costs, declining sales, the prospect of major pollution-control expenditures and little expectation of price relief in a very competitive market,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buell</ENAMEX> said in a news release.
As a result of the sale, about 175 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buell</ENAMEX>'s 600 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Waterbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, employees will lose their jobs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buell</ENAMEX>, which also makes larger diameter fasteners and metal stampings, employs about 150 elsewhere.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Tool</ENAMEX> makes specialty tools.
