<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Business Group Inc.</ENAMEX> said it filed suit in federal court here charging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist Inc.</ENAMEX> and its directors with violating federal securities laws ``by engaging in a scheme to prevent'' Royal from acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX>.
Royal, which makes and distributes business forms, owns an 8% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX>. Royal contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX> failed to disclose material information, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX>'s negotiations to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ammann Laser Technik AG</ENAMEX>, to stockholders prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX>'s June 6 annual meeting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal's</ENAMEX> suit contends that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ammann</ENAMEX> acquisition was ``designed to entrench management and thwart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal's</ENAMEX> offer.''
Royal withdrew its offer to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX>, a maker of optical and electronic products based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Menomonee Falls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wis.</ENAMEX>, for $14.06 a share in July after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX> disclosed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ammann</ENAMEX> purchase. The suit seeks ``in excess of $350,000 in damages.''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Realist</ENAMEX> official said the company hadn't yet received the full complaint and wouldn't have a response until it had an opportunity to review it.
