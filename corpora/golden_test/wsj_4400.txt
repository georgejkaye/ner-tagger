Major trans-Pacific container ship companies have agreed to raise shipping rates to Asia from the U.S. and Canada effective next April 1.
The Trans-Pacific Westbound Rate Agreement, a rate-making body based in San Francisco, said its 10 members plan to raise rates by $140 to $250 a 40-foot container, or about 10%. The ship conference represents such major carriers as American President Cos., Maersk Line and Sea-Land Services Inc., a unit of CSX Corp.
The increase, if it sticks, would help restore westbound container rates to 1979 levels before rates plummeted, the conference said. Among the commodities affected are forest products, scrap metal, chemicals, resins, hay, food products and manufactured goods.
Ronald Gottshall, the conference's managing director, said attempts by trans-Pacific carriers to raise westbound rates Sept. 1 and March 1 were largely resisted by shippers.
The conference hopes to garner greater support for its April 1 rate increase by giving shippers six months advance notice. ``Shippers have indicated that it makes their lives much easier if they can plan for rate changes way in advance,'' says Sally Smith, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore.
