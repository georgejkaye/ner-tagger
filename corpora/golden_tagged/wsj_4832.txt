In the immediate aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini</ENAMEX>'s edict against Salman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rushdie</ENAMEX>, it was widely assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Islam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> and ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satanic Verses</ENAMEX>'' would be rendered off bounds as subjects for critical discussion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Sontag</ENAMEX>, for example, predicted ``a globalization of fear and vulnerability.''
More than half a year after the edict, how do things look? It is now clear that while Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sontag</ENAMEX> and others may have overstated the problem, they did not do so by very much. Not only do Salman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rushdie</ENAMEX>'s life and career remain upended by the edict, but free speech remains imperiled in a host of ways, large and small, in distant places and at home.
Writers and artists in Moslem  countries have felt the chilling effect most severely. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX>, for example, the prominent feminist Nawal as-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sa</ENAMEX>'dawi has abandoned a novel-in-progress titled ``The Book of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX>,'' which imagines <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satan</ENAMEX>'s views on issues in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bible</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Koran</ENAMEX>. Not unreasonably, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sa</ENAMEX>'dawi decided that 1989 was not an auspicious year for such a book. To make matters worse, even after her backtracking, she received so many death threats the police had to provide her with round-the-clock protection.
The new atmosphere is even more obvious in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. Fearful of more riots, deaths and anti-government sentiment, Interior Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atzez Ahsan</ENAMEX> in February summarily banned two books on the Prophet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX>. Then Nazia <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX>, the exceedingly demure female star of a television show, ``Music 89,'' became the center of a major controversy. Although Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX>, a rock singer, always covered her hair and showed only her face and hands, fundamentalist Moslems so harassed her and the television authorities that the program was gutted in April. As a weary Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan</ENAMEX> explained, ``Everything in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, even the way you sing a song, is highly politicized now.''
This change in climate has caused more than a few moderate Moslem writers and artists to resent Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rushdie</ENAMEX> for bringing fundamentalist scrutiny to their activities. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dahmane Abderahmane</ENAMEX>, a young French Moslem, explained: ``We condemn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rushdie</ENAMEX> because he was the man who permitted Khomeini to regain his breath.''
And what about the West? To begin with, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satanic Verses</ENAMEX>'' incident itself remains delicate for publishers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Collins Sons</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based division of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s publishing empire) commissioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Appignanesi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sara Maitland</ENAMEX> to assemble a collection of documents on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rushdie</ENAMEX> affair. Then, just three weeks later, in May, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> got cold feet and decided not to go ahead with the book. Coming up with one explanation after another (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> did not want to exacerbate problems for Viking, publisher of ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satanic Verses</ENAMEX>''; the book was commercially not viable; the book was not objective), the company did whatever it had to do to renege on its contract.
Shortly after, I had a similar experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harper & Row</ENAMEX> (another division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> empire). On May 8, the publisher and I signed a contract for a book on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rushdie</ENAMEX> affair; the manuscript was submitted on May 31 and accepted for publication. But then, on June 23, I was informed that the book had been discovered to be commercially not viable.
Self-censorship, though unmeasurable, is widespread. In the days immediately following <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Khomeini</ENAMEX>'s threat, bookers for American television shows such as ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macneil\ Newshour</ENAMEX>'' and ``Nightline'' complained that prominent authors refused to discuss ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satanic Verses</ENAMEX>.'' Nor were the famous alone in their fear of reprisals. When the bookstore at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wayne State University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> refused to stock ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satanic Verses</ENAMEX>,'' faculty members drew up a petition calling for a boycott of the store. A good number of professors refused to sign, however, fearful of becoming targets for fundamentalist Moslems.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Berlin</ENAMEX> in March, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akademie</ENAMEX> der <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kunste</ENAMEX> refused to allow a reading from ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satanic Verses</ENAMEX>'' on its premises for security reasons. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> in May, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austrian Students Association</ENAMEX> had to hold its reading in a tent because professors refused to allow the event to take place on university grounds.
More broadly, a number of works critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Islam</ENAMEX> have been withdrawn or altered. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veronique Sanson</ENAMEX>, a French singer, announced in February that threats against her life forced her to retract her song ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allah</ENAMEX>,'' a protest against intolerance and religious fanaticism. By this time, anyway, many record stores had already pulled the song.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> this summer, a BBC production celebrating renowned blasphemers, including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rushdie</ENAMEX>, was almost canceled because of protests. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archbishop</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canterbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Runcie</ENAMEX>, led the protests, which also mobilized Moslems in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. (``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blasphemers</ENAMEX>' Banquet'' was shown on July 31.)
These and many other incidents make it clear that a chilling effect exists and is not abating. Though small matters in themselves, they raise the important fact that a distant tyrant can censor works internationally. They also confirm, once again, the fragility of free speech -- even here.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pipes</ENAMEX> is director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Policy Research Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. His book ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rushdie</ENAMEX> Affair'' will be published by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birch Lane Press</ENAMEX> in early 1990.
