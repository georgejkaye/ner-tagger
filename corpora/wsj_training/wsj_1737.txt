(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
PUTS AND CALLS, STOCK MARKET PATOIS for options to sell or buy a company's shares, were long an arcane Wall Street art best left to the experts, who used them either as a hedge or for pure speculation.
Options lost some of their mystery in 1973 when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> set up a special exchange to deal in them. Until then, options had been traded only in the over-the-counter market, mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, and in an almost invisible secondary market operating chiefly by telephone.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX>, the No. 1 U.S. grain market, had long chafed under the attention won by its innovative archrival, the livestock-dealing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX>. So the men who ran the grain pits listened when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Sullivan</ENAMEX>, a 35-year-old former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> newsman, offered them the idea of all-options trading. After four year of tinkering and $2.4 million in seed money, the board set up the new marketplace, titled it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX>, and named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> its first president.
The beginnings were modest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBOE</ENAMEX> opened for business on April 26, 1973, in what had been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Trade</ENAMEX> lunchroom. It listed just 16 options to buy a ``pilot list'' of stocks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puts</ENAMEX>,  or sell options, would not be added until 1977.) The 282 members had paid $10,000 apiece for seats. (The 1989 price: $250,000.)
The first day's business was 911 contracts (each for 100 shares of one of the listed stocks). By the end of 1973, the number of ``underlying'' Big Board stocks had been increased to 50 and the options exchange had run up volume of 1.1 million contracts. A year later, it was 5.7 million. Last year, more than 1,800 traders on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBOE</ENAMEX> bought and sold 112 million contracts on 178 listed stocks, 60% of all U.S. listed options trading.
The new exchange drew instant recognition from an unwelcome quarter. The government, campaigning against fixed brokerage commissions, promptly sued the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBOE</ENAMEX> over its minimum-fee system.
