Japanese companies have long been accused of sacrificing profit to boost sales. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu Ltd.</ENAMEX> has taken that practice to a new extreme.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s biggest computer maker last week undercut seven competitors to win a contract to design a mapping system for the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>'s waterworks. Its bid: one yen, or less than a U.S. penny.
The bid created such a furor that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> said it is now offering to withdraw from the project. ``From a common-sense viewpoint, it was not socially acceptable,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said yesterday. Hiroshima city officials couldn't be reached to find out whether they would drop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX>'s bid.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> said it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market.
``We desperately wanted the contract because we want experience in the field,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said. ``We expect a big market in the future, so in the long term it will be profitable. It's a kind of an investment.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>'s waterworks bureau said the municipal government had budgeted about 11 million yen ($77,500) for the project. ``I was flabbergasted,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tatsuhara Yamane</ENAMEX>, head of the bureau, was quoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyodo</ENAMEX> news service as saying. ``I understand the firm's enthusiasm in getting the deal, but such a large company would have been better off showing a little more discretion.''
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> officials admitted they may have been a little overzealous. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said headquarter officials didn't approve the bid in advance and will take measures so this kind of thing doesn't happen in the future. ``It's contrary to common sense,'' she added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specifically</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> won the right to design the specifications for a computerized system that will show water lines throughout the city. The system could be used in a fire or earthquake to locate problems, among other things.
A waterworks official said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> will have to design the system so it would be compatible with other makers' equipment. But industry officials expressed concern that the initial project might give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> an edge in winning more lucrative contracts later.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> said it hopes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> contract will help it secure pacts with other municipalities. Japanese local governments are expected to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years, and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue. ``In the near future, it will be a big market, not just for waterworks, but for all mapping systems,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said. ``We can expect a hundreds-of-billions-of-yen market.''
No foreign companies bid on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> project, according to the bureau. But the Japanese practice of deep discounting often is cited by Americans as a classic barrier to entry in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s market. Earlier this year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> complained that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s supercomputer makers were effectively closing out foreign competitors by slashing prices as much as 90% for universities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu</ENAMEX> wasn't the only company willing to sacrifice profit on the project. Three competitors bid between 300,000 yen and 500,000 yen, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hiroshima</ENAMEX> government office. Other bids ranged from about 10 million yen to 29 million yen.
