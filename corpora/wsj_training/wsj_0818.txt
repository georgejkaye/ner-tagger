The Big Three U.S. auto makers posted losses in their core North American automotive businesses for the third quarter, and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over the fourth period.
The strongest sign of the Big Three's woes came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>, which said it had a loss in its U.S. automotive business for the first time since 1982. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> predicted fourth-quarter net income will fall below the year-earlier level, partly because of a likely $500 million charge from the sale of its steel operations.
The bleak automotive results were offset by strong earnings from some non-automotive operations. Still, the combined profit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> fell 44% to $1.02 billion from $1.83 billion a year earlier, excluding a one-time gain of $309 million at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> from the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> stock. The last time all three companies reported North American automotive losses was in the recession year of 1982.
Yesterday's announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s common closed at $44.375 a share, down 50 cents, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> fell 37.5 cents to end at $47.50, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> eased 37.5 cents to $22.25, all in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
The market's pessimism reflects the gloomy outlook in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>. As Japanese auto makers gained market share, the Big Three, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> in the lead, slashed North American production and launched a retail discounting blitz. The price war peaked in the third quarter as Big Three factory discounts climbed to more than $1,000 a vehicle, according to industry officials. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> probably had the ``heaviest incentives,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert S. Miller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s chief financial officer. ``We all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them.''
But the costly efforts did little to slow Japanese market gains, and domestic car sales have plunged 19% since the Big Three ended many of their programs Sept. 30. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> have already cut fourth-quarter U.S. output plans an estimated 15% from 1988 levels. If sales don't pick up, the cuts will go deeper and incentives will sprout again.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, which has long boasted of its ability to weather a downturn, saw earnings take a beating. The No. 2 auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production -- both the result of a substantially weaker <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market -- for a 44% drop in net to $477.1 million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $20.24 billion.
Nearly all the decline came in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s U.S. automotive operations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dearborn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, auto maker ran a loss of $37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, a deterioration of $378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services. A year earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> reported record net of $856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, on revenue of $20.38 billion. In the latest nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> earned $3.52 billion, or $7.51 a share, compared with $4.14 billion, or $8.53 a share.
The U.S. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had reeled off 12 consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the 1989 second quarter. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David N. Mccammon</ENAMEX>, vice president, finance, insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results ``better in this downturn than in prior downturns,'' when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> had net losses.
Still, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccammon</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> expects the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy to weaken through the end of 1990, causing weaker sales and production. As a result, fourth-quarter profit will come in below 1988 results, although the drop won't be as sharp as the 44% third-quarter decline, he said.
Part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $500 million from the proposed sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rouge Steel</ENAMEX> unit. In the 1988 fourth quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> had net of $1.16 billion, or $2.42 a share.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s operating profit fell to a scant $22 million, or 10 cents a share, its lowest quarterly total in seven years.
Its $309 million, or $1.32 a share, gain from the sale of 75 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> shares made net $331 million, or $1.42 a share. Sales were flat at $7.88 billion. The results include record quarterly earnings of $76 million from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> A year earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s net was $113 million, or 50 cents a share.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said costs of incentives caused a ``moderate'' loss in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Highland Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, company's North American car and truck business. He said the loss wasn't ``that much different'' from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s $37 million loss on U.S. automotive operations, but he declined to be specific.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> spent an average of $1,000 a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter, compared with about $450 a vehicle a year earlier -- a ``high-water mark'' at the time.
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> ``is no longer sure'' of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of 14.2 million in the 1990 model year. Consumers, he said, are balking at higher prices on 1990 cars, especially after seeing the incentive-reduced prices on 1989 models.
In the nine months, net was $1.02 billion, or $4.38 a share, including the gain from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> stock sale, compared with $617 million, or $2.77 a share, after a charge of $93 million, or 42 cents a share, for plant closings in the 1988 period. Sales rose 8.4% to $27.95 billion from $25.78 billion.
Heavy losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North American</ENAMEX> auto operations sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s net tumbling to $516.9 million from a record $859.2 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> doesn't issue separate quarterly earnings for the North American automotive business. But analysts estimated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> had a loss of as much as $300 million on domestic vehicle operations.
An 8.5% drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North American</ENAMEX> factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue, and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on 1990 model vehicles delivered during the period, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations. In one breakdown, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> attributed half of its net to its two big technology units, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Data Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM Hughes Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year's record full-year net of $2.7 billion.
The diversified operations helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> build its cash reserves, exclusive of its financial subsidiary, to $5.5 billion as of Sept. 30, a 22% increase from a year earlier. This cushion could come in handy if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has to trim fourth-quarter North American production schedules more than the already scheduled 9.5%.
Under the circumstances, it won't be easy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> to exceed its record 1988 fourth-quarter net of $1.4 billion, the spokesman acknowledged. That means it's unlikely the company will surpass last year's $4.9 billion full-year profit, even though net for the first nine months was up 1.9% to $3.52 billion on revenue of $95.57 billion. It earned $3.46 billion on revenue of $91.21 billion in the 1988 nine months.
