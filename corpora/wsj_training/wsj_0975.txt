A proposed conflict-of-interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures, say financiers, researchers and university administrators.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses -- or lose their government money. Among other concerns, the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs. As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years, governmental fear of abuse has risen.
But the guidelines could ``make it impossible to commercialize research,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Smith</ENAMEX>, associate provost and vice president for research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15. After that, it will make a final decision on the policy.
The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lithox Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salem</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, start-up, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX>, a managing partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA Associates</ENAMEX>, a venture-capital firm. With $2.3 million, he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>.
The researchers, who are being financed by the Lithox funds, will receive a royalty, or percentage of sales, if their research yields a commercial product. But because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, like many other universities, shares its royalties with researchers, it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> says.
The high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth Bioventures Inc.</ENAMEX>, a venture-capital concern, last month invested $600,000 to launch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amira Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Worcester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, concern that will produce pharmaceuticals. Scientists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rima Kaddurah-Daouk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Schimmel</ENAMEX> conducted the initial research at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Technology</ENAMEX>. While Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaddurah-Daouk</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> to head <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amira</ENAMEX>, Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schimmel</ENAMEX> will continue to work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>, serve on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amira</ENAMEX>'s board and own a small equity stake in the company.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amira</ENAMEX> transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research. While universities develop the basic research, ``venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria W. Doubleday</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth.</ENAMEX> ``This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities.''
But the new guidelines could prevent scientists like Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schimmel</ENAMEX> from being involved with start-ups such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amira</ENAMEX>, venture capitalists point out. And if that happens, the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed, they say.
The stakes in the controversy are large. Last year, venture capitalists spent an estimated $600 million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Venture Capital Association</ENAMEX>, a trade group. Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties.
In many of these deals, ``venture capitalists had the inside track,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Bock</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avalon Ventures</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> Investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because ``we had exclusive rights to those technologies,'' he adds.
But under the proposed guidelines, all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work. ``Without the exclusivity, most venture capitalists won't have the incentive to invest in such deals,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bock</ENAMEX> says.
Last year, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avalon</ENAMEX> and others invested $14 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena Neurosciences Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain. But before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Athena</ENAMEX> was able to get an exclusive license to the technology, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Register</ENAMEX> published most of the details, ``giving all of the company's potential competitors a chance to exploit it,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bock</ENAMEX> says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athena</ENAMEX> eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it. But, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bock</ENAMEX>, ``It was a close call.''
The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce capital, entrepreneurs say. If start-ups can't have early access to research being conducted at institutions, ``we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Emyanitoff</ENAMEX>, manager of business development at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied biotechnology Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, concern. Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emyanitoff</ENAMEX> says.
For its part, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> insists that its guidelines ``should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use.'' Universities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katherine Bick</ENAMEX>, who oversees the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> grants program as its deputy director for extramural research.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures. Not long ago, scientists holding stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc.</ENAMEX> were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock. Many officials are also concerned about companies getting a ``free ride'' on government-sponsored research. A congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their research.
Among other provisions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bick</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> administrator, says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be ``ideas for discussion.'' The predictions of doom are ``premature,'' she says.
But when agencies like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> circulate guidelines, they've often already formulated policy, veteran scientists say. Indeed, institutions already are taking note. On Sept. 14, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> began circulating a conflict-of-interest policy statement that, in effect, would follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> guidelines faithfully.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business. In many other institutions, scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> policy is settled.
Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX>, the venture capitalist: ``It doesn't matter whether they call it  guidelines or policy. The damage is already done.
