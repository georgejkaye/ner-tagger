<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merksamer Jewelers Inc.</ENAMEX>, a fast-growing jewelry store chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain.
The filing, made yesterday  in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, follows an agreement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.J. Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX>'s owner, to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Capital Corp.</ENAMEX>, a financial services subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>, is providing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> management with $15 million in financing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. Altman & Co.</ENAMEX> department store chain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX> is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX>'s planned sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> is subject to approval by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brozman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ENAMEX>.
Rumors to the effect that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> chain would file for Chapter 11 arose last week in the jewelry industry. At that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Merksamer</ENAMEX>, president of the chain, angrily denied that his company was about to file. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> is leading the buy-out.
According to executives close to the situation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> filed for Chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain. One executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.J. Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> had frozen in place all of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX>'s assets.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement. ``By filing for Chapter 11, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merksamer</ENAMEX> chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale, not the hundreds of unsecured creditors,'' said this executive. ``The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker, but the company itself will belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Merksamer</ENAMEX>.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Sigoloff</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX>, were unavailable for comment. In a statement, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merksamer</ENAMEX> described the filing as a ``legal technicality,'' but also said that ``our inability to obtain trade credit, combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the Christmas season, necessitated our filing Chapter 11.''
The jewelry chain, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, had revenue of $62 million and operating profit of $2.5 million for the year ended June 30.
