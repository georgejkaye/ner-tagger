``It's neither train nor truck,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas L. Finkbiner</ENAMEX>, standing in a small rail yard here.
As he speaks, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern Corp.</ENAMEX> diesel locomotive en route from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> approaches. Behind it stretches a string of truck trailers, rubber tires retracted, rolling along the main line tracks on steel-flanged wheels.
When the hybrid vehicles enter the yard, crewmen with wrenches turn pneumatic valves on several, lowering their rubber tires like landing gear and retracting their steel wheels. Quickly, the Roadrailer trailers are ready for the road.
``We don't call them trains, because train suggests slow and dumpy,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern</ENAMEX>'s assistant vice president of international and intermodal marketing. ``Roadrailers are fast and sleek.''
The hard-charging Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> is spearheading a high-profile gamble that Roadrailer technology can pump new life into the nation's underused rails and win back high-value merchandise freight from truckers. Faced with stagnant or declining bulk shipments, railroads must ``capture new markets to survive,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Withuhn</ENAMEX>, transportation curator of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian Institution</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern</ENAMEX> set a record of 2,117 trailer loads a week on its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roadrailers</ENAMEX>; it had none three years ago. Although Roadrailer service is still a small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern</ENAMEX>, generating about $60 million, or 1.5%, of corporate railroad revenue this year, it is reaping praise and freight from major shippers. For 36-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX>, the challenge now is to make it profitable.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> also markets the company's piggyback trains, which transport highway trailers on flatcars. But the 48-foot Roadrailer trailers are his passion. By avoiding the expensive terminals needed to load flatcars, fuel-efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roadrailers</ENAMEX> will make rail a competitor again in the shorter haul freight routes dominated by trucks, he says.
Other railroads have dumped Roadrailer because of problems ranging from the high cost of the specialized trailers to derailments, shipper disinterest and financial losses. ``We didn't think it was a viable technology,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Sorrow</ENAMEX>, a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSX Corp.</ENAMEX>'s intermodal unit, which dropped its Roadrailer service last spring. That left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern</ENAMEX> as the only U.S. railroad still Roadrailing.
``I really don't care what someone else does,'' says the former trucking and air freight executive who remains contemptuous of railroad marketing practices.
When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern</ENAMEX> two years ago, the railroad was running a single Roadrailer route between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, mainly to transport auto parts. His Triple Crown service has grown to as many as 14 Roadrailer trains a day on five routes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South.</ENAMEX> He plans to extend the system to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> as soon as he reaches agreement with connecting railroads. While he won't talk numbers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> says Triple Crown will turn profitable later this year.
So far, Triple Crown is impressing shippers. ``They really run a clockwork schedule,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore Hamer</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mead Corp.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> ``is much more like the trucking company executives the shippers are used to dealing with,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wilkins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>
Like Roadrailer itself, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX>'s career spans road and rail. The six-foot-four <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rutgers University</ENAMEX> economics graduate got his first trucking job in 1976, after he was ejected from a penthouse <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> restaurant for shoving a patron. As he rode the elevator down with his antagonist, a trucking terminal manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roadway Services Inc.</ENAMEX>, the man said he liked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX>'s style and hired him to supervise a loading dock.
In 1981, after a stint at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airborne Freight Corp.</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American Van Lines</ENAMEX>, since acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern</ENAMEX>, and rose to vice president, sales and marketing. He got his current job in 1987 after harshly criticizing the railroad's marketing in a company videotape.
``You talked about how things are done in the trucking industry,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Mckinnon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern</ENAMEX>'s chairman, told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX>. ``Here's your chance to implement them in the railroad industry.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> has since set up a hub outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Wayne</ENAMEX> where Roadrailer trains meet and exchange trailers. He won union concessions for smaller crews and faster schedules for Roadrailer trains. He successfully pressed his supplier, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roadrailer Division</ENAMEX> of closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duchossois Industries Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago Heights</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, to make design changes. And he hired ex-trucking salesmen at Triple Crown, preferring to go direct to customers rather than rely on the middlemen that sell most rail piggyback service -- angering the brokers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> says his own sales force will work harder to fill the costly Roadrailer trailers, which represent a big financial drain when empty.
Meanwhile, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> often takes aim at the railroad's rigid chain-of-command. ``Transportation is a dynamic business that changes all the time,'' he says. ``But the railroad bureaucracy is set up to enforce the status quo.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Southern</ENAMEX> top brass tolerates Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> -- to a point. ``Anyone who is blunt has to learn to curb their bluntness,'' says his boss, D. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Watts</ENAMEX>, executive vice president, marketing. ``It's something {Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX>} has to work on all the time.'' Even so, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watts</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> is an ``effective change agent.''
But change doesn't always come fast enough to please Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX>. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> Roadrailer train pulls past him, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> notices that the trailers' gleaming white paint jobs, integral to Triple Crown's marketing strategy, are soiled and dingy from diesel smoke. ``We painted them white for a reason,'' says an irritated Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkbiner</ENAMEX> to several aides. ``We want to tell shippers that this isn't just a dirty old train.''
The next day, soapsuds fly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and the trailers gleam again.
