Four years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> was designated the most-livable U.S. city by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rand Mcnally</ENAMEX>'s Places Rated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Almanac</ENAMEX>, and the honor did wonders to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>'s soot-stained image.
``People asked, is it really true?'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maury Kelley</ENAMEX>, vice president, marketing services, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beecham Products USA</ENAMEX>, a maker of health and personal-care products that used the ranking in its recruiting brochure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yuba City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, ranked dead last among 329 metro areas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unamused</ENAMEX>, residents burned Rand Mcnally books and wore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>-shirts that said: ``Kiss my Atlas.''
The almanac will be making new friends and enemies on Oct. 27, when an updated version will be released.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> figures it will be dethroned but plans to accept its ouster graciously. The city's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Promotion</ENAMEX> plans media events to welcome its successor.
``We're encouraging a graceful transition,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Kay Poppenberg</ENAMEX>, the organization's president. ``Our attitude is that (the ranking) is like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss America</ENAMEX>. Once you're Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">America</ENAMEX>, you're always Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">America</ENAMEX>.''
Tell that to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> replaced as the most-livable city in 1985. Many Atlantans thought <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> was an unworthy heir. A columnist in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> Journal and Constitution wrote: ``Who did the research for this report? Two guys from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>?''
Not so. Co-authors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Savageau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Boyer</ENAMEX>, live in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gloucester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asheville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, respectively. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savageau</ENAMEX> sniffs, ``has unrealistic pretensions to world-class status.''
The new edition lists the top 10 metropolitan areas as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anaheim</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Ana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nassau</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savageau</ENAMEX> says earthquake or not, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> makes the list.
But attention also rivets on who finishes last, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pine Bluff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ark.</ENAMEX> -- which finished third to last in 1981 and second to last in 1985 -- is certainly in the running.
``I hate to dignify the publication by commenting on the obscene rating,'' Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn Robinson</ENAMEX> says, adding that cities have no way to rebut the book. ``It's like fighting your way out of a fog. You don't know which way to punch.
