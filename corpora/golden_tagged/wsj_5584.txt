<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> confirmed the ratings on $8.8 billion of securities issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> as well as the bank holding company's subsidiaries.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX> hadn't been formally reviewing the ratings. The credit-rating company said, however, that it was prompted to act on the ratings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX>' plan to recapitalize, including the sale of 4.9% of the parent and 60% of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT Group</ENAMEX> finance subsidiary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
Manufacturers also plans to sell as much as $500 million of equity, and it will boost its reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries.
Selling the stakes in the parent and CIT ``will improve the corporation's financial position,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX> said. But it added that when it assigned the current ratings in February 1988, it expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> eventually would take this sort of action.
Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers ``</ENAMEX>may have to further increase its {less-developed-country} reserve... which could renew pressure'' on its regulatory capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX> said. The bank's ``key-financial indices'' -- core earnings, liquidity and asset quality'' -- have continued to improve, a trend evident for some time,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ratings</ENAMEX> confirmed include the parent's Baa-3 senior debt, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ba</ENAMEX>-2 subordinated debt, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eurobonds</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ba</ENAMEX>-3 preferred stock and prime-3 commercial paper.
The single-A-1 senior debt, single-A-2 subordinated debt, and prime-1 short-term debt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT Group Holdings</ENAMEX> remain under a review for possible upgrade that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX> announced Sept. 13.
