When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Volokh</ENAMEX> and her family immigrated to the U.S. 14 years ago, they started life in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> with only $400. They'd actually left the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> with $480, but during a stop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> dropped $80 on a black velvet suit. Not surprisingly, she quickly adapted to the American way. Three months after she arrived in L.A. she spent $120 she didn't have for a hat. (``A ``A turban,'' she specifies, ``though it wasn't the time for that 14 years ago. But I loved turbans.'')
Since then she has become wealthy. Her husband and older son -- a computer prodigy profiled in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> in 1981, when he was 13 -- run a software company with expected sales this year of $10 million. Most recently, she has become the publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Movieline</ENAMEX>, a four-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> magazine that began national distribution last month, with an initial press run of 100,000 copies. Distributed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern News</ENAMEX>, the glossy publication melds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX>'s gossipy archness and Premiere's earnest delving into behind-the-scenes minutiae, with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter. It's being sold through bookstores, newsstands and some video stores.
Though Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> is a small woman, she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that seem perfectly suited to capitalism as it is practiced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kiev</ENAMEX>, when she lived with her parents, her husband and her two sons in a 2 1\ apartment in what she calls ``silent internal immigration,'' dreaming of escape.
Now, for example, she owns 48 hats. However, she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that turban10 years later and having a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel. With obvious satisfaction, she says she told him: ``No darling, I just give it a Chanel look.'' She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox.
Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona, along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes she smokes, the parties she throws for 500 people, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chekovian</ENAMEX> feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX>?
``No, darling,'' she said recently in her fluent, slightly affected English, during a trip East to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Movieline</ENAMEX>'s national expansion. ``You have to be born with it. I used to wear hats in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>, but I had to make them and my dresses. On the hat side I wasn't getting what I wanted.''
Now 48 years old, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> has definite ideas about what she wants. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Movieline</ENAMEX>, she wants ``specific paragraphing, specific tone, a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek.'' In restaurants (in this case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russian Samovar</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres), she didn't want the chirpy, folkish music bouncing through the room. ``You people here think this is Russian music,'' she said with disdain, and called over to the waitress: ``Could you turn it off?''
That done, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with: an understanding of food, business, Russian culture, human nature, and parties. ``Parties are rather a state of mind,'' she said, pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik ([``a ``a]* little well done, but very good''). ``If you are born to give parties, you give parties. Even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> we managed to give parties. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, in our lean years, we gave parties.''
As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> sees her party-giving as an important part of business. She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people, but prefers more intimate gatherings. ``At American cocktail parties everyone's always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next. I like rather tea, because it is at the end of the day.'' She serves high Russian tea, at 5 p.m. ``It's supposed to be later but I just moved it. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, it's important to catch people just after work.''
She also frequently invites directors, producers, actors, writers and other show business people for ``coffee and clips in the pleasure dome.'' Guests bring movies on tape, and show their favorite three-to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volokhs</ENAMEX>' art-nouveau library (``the pleasure dome''). They eat ``sinful and sensual things'' -- and explain their clips. ``It's very revealing and soul baring,'' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX>.
The idea for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Movieline</ENAMEX> actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Volokhs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Krutchensky</ENAMEX> (who has the title of co-publisher), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurie Halpern Smith</ENAMEX>, now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX>'s co-editor. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krutchensky</ENAMEX> approached Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> five years ago about backing the publication, which started out as a listing guide. She was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne</ENAMEX> doesn't believe in blandness,'' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>. ``She wants things to be exciting. And she has this inexhaustible energy. She'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible, then she'll have us make it work.''
In fact, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> wasn't just a rich lady who needed a hobby. Back in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> she was a respected journalist, writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia. Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook, ``The Art of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russian</ENAMEX> Cuisine,'' brought out in 1983 by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan Publishing Co.</ENAMEX>
``I don't trust people who don't eat,'' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX>, though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds. ``Look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dostoevski</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kafka</ENAMEX>. No one ever eats in their books and look at them.... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tolstoy</ENAMEX>'s characters eat, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pushkin</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gogol</ENAMEX>'s.'' In her cookbook, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macmillan</ENAMEX> is bringing out in soft cover this month (with the blini recipe revised so it works), she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pushkin</ENAMEX> on blini, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goncharov</ENAMEX> on piroghi. In life, she offers practical dieting advice: ``Divide your meals into important and unimportant. In a great restaurant, don't deprive yourself. The other meals don't matter.''
Amusing as she is, and frivolous as she can seem, this is a serious person with some difficult memories. She was the child of relative privilege. Her mother was a translator; her father was ``the eternal vice director.''
``I emigrated to wear better hats, do better parties,'' she said with a giggle. ``But we shouldn't leave out political reasons, number one. You try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances. One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives.''
By 1973, after their second child was born, it had become clear to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> and her husband <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vladimir</ENAMEX>, a computer scientist, that they wanted to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> quit her job, to remove herself from the public eye. The wait was miserable. Before granting Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX>'s parents a visa, the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband, whom she had divorced 38 years earlier.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> was fired from his job, and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers, accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volokhs</ENAMEX> were afraid that they'd end up like a friend of theirs who'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years, having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk.
They didn't. Their visa came in relatively short order, and they moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> soon found work in his field, but Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX> refused the obvious and available occupation-as translatorfor a Russian who spoke fluent English. ``That's always looking back,'' she said. ``I wanted to be in business.'' On the way to that goal, she received her first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry, attended secretarial school, then went to work for a fund-raising organization. Soon she was running the office.
When her husband and son founded their computer company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesoft</ENAMEX>, she worked as business manager, bookkeeper and publicist. Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Movieline</ENAMEX> is located in the same building as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vesoft</ENAMEX>. ``Things work out unexpectedly in life,'' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Volokh</ENAMEX>. ``You never know if you'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one. We were lucky.
