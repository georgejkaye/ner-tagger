<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Sandner</ENAMEX> received investment income from one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX>'s most active broker groups while serving on a ``blue-ribbon'' panel that was convened this year to recommend rule changes affecting Merc floor broker groups and others.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>, a six-time former chairman of the Merc, currently holds the title of senior policy adviser at the exchange. He was one of nine people the Merc appointed in late January to review possible rule changes in the wake of the federal investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>'s trading pits, including possible steps to curtail activities of broker groups.
Nevertheless, just a few weeks later, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> elected to begin receiving payments in connection with an investment in the broker group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS Partners</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> member familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS Partners</ENAMEX> estimated Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s income from the group at between $50,000 and $100,000 annually.
Four members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS</ENAMEX> were widely known among Merc members to be targets of the federal investigation of futures trading in March, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> decided to begin receiving income from the group. The four were indicted in August on criminal fraud charges and subsequently pleaded innocent.
The apparent conflict between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s investment and his role on the special panel could stir controversy. The Merc set up the panel to head off outside reform efforts. But if the panel's findings are impugned, regulators could take a tougher stance.
The disclosure of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s investment also highlights the potential for conflict between self-regulation in the futures industry and the self-interest of prominent members.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fowler West</ENAMEX> declined to comment on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> but said: ``It's in the interest of the self-regulator to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> is the federal regulator of the futures markets.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>, who also sits on the executive committee of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX>'s board, confirmed his investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ABS</ENAMEX> but denied any conflict. In an interview, he described his decision in March to take his share of the ABS profit as a ``good business decision'' while maintaining that his portion of the group's income was ``negligible.'' He declined to elaborate.
Merc <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior</ENAMEX> Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Beyer</ENAMEX> said the exchange didn't see anything wrong with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> receiving income from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS Partners</ENAMEX> while serving on the committee that would make recommendations to the full board. ``A conflict of interest standard for a committee giving us advice isn't a relevant standard,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beyer</ENAMEX> said he became aware of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ABS</ENAMEX> shortly after it was included in Merc regulatory filings March 13.
When the special panel reported its recommendations April 19, some in the industry expressed surprise that tougher restrictions against broker groups weren't included. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> board later approved the panel's findings.
Broker groups began forming rapidly on the floors of futures exchanges in the early 1980s. Most groups allow members to share certain profits and expenses as well as to pool the risk of trading losses caused by the increasing volume of orders and price volatility in financial futures markets.
The federal investigation of futures trading fraud, which so far has led to fraud charges against 45 traders and one clerk on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX>, has led industry critics here and on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> to call for tougher oversight of the lightly regulated futures industry.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> is president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RB&H Inc.</ENAMEX>, a Merc clearing member firm that receives thousands of dollars monthly for processing trades for a number of brokers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS Partners</ENAMEX>. He is also a friend of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kaulentis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maury Kravitz</ENAMEX>, two Merc members who own 51% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS Partners</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravitz</ENAMEX> rents office space from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> and is a former officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RB&H.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaulentis</ENAMEX> a few years ago pledged to pay $350,000 for a house in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> suburb that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> was having trouble selling.
In the interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> confirmed that the company that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RB&H</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> holding company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">F. Michael Geddes</ENAMEX>, bought 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS Partners</ENAMEX> in early 1988. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> in turn owns 10% of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geddes</ENAMEX>'s company.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> said he initially decided not to receive any income from the company's investment in the broker group. A year later, he had a change of heart. ``Eventually, I looked at the numbers from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ABS</ENAMEX>. I told myself,'I'm  only not doing this because of what someone might say about me,''' he said.
His 1988 indirect interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS</ENAMEX> wasn't disclosed in Merc regulatory filings. He appeared as an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ABS</ENAMEX> investor for the first time in March, when he started receiving income.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> receives $150,000 annually for being Merc senior policy adviser. His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RB&H</ENAMEX> compensation isn't disclosed.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> denied that his decision in March to start receiving profit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABS Partners</ENAMEX> affected his thinking about broker groups.
``I would never allow any interest I have to influence my thinking on an issue,'' he said. He also said that testimony before the Merc panel last spring from futures industry members was ``overwhelmingly positive for broker groups.''
Proponents of broker groups argue that they are better able than independent brokers to serve big institutional customers that trade in several futures contracts a day. Critics say the broker groups have too much control over the flow of orders in certain Merc trading pits. Current Merc rules restrict the amount of trading that group members can do with each other.
Most of the major recommendations from the Merc panel -- such as limits on dual trading by brokers for their own and customers' accounts, having non-members serve on exchange disciplinary committees and toughening exchange sanctions -- were adopted or slightly modified and approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> board in August. But they aren't likely to take effect until two bills in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> regarding the reauthorization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> are passed.
In addition to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>, the Merc panel comprised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Melamed</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX>'s executive committee; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T. Geldermann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> chairman; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brodsky</ENAMEX>, president of the Merc; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Phillips</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> governor and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> chairman; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas F. Eagleton</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> senator from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> and a Merc director; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Margolis</ENAMEX>, managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> and an exchange governor; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Butler</ENAMEX>, governor and former president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cattlemen's Association</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John A. Wing</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Corp.</ENAMEX>
This isn't the first time that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> has found himself at the center of controversy. While he was head of the central region's business conduct committee of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Futures Association</ENAMEX>, an industry group overseeing sales practices, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s firm hired a dozen salesmen from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Commodity Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Commodity's Boston</ENAMEX> headquarters had been raided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in late 1986 during Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s tenure as Merc chairman.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> folded his retail operation in early January of this year. Less than two weeks later, 16 former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Commodity salesmen</ENAMEX>, including some who had worked for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>, were indicted here on federal fraud charges related to activities at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Commodity.</ENAMEX> They pleaded not guilty; their case hasn't gone to trial. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> wasn't implicated in the federal charges.
In 1987, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s firm allowed two salesmen to become affiliated with it who had been accused of fraudulent trading. Last year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> filed charges against the salesmen, their former employer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP Commodities Inc.</ENAMEX> and its chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Monieson</ENAMEX> -- also a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> chairman -- related to the fraud allegations. Those CFTC charges are still pending.
Shortly after folding the retail operation, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> said he regretted not being more involved in hiring and reviewing his salesmen's activities.
