The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> proposed fining Pan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American World Airways</ENAMEX> $630,000 for alleged security violations involving six flights, including Flight 103, which crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in what investigators believe was a terrorist bombing.
The infractions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said, involved security breaches in the methods used to screen passengers and baggage before the boarding of flights at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heathrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> airports.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> didn't charge that the lapses contributed to the Dec. 21, 1988, disaster over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, in which 270 people were killed. However, a criminal investigation into the disaster, involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Investigation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">European</ENAMEX> authorities, is continuing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am Corp.</ENAMEX>, must respond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> within 30 days. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Plaskett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, portrayed the alleged breaches as being ``of an administrative, rather than substantive, nature.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Privately</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> senior officials scoffed at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plaskett</ENAMEX>'s description. ``They don't look like administrative violations to me,'' one official said.
Investigators believe that Flight 103, which took off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heathrow</ENAMEX> en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, blew apart after the detonation of a bomb disguised as a radio-cassette recorder. The device apparently was put aboard in a suitcase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, where the flight originated. A leading suspect in the case is a terrorist group known as the Popular Front for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberation of Palestine-General Command</ENAMEX>, according to investigators.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> investigation began the day after the bombing, and ended Jan. 31, 1989. The agency said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> has since corrected the security problems.
In proposing the $630,000 fine, the aviation agency said a number of violations involved Flight 103. For example, 31 passengers at Heathrow fit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s profile of people who should have been screened more than once before boarding. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> failed to identify the passengers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said, and thus didn't conduct the required additional screening of them or their baggage.
Similarly, five people who boarded the flight in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> should have been screened more than once, the agency said. Another five people got off the plane in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> because one of the passengers was sick, but their checked baggage wasn't taken off the flight.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> also was cited for security violations involving three other flights at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heathrow</ENAMEX> and two more at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, including the improper screening of carry-on luggage and the alleged failure to search an aircraft's cargo area. The proposed fine includes $480,000 for violations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and $150,000 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>.
Separately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> passed legislation authorizing $100 million from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Trust Fund</ENAMEX> for the purchase and installation of devices to detect explosives at high-risk airports. The legislation also authorizes $170 million for airports to set up computer-controlled access systems to better guard secured areas.
Last month, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> issued a rule requiring U.S. airlines to install bomb-detection machines to screen checked luggage at about 40 airports in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and abroad. Although the agency didn't specify which detection systems the airlines must use, it strongly endorsed thermal neutron analysis devices, which detect nitrogen compounds found in explosives.
