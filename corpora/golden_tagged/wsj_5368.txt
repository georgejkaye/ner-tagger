In spite of their own opposition to the plan, governors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Securities Dealers Inc.</ENAMEX> agreed to observe a system of marketwide trading halts in certain situations for one more year.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASD</ENAMEX> oversees the over-the-counter stock market.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASD</ENAMEX> continues to believe,'' said its president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph R. Hardiman</ENAMEX>, ``that individual markets, in cooperation with other markets and federal regulators, should be free to make a determination of whether to close based on the character of a particular emergency.''
The plan of establishing ``circuit breakers'' to close U.S. securities markets in case of extreme price volatility was developed in response to the Oct. 19, 1987, market crash, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average fell 538 points, or 22.6%, and most equities markets around the world suffered similar losses.
``In the spirit of intermarket cooperation,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASD</ENAMEX> said it agreed to abide by ``circuit-breaker'' procedures put in place by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> until Oct. 31, 1990.
