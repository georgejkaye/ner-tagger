<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H Corp.</ENAMEX>, formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fruehauf Corp.</ENAMEX>, said it won't pay the regular quarterly in-kind dividend on its $3.68 Series A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cumulative Exchangeable Redeemable</ENAMEX> Preferred Stock on Saturday.
The auto-parts maker said because of a ``substantial deficiency in book value,'' it believes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> corporate law forbids it from paying a dividend. This is the second consecutive quarter that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K-H</ENAMEX> hasn't declared and distributed a dividend.
