More than six months after he was confirmed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Services</ENAMEX>, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Sullivan</ENAMEX> may finally be about to emerge from ideological ambivalence.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>, a hematologist who helped found and was the first president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morehouse School of Medicine</ENAMEX>, has been a symbol of Republican concern for minorities and the poor. But while regarded as intelligent and sincere, he has not earned a reputation as a strong manager or an agenda-setter, and his political instincts are weak.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mosbacher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> and drug czar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bennett</ENAMEX> have been outspoken on issues and influential in the halls of government, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> has been traveling around the country bringing a message of hope to his health and welfare constituents. But his busy travel and speaking schedule has made it difficult even for members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to meet with him.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s selection to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Services</ENAMEX> was greeted with satisfaction by generally liberal groups. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Association of Retired</ENAMEX> Persons (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AARP</ENAMEX>), for example, ``welcomed'' his nomination and spoke of the ``admirable selection'' in a December press release.
Conservative leaders, on the other hand, were initially skeptical about Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> because he didn't have the correct ideological credentials. They were quickly angered by a newspaper report that suggested he not only lacked the commitment to the pro-life cause, but actually opposed the president's position on the issue.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> immediately disavowed the newspaper story and stated that his views and the president's were identical on abortion. After that, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> made a conscious decision to neutralize criticism from the right by appointing conservatives to posts in the department.
Undersecretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constance Horner</ENAMEX>, the number two person in the department, is a loyalist veteran of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan Administration</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay James</ENAMEX>, the assistant secretary for public affairs, formerly served with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Right</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Committee</ENAMEX> and is a favorite with conservatives. Both were selected with an eye to conservatives, as was the lower level appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Fagan</ENAMEX> as a deputy assistant secretary.
But while Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> tabbed some conservatives to his department, he has also sought to fill key slots, such as the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HCFA</ENAMEX>) which handles Medicare and Medicaid, and the assistant secretary for family support, the top welfare position in government, with candidates who were opposed by (and ultimately quashed with the help of) conservatives.
This has meant that decisions are made within the depths of the bureaucracy. Given a department staffed by professionals who view the department's role as expanding ``rights'' and government guarantees, as well as spending more money on government programs, it would be surprising if, barring a different vision from the secretary and his top assistants, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> didn't follow its traditional role of government activism.
``In too many instances a career person {rather than a political appointee} is making the day-to-day decisions, and that's not likely to be good from the point of implementing the policies that the Bush administration would like,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bauer</ENAMEX>, president of the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Research Council</ENAMEX>.
The vacancies have aroused concern even from liberals, who complain that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> doesn't have a strong enough voice in the administration.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Greenstein</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</ENAMEX>, a non-profit group that focuses on policies affecting low income people, calls proposed regulations to implement the new welfare reform law ``among the most poorly designed I've ever seen,'' and he blames them on the lack of a strong assistant secretary in charge of welfare matters. ``The vacancies are resulting in severe policy problems which wouldn't have occurred if Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> had been allowed to {fill vacancies with} his choices.''
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> wasn't available for comment, but there are reasons to believe that he'll become more outspoken on controversial issues and that he'll soon begin to make his mark on the department. Veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> insider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Calhoun</ENAMEX> has been hired as his chief of staff, and the secretary's attention to policy and the political process is likely to increase. That should mean a more specific agenda and greater sensitivity to the concerns of opinionmakers.
The key question is whether conservatives or liberals will be generally pleased with Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s increased visibility. The secretary recently testified before Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>) Labor and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Resources Committee</ENAMEX>, praising the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democrat</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disadvantaged</ENAMEX> Minority Health Improvement Act of 1989'' and promising support for Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>'s proposals. In the same testimony, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> identified youth homicide as ``a public health priority.''
The department also seems on its way to accepting the ``relative value scale for physician reimbursement,'' essentially a non-market, wage and price system approach to physician payment under Medicare that has the support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AMA</ENAMEX>. And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> have failed to use elderly opposition to the new catastrophic-illness program to justify a reexamination of the law's drug benefit provision, which has been a major factor in the revised estimates of the programs's cost.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>'s selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Gerry</ENAMEX> to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planning and Evaluation Division</ENAMEX> has some conservatives worried, primarily because they know little about him. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry</ENAMEX> is a disability lawyer who served in the department's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office for Civil Rights</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon Administration</ENAMEX> (when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> was still <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health, Education</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welfare</ENAMEX>).
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> has walked an ideological tightrope in his first months by carefully balancing appointments in the department and by dealing with general concerns rather than specific policy questions. But the secretary is likely to find that as he involves himself more in policy, he is going to have to take ideological sides.
One upcoming litmus test for social-issue conservatives will involve fetal experimentation. They see fetal experimentation as part of the overall abortion debate. ``For pro-life forces, fetal experimentation is the next major issue and a key test for Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX>. He should not be dissuaded by sophists attempting to cloud the issue,'' argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Moffitt</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> official in the Reagan administration.
To date, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> has left less of a mark on his department than had several of his recent predecessors, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otis Bowen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Schweicker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Califano</ENAMEX>, by this point in their terms. But more recent events suggest he may be positioning himself as the point man for a ``kinder and gentler'' Bush administration. And it may not be the sort of kindness and gentleness that conservatives will reward.
