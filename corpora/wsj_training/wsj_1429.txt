In a blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rafale</ENAMEX> jet fighter, the French navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy 15 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> F-18 Hornets to defend its aircraft carriers.
The statement is likely to sharpen the debate within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s military establishment over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rafale</ENAMEX>, which is made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA</ENAMEX>.
In an interview in the navy's official weekly magazine Cols <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bleus</ENAMEX>, the navy's second-in-command, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yves Goupil</ENAMEX>, said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century. The air force is to take at least 250 more.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said the navy can't wait until 1998, when the naval Rafale becomes available, to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders, used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack. Rather than renovate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusaders</ENAMEX>, which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ($286.6 million), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said the navy wants to buy used F-18s from the U.S. Navy.
Officially, the statement isn't an attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rafale</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> said that when the F-18s wear out, the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them. But unofficially, senior navy officials sharply criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rafale</ENAMEX> as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use. Although they never said so publicly, they have made no secret of their preference for the F-18 on operational grounds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX>'s comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dassault</ENAMEX>. Although government-controlled, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dassault</ENAMEX> still is run by the founder's son, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Serge Dassault</ENAMEX>, who has fiercely protected his company's independence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rafale</ENAMEX> project is the result of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries, and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs. So far, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dassault</ENAMEX> has resisted pressure to change.
What brought the naval issue to a head is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusaders</ENAMEX> are literally falling apart, without any immediate plan to replace them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusader</ENAMEX> squadron leader, said that the last other country to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusaders</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>, retired its last ones two years ago. A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goupil</ENAMEX> rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dassault</ENAMEX>'s proposal to renovate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusaders</ENAMEX>, saying the cost was impossible to estimate. Even modernized, he said, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusaders</ENAMEX> represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> has sent to meet such crises as the wars in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Pierre Chevenement</ENAMEX> told a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Press Association</ENAMEX> that the question of modernizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crusaders</ENAMEX> or buying used <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">F18s</ENAMEX> is a ``political'' decision that he will make in due time.
