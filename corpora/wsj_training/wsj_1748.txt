<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal Corp.</ENAMEX> said it signed a definitive agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aruba</ENAMEX> to restart a 150,000-barrel-a-day oil refinery. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal</ENAMEX> wouldn't disclose the terms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> oil and gas company, said it expects to begin operations in October 1990. The company said it may install additional processing units at the refinery to produce higher octane gasolines and other products.
The company said it was leasing the site of the refinery from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aruba</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors, from whom Coastal bought back much of the equipment.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal</ENAMEX> spokesman said the biggest expense will be to refurbish the refinery but wouldn't say how much that would be. The prime minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aruba</ENAMEX> has said it could cost around $100 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal</ENAMEX> said the refinery's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel, 32,000 barrels of low-sulfur diesel fuel, 30,000 barrels of naphtha, 17,000 barrels of residual fuel oil, 8,000 barrels of asphalt and 25,000 barrels of low-sulfur catalytic cracker feedstock.
