<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burroughs-Wellcome Co.</ENAMEX>, bowing to pressure from patients and their advocates, announced a 20% price cut in its antiviral drug AZT for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
AIDS activists, who have been lobbying for a price cut for months, gave the move muted praise. It is ``a small step in the right direction,'' said one.
The price cut, which follows an earlier price reduction of 20% in Dec. 1987, effectively reduces <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s retail price to $6,400 from $8,000 a year per patient. But recent studies suggest that the drug may be effective at 40% or 50% of the original dose, which could further reduce the cost to patients to about $3,000.
In the end, it wasn't consumer pressure alone but anticipated growth in its market that brought the change. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s market is expected to mushroom due to findings that the drug slows the onset of AIDS in people infected with the AIDS virus but not yet showing any symptoms of disease. That suggests the drug will be useful to hundreds of thousands of infected people, in addition to the tens of thousands of patients with AIDS symptoms.
The company's stock surged 32% in mid-August when those findings were announced, and analysts have projected that a broadened market for the drug could boost AZT sales to $1 billion by 1992. The company, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Research Triangle Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
``We're pleased to see the price lowered,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mervyn Silverman</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Foundation</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDS Research</ENAMEX>. ``But to be fair and to put AZT within reach of most people with AIDS {and its related infection}, the price needs to be reduced much further.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burroughs-Wellcome</ENAMEX> long resisted pressure and pleas for a price cut, citing the burden of ongoing research and doubts about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s useful product life. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.E. Haigler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jr.</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer, said yesterday, ``The expected growth in patient population, coupled with recent production economies, will reduce somewhat our financial risk and will remove some of the uncertainties which existed when this drug was first introduced.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haigler</ENAMEX> added that the company, in its calculations, also had to consider the health of the corporation and the value of the stock to shareholders.
Reactions to the price cut, while favorable, were heavily qualified, and hinted at continued public scrutiny of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX>.
``We know their market is expanding exponentially, so we feel a further reduction is warranted. Their stock is rising, so we know their profit margins aren't in jeopardy. But what is in jeopardy is the life and health of many people,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Sweeney</ENAMEX>, acting executive director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gay Men's Health Crisis</ENAMEX>, a support group in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
``The company can do better,'' agreed Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Waxman</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>), who held hearings on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s price when it was introduced in 1987. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX>'s cost of production is clearly lower, and its market is clearly larger. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has the responsibility to ensure that this life-saving drug is available to everyone -- through federal insurance to the poor, and through a reasonable price to all.''
So far, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government has loomed large as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s biggest single purchaser, with $320 million in subsidies to patients through its Medicaid program and federal grants for the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>. That cost is expected to increase as earlier treatment of the infected population begins, a program that could run as high as $5 billion to $10 billion in public and private outlays, according to an article in the current issue of the Journal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical Association</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waxman</ENAMEX>, meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX> executives yesterday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, again pressed the company to disclose details of its development costs and threatened to reopen hearings into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s price -- notwithstanding yesterday's cut -- if he believes the company is reaping too high a rate of return.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Activists</ENAMEX> said they will continue to pursue their inquiries into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX>. ``It's a good start. But we'll continue to look at a possible challenge of the company's patent,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Barr</ENAMEX>, an attorney with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambda Legal Defense Fund</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> public interest firm specializing in gay rights issues.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>, originally created in 1964 by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Horwitz</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Cancer Foundation</ENAMEX> with federal grant funding, was developed in close collaboration with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>, a unit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX> financed clinical trials and conducted tests of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s toxicology and pharmacology; that the company stood on so many shoulders in making the product further heated up the pricing debate.
The compound itself has been in the public domain for more than two decades, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX> holds a so-called ``use patent'' for treating AIDS. In addition, the company has claimed broad title to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s use in infections by other ``retroviruses,'' a class of viruses encompassing AIDS which are linked by their habit of transmitting genetic information in a backwards flow from RNA to DNA. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s potential use in retroviruses was first published by West German researchers in 1974, a quirk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s history likely to be exploited in any assault on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX>'s patent.
The controversy over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>'s price prompted government lawyers to consider a range of potential remedies, from price controls to government manufacture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AZT</ENAMEX>, and sparked re-examination of an old statute enabling the U.S. to invite patent infringement when federal procurement of a strategic product was threatened by activities of a single supplier.
The uproar also inspired a ``reasonable price'' clause that now is inserted into all technology licensing agreements between the government and companies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, many experts believe moderation of AIDS-drug prices will be brought about by competition between many drugs and pharmaceutical companies. Real market competition is still months away, however.
One of the earliest sources of such competition may be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDI</ENAMEX>, a related compound patented by the cancer institute and licensed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bristol-Myers Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDI</ENAMEX> has passed safety tests and now is entering tests of effectiveness needed for market approval. But the company already has pledged to distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDI</ENAMEX> to patients in critical need even as such tests proceed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> is expected to approve such a giveaway shortly, by designating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDI</ENAMEX> a ``treatment I.N.D.,'' or investigational new drug, some time this week.
``I really think the answer from everybody's point of view is going to be having lots of effective agents in the hands of lots of competing companies,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Broder</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Cancer Institute</ENAMEX>. ``Until then, we never will have a solution satisfactory to everybody. You run a better race when you have a competitor.
