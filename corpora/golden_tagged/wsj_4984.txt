Savings and loan officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> sold the deposit accounts of three sick thrifts and liquidated another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB Texas National Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB North Carolina National Bank</ENAMEX>, continued its expansion into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> markets, where it has already acquired three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&Ls</ENAMEX>, with the purchase of deposit accounts of two sick <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> thrifts. It acquired the deposits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Capital Savings Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>, with $79.7 million in assets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> will pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> a premium of $500,000 for $123.3 million in deposits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB Texas</ENAMEX> also acquired $159.1 million in deposits from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Village Savings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>, which had $113.9 million in assets. It will pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> a premium of $1.2 million for the deposits.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> also sold the deposits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colonial Savings Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liberal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>, with $62.6 million in assets, to Garden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garden City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan</ENAMEX>. The deposits total $61.2 million, in 4,700 accounts. The Garden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bank</ENAMEX> is paying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> a premium of $104,000 for the transferred deposits.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> found no acceptable bidders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unified Savings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, which had $34.5 million in assets, and so is paying depositors the amount of their accounts for a maximum of $100,000, the federal insurance limit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unified Savings</ENAMEX> had $49.6 million in only 600 deposit accounts -- an indication that most of its deposits were in $100,000 ``brokered'' accounts, which follow small increases in interest rates. Such deposit bases aren't desirable for buyers of thrifts, who are often seeking depositors as new customers for mortgages and other financial products.
Under the terms of the deposit transfer deals, the buyer pays a premium to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> to take control of the deposit accounts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> sells the assets, often real estate, separately. Buyers, however, will have the first option to acquire the assets, usually loans or real estate.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> is the new government agency established to manage and sell insolvent thrifts and their assets under the savings and loan law approved a month ago.
