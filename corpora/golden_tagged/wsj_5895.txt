<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates International Inc.</ENAMEX> fired about 900 people at its recently acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet Software Inc.</ENAMEX>, cutting swiftly and more deeply than most analysts had expected, former employees said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garden City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX>, which has earned a reputation for quickly slashing costs at its acquisitions, couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. Calls to the company on Friday weren't returned. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX> has indicated that there would be layoffs, but hasn't disclosed the extent of the cutbacks.
Three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX> managers who were terminated last week said the unexpectedly deep cuts were likely to disrupt customer service and derail product development. They said many seminar instructors for an annual customer meeting scheduled next week in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> had been among those fired. About half of the company's applications product development staff also were let go, former employees said.
Still, with expenses slashed, the business could quickly become profitable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX> has recurring license revenue of about $100 million a year from its large, captive base of customers who use its data-base management software on mainframe computers, according to a report by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Smith</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sources</ENAMEX> said that severance and related payments were expected to cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> $30 million, including $10 million in payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX> executives who weren't retained in the buy-out. Analysts had predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> would cut as much as 40% of the work force, which stood at 1,810 employees as of April 30.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX> shareholders voted last week to accept the bid, which had been valued at about $300 million. In the transaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> agreed to pay one-half of a share of its stock for each of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX>'s approximately 36 million common shares outstanding.
The acquisition, which was announced in June, brought the end of a software-industry pioneer. Twenty-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullinet</ENAMEX>, once a star of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>'s Route 128 region, was the first software firm listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and was among the first to bring off-the-shelf software to market. Previously, most companies wrote software programs in-house.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westwood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX> fell behind in a fast-moving software market. The company reported its first profit in three years, $2.2 million, in the fourth quarter ended April 30. Revenue fell 7.7% to $59.3 million. Revenue for the full year -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX>'s last year as an independent company -- was $203 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> closed on Friday at $17.50 a share in national over-the-counter trading, with 1.4 million shares changing hands.
