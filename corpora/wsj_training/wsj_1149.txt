The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sentelle</ENAMEX> recently called a ``monster.'' Needless to say, he was talking about RICO. With its recently revised guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICO</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors.
The text of the ``new policy'' guidelines from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal Division</ENAMEX> are reprinted nearby. They strongly suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice's</ENAMEX> prosecutions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton/Newport</ENAMEX> violated notions of fundamental fairness. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justice</ENAMEX> is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics. This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX>, who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets.
The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of Ricoed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others. This follows earlier new guidelines from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Division</ENAMEX> prohibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton/Newport</ENAMEX>-like tax cases from masquerading as RICO cases. The forfeiture memo cited ``considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process.'' It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are ``less intrusive'' alternatives, such as bonds, and in any case not to seek forfeitures ``disproportionate to the defendant's crime.''
These changes come a tad late for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton/Newport</ENAMEX>, the first Ricoed securities firm. It was forced into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton/Newport</ENAMEX> investors, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mckinsey & Co.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard endowment</ENAMEX>, made the rational decision to withdraw their money; for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later. Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000.
The experience of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Princeton/Newport</ENAMEX> and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> that a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ricoed</ENAMEX> investment bank would be an ex-investment bank. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges ``which the company is not in a position to dispute'' because of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">RICO</ENAMEX>. Part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s plea was to cut Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX> loose. So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what, if anything, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> did wrong.
So two cheers for the new rules. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justice</ENAMEX> has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> Joseph digenova, who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals.
But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sentelle</ENAMEX>, of the appeals court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, made this point at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cato Institute</ENAMEX> conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">RICO</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monster</ENAMEX> That Ate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jurisprudence</ENAMEX>.'' He said ours is supposed to be ``a government of laws not of men,'' and yet RICO defenders ``tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICO</ENAMEX>.'' No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages.
What now for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>\ officials, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justice</ENAMEX> should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred. We suspect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> will some day agree that only the complete repeal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICO</ENAMEX> can guarantee an end to injustices in its name.
