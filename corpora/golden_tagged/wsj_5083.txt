Another financier is getting into the French luxury-goods business.
The head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Bressler</ENAMEX>, says he is stepping down to become full-time chairman of the financially troubled Lanvin fashion and perfume house. He will be succeeded at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> banking unit by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude-Eric Paquin</ENAMEX>, his deputy.
Although he hasn't any prior experience in the business, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX> says he was ``seduced'' by the fashion world after arranging last March for Midland to take a 40% stake in the prestigious old house.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financiers</ENAMEX> already have heavy investments in French fashion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Arnault</ENAMEX> controls the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dior</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian Lacroix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LVMH Moet Hennessy</ENAMEX> Louis Vuitton luxury groups. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo De Benedetti</ENAMEX> has a substantial minority stake in Yves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Laurent</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alain Chevalier</ENAMEX>, deposed chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moet Vuitton</ENAMEX>, is negotiating the purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Balmain</ENAMEX> house.
Unlike them, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX> isn't putting any of his own money into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX>. It remains controlled by the bank and by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX> family, which retains a 60% stake. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>'s share could rise if Lanvin boosts its capital later.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX>, a 42-year-old French citizen, wouldn't rule out an eventual buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX>, permitting Midland to take a profit and leaving him or another investor as owner. For now, however, he says the priority is to return the maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arpege</ENAMEX> perfume and classic French clothing to profitability. He forecast a loss of 60 million French francs ($9.1 million) for this year, following last year's loss of more than 100 million francs on revenue of 250 million francs. About half of the two losses are from restructuring costs, he says.
Turning the company around won't be easy, he acknowledges. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX> was shopped around and rejected by just about every other fashion house and luxury investor available before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX> became interested late last year, he says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland</ENAMEX> didn't have any loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX> says, but saw an investment opportunity. ``Most of the others looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX> as a luxury company. We looked at them for their breakup value,'' he says. ``They had a great series of real estate holdings.''
He won't say what Midland paid for its 40% stake, but the bank persuaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX> family to let it run the business.
After the investment became final, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX> sold the choicest real estate, a historic building near the Arc <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Triomphe</ENAMEX>, for 260 million francs to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi group</ENAMEX>. That wiped out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX>'s 200 million franc debt and should cover this year's loss, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX>. He hopes to break even next year and post profits after that.
He is reorganizing management -- including moving family members out of key management slots -- and cutting staff by 80, to 400. Sources say he is negotiating with such designers as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giorgio</ENAMEX> Armani to take over and pep up the women's high fashion collection. He also is planning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arpege</ENAMEX>'s first big publicity campaign in a decade.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX> makes 150 million francs a year on fashion, mostly from license fees from ready-to-wear houses that use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX> name on their clothing. Sources say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX> hopes to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX>'s own sales of both perfume and fashions. He is expected to create new lines of luxury goods, such as bags, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX> will make itself rather than license. Sources say he will expand the franchised and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lanvin</ENAMEX>-owned boutiques to 50 world-wide over the next five years, from about 20.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bressler</ENAMEX> remains a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> unit's board and an adviser to the parent.
