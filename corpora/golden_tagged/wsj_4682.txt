<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> moved to grab a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX> to head off an imminent deal in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> was seeking to buy 30% of the British auto maker.
Top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> executives met during the weekend of Sept. 16 and 17, and the agreement to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> stake was a key item on the agenda, say individuals familiar with the unusual session. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, though, got wind of the pending pact between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> and two days later -- Sept. 19 -- announced that it was seeking to buy 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s shares on the open market. The unwelcome move angered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> officials and put the pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> pact on hold.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> now are reassessing their options, say people close to the situation. Those individuals add that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> may soon announce some sort of agreement in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> will take a significant stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> executives, in explaining their ``preemptive strike'' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares, previously said they were reacting to an anticipated bid for all or part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>. It wasn't previously known, however, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> were on the verge of announcing an agreement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> to take a 30% stake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, the world's two largest auto makers, clash every day in the car and truck market, but rarely over acquisitions. The last such instance occurred in 1985, when the two companies were rival bidders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Aircraft Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> won by entering a complex bid valued at just above $5 billion, about $1 billion more than Ford was willing to pay.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> believe that the allure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> name, as well as the distinctiveness of its cars, would make a linkup with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> worthwhile. Top planners at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>, it's understood, recommended some time ago that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> purchase of all or part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> would help diversify the company's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares topped the most active list in the U.S. national over-the-counter market yesterday, with almost 2.2 million shares changing hands. But the price dropped slightly -- to $8.84 bid, down 44 cents -- apparently because investors believe the price ran up too far after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s Sept. 19 announcement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> already has purchased just over 1% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares, and must wait until the middle of next month to receive U.S. regulatory clearance to buy its 15% goal. The British government has a ``supervote'' share that prevents any buyer from purchasing more than 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s stock, without that government's approval before the end of 1990.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s once-troubled European operations have produced a sharp turnaround in the past two years, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> is eager to continue its momentum in the marketplace there. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Opel</ENAMEX> marque has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models, but it doesn't have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s highbrow appeal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials, for their part, also have long coveted a link with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>, which explains their ``preemptive strike'' strategy despite their traditional disdain for anything resembling a hostile takeover. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, whose European operations also are doing well, is also discussing possible links with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab-Scania AB</ENAMEX>, but it's clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> is closer to its heart.
``I'd much rather pull up to the office in the morning driving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>,'' one top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> executive confided recently. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX>'s cars are dowdy; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s are exciting.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> does have considerable problems, including the lack of financial resources to develop new cars. It has launched only one totally new car in this decade. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> apparently believe that they could provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> with the financial resources to develop cars that would capitalize on the lure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> brand name.
Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> reported a plunge in first-half pretax profit # 1.4 million ($2.2 million) from # 22.5 million.
The risk for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, though, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> may find itself overwhelmed by the new Japanese luxury cars. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> entered the luxury-car field with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acura</ENAMEX> division three years ago, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> plan to launch their luxury marques -- Lexus and Infiniti -- this fall.
