(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FRANKLIN NATIONAL BANK DIED</ENAMEX> at 3 p.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EDT</ENAMEX>, Oct. 8, 1974, and was promptly resurrected under new owners to shore up confidence in other banks during a recession.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Burns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> chairman, said the government's ``luck'' in keeping the bank open -- despite being the then-biggest U.S. bank failure -- prevented ``shock waves around the country and around the world.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> officials who had been probing the bank for months arranged a merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European-American Bank & Trust</ENAMEX>, owned by six foreign banks, to avert the closedown. And federal insurance protected the bank's 631,163 depositors.
The crisis had peaked on May 10, 1974, when the bank disclosed ``severe'' foreign-exchange losses due to ``unauthorized'' trading. Massive withdrawals followed and there was a brief rescue attempt, with political undertones, including $1.77 billion in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> loans.
Within six years many figures were convicted for their illegal abuse of Franklin funds. In June 1980, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michele Sindona</ENAMEX> -- an Italian financier who in July 1972 had bought a 22% block of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin's</ENAMEX> stock from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loews Corp.</ENAMEX>, headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence A. Tisch</ENAMEX> -- was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and perjury. Included was the charge that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sindona</ENAMEX> siphoned $45 million of Franklin funds for his other ventures. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sindona</ENAMEX> in 1979 faked his ``kidnapping'' for 2 1/2 months to delay his trial.)
During 1976 to 1979, other former Franklin officials either pleaded guilty to or were found guilty of violations including phony transactions to hide the bank's losses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sindona</ENAMEX>, the onetime Vatican financial adviser with reported links to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mafia</ENAMEX>, died on March 22, 1986, at age 65, reportedly after drinking cyanide-laced coffee in an Italian prison. It happened four days after he was sentenced to life in prison for ordering a 1979 murder. Italian magistrates labeled his death a suicide.
