Officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> have intensified their efforts to regain authority over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s two most independent-minded and economically liberal provinces, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX>.
The officials are using two tactics. One is to offer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX>'s governor a job in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> that would represent a promotion but would at the same time remove him from a position in which he was ignoring central-planning directives.
The other is to step up a drive that is aimed ostensibly at fighting graft at the highest levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX> but that several sources say is actually geared to removing cadres who have opposed the central government's hard-line stance on political and economic policy.
Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> dismissed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang Xiang</ENAMEX>, the boldly reformist governor of the island province of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX>, supposedly for abusing his office for personal gain. But the 70-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX> was closely associated with ousted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao Ziyang</ENAMEX>, who named him governor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hainan</ENAMEX> last year. He had been a zealous advocate of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX>'s liberal economic reforms, often moving ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> in innovative development programs.
More than any other provinces, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX> have benefited from the decentralization policy carried out by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX>, who lost his job in June after refusing to use force against pro-democracy demonstrators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>. Several provinces have been allowed to retain a bigger share of profit tax instead of handing over most of their income to the central government.
Profit distribution between these provinces and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> has long been a source of conflict and is especially so now because the central government is strapped for cash.
These provinces also have been allowed to raise funds in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and elsewhere, with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> taking the most advantage of this. Instead of relying on allocations from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, the two provinces have generated their own funds to finance development and increasingly looked to capitalist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, as their beacon of development. Such stirrings of regionalism trouble <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s hard-liners, who have consolidated power after the democracy movement was suppressed in June. They are moving to bring these provinces back into the socialist orbit.
``The signs are there that the tension between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> is escalating,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> businessman with access to senior officials in the province. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> leaders apparently want to remove cadres they don't like and replace them with their cronies in order to whip the province into line.''
The action in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> also is viewed by analysts as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> hard-liners' pre-emptive strike against a possible alliance between dissenting generals in the province, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s seven major military bases, and influential regional leaders. Dissenting voices in the south have grown since the June 4 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen</ENAMEX> massacre, but they are too weak for any open confrontation, and Chinese analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> is taking steps to quiet even those voices.
According to two sources familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong affairs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> leaders last month offered Ye <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xuanping</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX>'s governor, a more-senior post in the capital. Several jobs were offered, including a place in the cabinet, a post that would have brought with it responsibility for overseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macao</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s offer was aimed at removing the governor from his lock on power in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX>, the sources say. Son of the late Marshal Ye <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jianying</ENAMEX>, the man who paved the way for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX>'s re-emergence to power in 1977, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ye</ENAMEX> maintains close ties to the military. It is because of this that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> feels the need to tread softly in removing the governor from his power base.
``Keeping Ye in the south is like feeding a tiger at your doorstep,'' says one of the two sources.
Both sources say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ye</ENAMEX> is reluctant to accept the offer and is likely to use his influence to turn it down. If that happens, it isn't clear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> would force the governor to resign or offer him an even better job.
Under the autonomous four-year rule of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ye</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> has flourished by ignoring central-planning directives. More recently, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ye</ENAMEX> has told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> officials that he favors lifting martial law in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, arguing that it is bad for business in the south. Last month, he made an unsuccessful pitch to Premier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Peng</ENAMEX> to end martial law.
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> -- and in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX> -- the governor has shown tolerance and restraint toward dissidents. There were no sweeping arrests in the province of dissidents for organizing the mass pro-democracy demonstrations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. Apparently dissatisfied with the governor's liberal stand, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> sent a team of officials to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zhongshan University</ENAMEX> last month to investigate students and teachers.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> is stepping up what it describes as a nationwide drive to combat graft at the highest level of government. While <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> is keen to restore the government's credibility, which was badly eroded by the June massacre, several Chinese sources say the campaign is aimed primarily at removing cadres who have flouted the central government's directives. And nowhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> have provincial officials operated with more autonomy than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang Xiang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX>'s governor, provides a striking example. Chinese sources said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> was especially angered by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX>'s open support for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX>'s liberal stance toward the student pro-democracy movement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xu Shijie</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX> party secretary, disclosed the decision by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Council</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s cabinet, to oust Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX> at a meeting of the provincial People's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on Wednesday, according to the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China News Agency</ENAMEX>.
In an apparent attempt to dampen speculation about the motive for the firing, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX> party secretary Xu <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shijie</ENAMEX> took pains to explain that the dismissal involved Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX>'s ``personal'' problems and wasn't related to the ouster of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Council</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX> had allowed his wife and children to rake in huge profits from their businesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX> also abused his power by obtaining a permit for his son to stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX> had experimented with aggressive economic reforms on the tropical island province, including leasing a large tract of land for development to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumagai Gumi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">) Ltd.</ENAMEX>, which is 35%-owned by the big Japanese construction company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumagai Gumi Co.</ENAMEX> The project, which has faced stiff opposition from party conservatives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, who deem it a form of colonial subservience, has been delayed.
Central government investigators have centered their probe on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX>'s ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao Erjun</ENAMEX>, the second of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> chief's four sons. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX> operated a real estate company that had allegedly speculated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hainan</ENAMEX> property, another Chinese source says. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liang</ENAMEX> is suspected of approving the speculation.
A second probe instigated by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> involves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yu Fei</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX>'s six vice governors. He is being scrutinized for his alleged tilt toward ``bourgeois liberalism,'' or corrupt Western influences, which hardliners blame for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s political turmoil. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yu</ENAMEX>, who has a reputation among foreign businessmen of being a born deal maker, is renowned for pushing ahead with bold reform measures even when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> hasn't declared its position.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yu</ENAMEX> also is being investigated for allegedly accepting bribes and for his links to his chief economic aide, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xu Yunian</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX>'s top foreign-trade official, was sacked earlier this month for squandering public funds on luxuries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo</ENAMEX> cars and mobile telephones.
Chinese analysts don't expect the anticorruption purge to be sweeping, but those few people from whom <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> is gunning are prominent figures. ``It's not accidental that those being purged fall in the same category; that is they have owed their ascent to either Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX> or his liberal economic reform policies,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> businessman.
