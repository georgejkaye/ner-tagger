Designers Debate
Merits of Mergers
ARE ACQUISITIONS of design firms for better or for worse?
This week's sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landor Associates</ENAMEX>, a top corporate-identity firm, to ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX> for about $40 million rekindles the debate over whether mergers and acquisitions are hurting the cause of good design. Three other design companies have recently been acquired.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Beck</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitch Richardson-Smith</ENAMEX>, says mergers ``will be excellent for design'' because they are forcing designers to get more involved in the planning and marketing of products, not just the creative execution. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch & Co.</ENAMEX> paid $18 million to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richardson-Smith</ENAMEX>, which like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landor</ENAMEX> works on logos, packaging and other designs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Love</ENAMEX>, a partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anspach</ENAMEX> Grossman <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal</ENAMEX>, acquired last year for $36 million by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX>, says the sale ``hasn't hurt our design capabilities'' and may have helped them.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rita-Sue Siegel</ENAMEX>, a design recruiter, warns that once acquired by publicly held companies, design companies feel pressure to ``trade in the designer who takes his time and comes up with something brilliant, for someone who can sell.''
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lawrence</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Design Foundation</ENAMEX>, an education and research group, says people in newly public design firms are talking about a newly felt ``pressure to grow.''
Turn Left at the Wolf,
Right at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Jay</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT A NEW</ENAMEX> 900-ACRE office, hotel and retail development outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, giant metal animals act as both art and landmarks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skidmore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owings & Merrill</ENAMEX> was hired to come up with signs and graphics for the Solana complex, a development by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maguire Thomas Partners</ENAMEX> and the real estate arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX>. Because the complex was striving to be architecturally innovative, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skidmore Owings</ENAMEX> felt creative pressure.
Heading the team, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debra Nichols</ENAMEX> designed three 10-foot-high animals -- a horse, a steer and a wolf -- to mark major intersections. Three five-foot-wide birds -- a roadrunner, an owl and a blue jay -- were made to indicate secondary intersections.
The animals, inspired by Huichol Indian art of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, are made of oxidized bronze and aluminum painted with bright colors such as hot pink, yellow and turquoise.
The animals are proving to be good guideposts. During a visit to the project, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nichols</ENAMEX> heard someone who works there tell a truck driver to ``turn left at the steer.'' The driver nodded in recognition.
The entire Solana sign system, including inside and outside directions and identifiers, received one of three top awards in this year's competition by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society of Environmental Graphic Designers</ENAMEX>.
New Wave of Watches
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tells Tide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIME</ENAMEX> HAS COME for tide watches.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Saunders</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Califon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, engineer and shallow-water sailor, was bothered that his tide charts were ``never there when I needed them.'' So he designed a computerized, digital wristwatch that tells how high the tide is now and how high it's going to be at any date and time during the coming year.
``Tidewatch'' comes with three years of tide setting data for over 240 locations on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> coasts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> While not as accurate as a tide chart, the watch is handier to use on deck.
A more expensive ``Tidal Chronometer'' was designed by attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Krieger</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, who had trouble getting his boat under low bridges. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissmade</ENAMEX> quartz watch tells the tide, phase of the moon, time and date. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krieger</ENAMEX> plans to introduce a solid gold model, ``an image product,'' next year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hattori Seiko Co.</ENAMEX> sells two versions of an electronic tidal wristwatch, one for eastern and one for western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. An alarm goes off when the tide is supposed to be best for catching fish. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seiko apparently</ENAMEX> has no plans to adapt its ``Fishing Master'' to the U.S.
Odds and Ends
CHEWING YOUR pencil gets more satisfying. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> designers Constantin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boym</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurene Leon</ENAMEX> make edible pencils out of graphite, biscotti and ``a clay-like organic substance'' and win first prize in a writing instrument contest.... <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hot</ENAMEX> water circulates through the back of a fog-free shaving mirror for the shower. By raising the glass to air temperature, the mirror, invented by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Christianson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, eliminates condensation.
