Buell Industries Inc. said it has agreed to sell the assets of its small screw and nut product lines here to Illinois Tool Works Inc., Chicago. Terms weren't provided.
For the nine months ending July 31, the product lines represented about $15 million of Buell's $66 million in sales, but ``could not be operated profitably in the face of increased operating costs, declining sales, the prospect of major pollution-control expenditures and little expectation of price relief in a very competitive market,'' Buell said in a news release.
As a result of the sale, about 175 of Buell's 600 Waterbury, Conn., employees will lose their jobs. Buell, which also makes larger diameter fasteners and metal stampings, employs about 150 elsewhere.
Illinois Tool makes specialty tools.
