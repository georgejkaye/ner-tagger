The dollar weakened in indecisive trading as foreign-exchange dealers awaited fresh economic news that they hope will jolt the U.S. unit out of its narrow ranges.
The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late August, prompting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Canada</ENAMEX> to sell the Canadian currency on the market.
Traders say that after a week of nervously tracking every development on Wall Street, the foreign-exchange market has settled back to catch its breath ahead of new U.S. economic data. They noted, however, that a 26-point drop in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in the day.
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks, down from 1.8578 marks late Friday, and at 141.90 yen, down from 142.43 yen late Friday. Sterling was quoted at $1.6030, up from $1.5885 late Friday.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Tuesday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at 141.80 yen, down from Monday's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of 142.40 yen.
The market's attention is especially focused on a preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product, due out Thursday, which could show the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively brisk pace.
The consensus view on real GNP, the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation, calls for a 2.3% gain on an annual basis, slowing somewhat from the second quarter's 2.5%, but still fairly strong.
Few market participants expect the U.S. unit to rally sharply on the news, if it turns out as expected. Many contend that the report may overstate the economy's health and predict the third-quarter figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time to come.
``Everyone is waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Simon</ENAMEX>, an assistant treasurer with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank Julius Baer & Co.</ENAMEX> ``Yet even a relatively strong number -- 2.8% to 2.9% -- won't alter the market's view that the economy is softening.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Pedroli</ENAMEX>, managing director of foreign exchange at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, adds, ``The market sees this as the last piece of good news.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedroli</ENAMEX> notes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> deflator, a measure of inflation, is expected to slow, which would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> more room to ease key U.S. rates.
Analysts predict a 3.5% rise in the deflator, after climbing 4.6% in the second quarter.
They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade gap in August was reported earlier this month, hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy was losing its momentum. A 190-point plunge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock shares compounded the view, they say.
``Everyone is extremely convinced the economy is slowing,'' says one senior <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> dealer. ``If we're not headed for a recession, we're certainly headed for a major slowdown.''
While the market expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders, scheduled for release today, participants note that the figures will probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment.
U.S. durable goods orders are expected to show a decline of 1.2% in September, according to economists. The anticipated drop follows a 3.9% rise in August.
Traders, however, are quick to point out that while there is little enthusiasm for buying dollars, the U.S. unit has found a ``natural bottom'' at about 1.85 marks and 140 yen.
Its resilience around these levels is pegged to persistent investor demand for the greenback, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, gold for current delivery settled at $367 an ounce, down 30 cents. Estimated volume was a very light one million ounces.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Tuesday, gold was quoted at $366.79 an ounce.
