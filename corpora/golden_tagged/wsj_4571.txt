<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifeguards</ENAMEX> cavort in swimsuits, sharp-jawed young men run around with guns, shapely models-on-the-way-up shimmy through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. They're the warp and woof of network television, the images that have danced through living rooms for years. They win ratings, and more importantly, they help sell products to advertisers' favorite consumers.
This new TV season is no different. Except on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>. There you'll find a 42-year-old career Marine major; a congressman; a zookeeper; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Chamberlain</ENAMEX> playing a doctor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. They join such CBS stalwarts as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela Lansbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Newhart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Wyman</ENAMEX>.
In a striking denial of conventional programming wisdom, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX>'s TV network has elected to virtually ignore the teen and young adult market in prime time and deliberately gear its shows to a bedrock audience of older viewers. Now program executives have new marching orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producers: If the show sounds like ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> Vice,'' we're not interested.
``They're telling every producer to add 15 years to their characters,'' says a rival network executive.
In the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> tried hard to attract viewers aged 18-34. But the network just couldn't get it right. Even when it was No. 1 in overall ``household'' ratings earlier this decade, it was known as the ``gray'' network. The morbid joke was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> was losing 5% of its audience a year -- to death.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> came to its new strategy this past spring when it picked the fall schedule premiering now. Though executives had ordered shows involving youth icons <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Murphy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Ackroyd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon Zappa</ENAMEX>, none were picked up as regular series for September.
Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> scheduled shows like ``Major Dad,'' ``Island Son'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peaceable Kingdom</ENAMEX>,'' while renewing marginal shows like ``Paradise,'' ``Tour of Duty,'' and the aging ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>,'' ``Knots Landing'' and ``Falcon Crest.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> research guru <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Poltrack</ENAMEX> has been preaching the virtues of older viewers for years, arguing that their discretionary income is high and will rise even more as the baby boom generation ages. ``Thirty-five plus is where the action is,'' he keeps saying.
For years, that seemed like an afterthought, the lame refuge of desperate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> ad sales people. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Entertainment</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brandon Tartikoff</ENAMEX> nicknamed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poltrack CBS</ENAMEX>'s ``vice president of excuses.'' But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poltrack</ENAMEX> kept proselytizing, and his ideas have finally found favor.
Some advertisers are still baffled by the strategy. ``I'm not knocking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sisk</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX>, ``but the main arena for network television is still 18 to 34.''
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producers aren't very happy with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> approach, either. They won't talk on the record -- they still have to sell shows to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> -- but their argument runs like this: Shows that cater to older audiences tend to be more traditional, more formulaic. They elevate the familiar and the comfortable.
These producers say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> is the No. 3 network, and it should follow the prescription used successfully by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> in the early 1980s and by ABC more recently, when each network rose from the ashes. With more open slots on their schedules, the networks became more experimental and gave slow-building shows a chance. That's what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> did with ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Street Blues</ENAMEX>'' and ``Cheers'' and what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> did with ``Moonlighting'' and ``thirtysomething.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nowadays</ENAMEX>, No. 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> uses older-skewing shows like ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matlock</ENAMEX>'' only for counterprogramming purposes. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tartikoff</ENAMEX> has compared the shows' demographics to a ``cancer'' or ``virus'' -- better to quarantine them on particular nights so they don't bleed all over the schedule.
But taking risks in this era of dwindling network share takes more guts than ever. ``When failure was a 20 share, it was OK to experiment,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Harris</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imagine Entertainment</ENAMEX>. ``Now, failure's an 8. The definition of the bottom has changed. It's a disaster as opposed to a problem.'' He says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> renewed the low-rated but older-skewing ``Tour of Duty'' and ``Paradise'' because they had a ``floor'' audience of loyalists.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poltrack</ENAMEX> concurs: ``When people ask me if we'll beat ABC this season, I say that the race for No. 2 will be determined not by the shows at the top of the ratings but the ones at the bottom.''
As young viewers increasingly sample <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MTV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nickelodeon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fox</ENAMEX> network, the competition for youth is even fiercer. Last year's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> attempts were particularly catastrophic: ``TV 101'' (high school), ``Dirty Dancing'' (from the movie) and last summer's ``Live-In'' (about an Australian au pair) all bombed.
Part of the problem is promotion. How can you plug a program geared to young people during ``60 Minutes'' or ``Murder, She Wrote''? Last year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> was forced to buy ads for its young-skewing target audience on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MTV</ENAMEX> because there were so few places on its own schedule to advertise; this season only one show, ``The Famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>,'' requires MTV. And on that show, about a young man just out of the army who winds up working at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> talent agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s suggestion to producers was to add a grandmother.
``Major Dad'' is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s flagship show this season. It scored higher than any other among test audiences, and the network chose it to lead off its key Monday night comedy lineup. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Mcraney</ENAMEX> plays a ramrod-straight Marine major who marries his opposite, a liberal reporter. He moves in with her houseful of kids and conflicts ensue. Normally, executives would pray that one of the kids would ``break out'' and win a young following -- like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J. Fox</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk Cameron</ENAMEX>.
But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal</ENAMEX> Television first brought the show to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcraney</ENAMEX> played a widower with children. The network suggested the producers add the wife and not let the kids take over. ``The adults,'' executive producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Pomerantz</ENAMEX> says firmly, ``are the focus.'' The network has coaxed another new comedy, ``The People Next Door,'' in the same direction.
These moves dovetail neatly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s theories on other fronts: It has more prime time news than competitors, it bid more to air baseball games and the Olympics, it has been aggressively buying theatrical motion pictures and it has begun a major cross-promotion with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> executives also say that because many older viewers live alone, programming to an older audience will improve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s overall ``household'' ratings. Advertisers may buy demographics, not households, they say, but there is still an important psychological advantage to finishing first or second in the household ratings race.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> has its supporters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy Frank</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi</ENAMEX> ad agency, says network television itself is increasingly the province of older viewers. ``For years, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Poltrack</ENAMEX> was a lone voice in the wilderness, and a lot of it came across as self-serving. But I'll tell you, the man was right.''
Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Mcqueen</ENAMEX>, the senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foote</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cone & Belding</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCB</ENAMEX>\: ``When you're No. 3, you have to have a strategy that differentiates you from the other guys.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> doesn't want to differentiate itself too much, though, lest it feed the idea that it is abandoning the mission of being a traditional broad-appeal network like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> and ``narrow-casting'' to its mature niche. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Entertainment</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Lemasters</ENAMEX> says that episodes of several shows that appeal to young people have been ordered as midseason replacements. ``We're dedicated to having a full-spectrum demographic,'' he insists.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcqueen</ENAMEX> counsels consistency. He cautions that troubled networks have a tendency to panic, to pull the plug on new shows too quickly, to shift gears without warning.
``They have a new strategy,'' he says of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>. ``Now I hope they'll stick to it.
