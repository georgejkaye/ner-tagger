<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks closed mixed in thin dealings, hardly changed from the previous day.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> shares finished higher on the strength of bargain-hunting and renewed takeover-related trading.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market rose in the morning, helped by arbitrage buying and gains made through small-lot buying of retail and shipping issues. But uncertainty regarding the direction of currencies and domestic interest rates discouraged further buying interest, traders said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index of 225 selected issues was down 0.49 point to 34470.58. The index fell 1.47 points Tuesday.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Thursday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index spurted 219.71 points to 34690.29.
Wednesday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 600 million shares, down from 658 million Tuesday. Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declining issues, 476 to 472, while 169 remained unchanged.
An official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Securities</ENAMEX> said institutional investors took a wait-and-see attitude regarding currencies ahead of the meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations scheduled for Saturday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wako Securities</ENAMEX> official also noted that as the market continues to lack focus, institutional investors are unlikely to participate in active trading even after their midyear book closings -- most of which fall this week.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Stock Price Index (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Topix</ENAMEX>) of all issues listed in the First Section, which lost 3.16 points Tuesday, was down 3.49 points, or 0.13%, at 2615.58.
The Second Section index, which gained 2.90 points Tuesday, was up 14.80 points, or 0.43%, to close at 3426.89.
Volume in the second section was estimated at 23 million shares, up slightly from 22 million Tuesday.
Wednesday's losers included constructions and housings. Some were firmer in the morning but were pressured down by profit-taking toward the end of the day. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taisei</ENAMEX> was down 40 yen (27 cents) to 1,560 yen ($10.69). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohbayashi</ENAMEX> lost 30 to 1,710.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housings</ENAMEX> were sluggish after Tuesday's gains, although they were among the issues most recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities</ENAMEX>, the largest among the Big Four brokerage houses, at an official October-March strategy meeting Tuesday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sekisui House</ENAMEX> lost 40 to 2,480 and Misawa Homes fell 30 to 2,900.
Traders said housings were sluggish because investors bought these issues earlier this week on speculation they would be included in the most recommended lists of the Big Four brokerage firms.
The remaining three big brokerages will also hold their meetings later this week to set up strategies for the latter half of the year beginning next month.
Among losing issues were electric utilities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Electric Power</ENAMEX> slid 10 to 5,730, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansai Electric Power</ENAMEX> lost 40 to 4,420 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chubu Electric Power</ENAMEX> was down 40 to 4,150.
Steels including the ``big five'' such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Steel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe Steel</ENAMEX> as well as smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Steel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nisshin Steel</ENAMEX> declined amid growing expectations of higher interest rates, traders said.
Retails attracted buying because of strong earnings prospects based on growing domestic consumption and on speculation about restructuring in the sector, traders said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isetan</ENAMEX> surged 400 to 4,610. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seiyu</ENAMEX> advanced 90 to 2,650 and Seven-Eleven added 530 to 8,530.
Local banks also attracted interest because of speculation about mergers and acquisitions. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yamaguchi Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Joyo Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Keiyo Bank</ENAMEX> were among gainers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shippings</ENAMEX> rose following a Japanese paper's report Wednesday that sales have been recovering rapidly this year from a protracted slump.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Yusen</ENAMEX> gained 20 to 1,060. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui O.S.K. Lines</ENAMEX> was up 12 to 915. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kawasaki Kisen</ENAMEX> added 34 to 935.
Other notable gainers included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX>, which gained 150 to 4,500 amid expectation for large gratis issues, as well as its strong earnings outlook because of its laser disk business, traders said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London</ENAMEX> shares closed higher but overall the session was marked by modest volume and the continued absence of active institutional interest.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 100-share index closed at 2369.8, up 8.3. The index, however, closed substantially off its intraday high of 2379.8, hit in the early bargain-buying rush. Its session low was its opening level of
The narrower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 30-share index closed up 6.3 at 1954.6. Volume improved slightly, to 513.1 million shares from Tuesday's light 393.5 million.
Dealers said news of a possible hostile bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> by U.S. auto maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX> gave the market a much-needed shot in the arm even though the auto maker's interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> concern wasn't viewed as a major surprise.
They said that speculation over prospects for other friendly or hostile bids for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> helped to rekindle general takeover speculation on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> market. Some buy programs early in the session also help support the market, dealers added. They attributed the buying to Tuesday's moderate declines and the bargain opportunities presented.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> closed at 510 pence ($8.01) a share, up 43 (68 cents). Fifteen million shares were traded, with 11 million of the total turnover in the auto maker before midday.
Also among the big gainers of the session was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMC Group</ENAMEX>, a concrete producer, which gained 22 to 735, ahead of interim earnings Thursday.
Its share price has been steadily rising this week in anticipation of good results and in sympathy with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>'s  largest builder, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarmac</ENAMEX>, dealers said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarmac</ENAMEX>, which Tuesday reported buoyant trading results, closed at 298, up 9.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX>, which sold its chemicals unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> for # 568 million ($893 million) surged 12 to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaxo</ENAMEX>, hit by profit-taking and earnings downgrades a day earlier, continued under some pressure, falling 7 to # 15.18. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dealers</ENAMEX> said the market shrugged off early gains in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glaxo</ENAMEX> and took profit again. Volume in its shares was a moderate 2.2 million.
