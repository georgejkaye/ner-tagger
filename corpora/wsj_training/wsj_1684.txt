Ever since the hotly contested <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s Cup race last year, the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it. Now that a key member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> Yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> team is splitting off to form his own team, even more competition lies ahead.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Isler</ENAMEX>, the winning navigator in the past two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s Cup challenges, has split from the team led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Conner</ENAMEX>, skipper of the victorious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stars & Stripes</ENAMEX>, to form his own team for the next contest in 1992. And, in addition to a crack team of sailors, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isler</ENAMEX> has lined up some real brass to help him finance the syndicate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isler Sailing International</ENAMEX>'s advisory board includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> chairman and a former Cup victor; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter G. Diamandis</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamandis Communications</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph B. Vittoria</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis Inc.</ENAMEX> His steering committee includes other notable businessmen, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> investor and old salt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy E. Disney</ENAMEX>.
``We have the structure, people and plan,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isler</ENAMEX> said in a statement. Now, the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $3 million alone, and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $25 million for a Cup challenge.
The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> Yacht <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> challengers' 90-foot monohull. In September, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> appellate court overturned a state judge's ruling that awarded the Cup to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> team.
Pending an appeal by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> team, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Fay</ENAMEX>, the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled to be held in mid-1992 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>. But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX>'s team has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title.
``If you don't know what the rules of the game are, it's hard to start your fund-raising or design,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dana Smith</ENAMEX>, an official with Team <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Conner</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner</ENAMEX> team won't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said, and the syndicate's budget could easily reach $30 million.
But spokesmen for both Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isler</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isler</ENAMEX>'s desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now, rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cup Organizing Committee</ENAMEX> insist that the added competition for the defender's spot will only improve the race.
