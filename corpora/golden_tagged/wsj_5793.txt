<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to sell the credit-card operation of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus Consumer Bank</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York Co.</ENAMEX> subsidiary for $168 million.
The move comes seven months after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> put the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Orange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, branch of the bank on the block because of asset-growth limits on so-called non-bank banks, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus Consumer.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> said then that the move was designed to take the bank out of demand deposits -- the so-called retail side -- and to let it concentrate on credit cards, mortgages and certificates of deposits.
The price breaks out to $120 million plus $8 million of payments annually for six years in return for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> won't compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> in the credit-card business. The sale of the credit accounts, which the companies expect to close around the end of November, is subject to regulatory clearance and approval by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfus</ENAMEX>'s board.
``It became clear that the direction of the credit-card business is that a large number of cards are needed to keep costs low,'' a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> said. Issuers must do a large volume to gain economies of scale, he said, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> faced the decision either to acquire other credit-card businesses or to sell its own.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Keefe</ENAMEX>, analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>, called the deal ``a little bit of a surprise... but I'm sure they've done this with the long term in mind.'' The analyst, who calls himself an ``incorrigible bull'' on Dreyfus and has a buy recommendation out on its stock, notes that selling the credit accounts will fatten <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfus</ENAMEX>'s about $600 million cash hoard. The company has declined to say what it plans to do with those funds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyfus</ENAMEX>'s  portfolio the fourth-largest Mastercard Gold portfolio in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, encompassing more than 320,000 accounts with $790 million in credit outstanding. The credit-card business accounted for the lion's share -- $20.7 million -- of the bank's $22.9 million of 1988 revenue. Earnings for the credit-card operation were unavailable, but it is known to be highly profitable.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX>), the buyer, has more than two million cards issued, accounting for some $2.8 billion of credit outstanding at June 30. ``We plan to continue to expand this business, both through internal growth and by solicitation and acquisition of credit-card portfolios,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> said.
Under an existing agreement, the receivables from the Mastercard accounts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus Consumer Bank</ENAMEX> are reflected in the financial statements of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX>), and the two companies share the revenue.
In 1982, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln State Bank</ENAMEX> for $2.8 million and then sold the bank's commercial-loan portfolio. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> renamed it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus Consumer Bank</ENAMEX> and, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keefe</ENAMEX>, realized a strong return on the investment. Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> agreed to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Orange</ENAMEX> branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus Consumer</ENAMEX> to a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broad National Bancorp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX> That sale is awaiting regulatory approval.
Under federal law, banks can take consumer deposits and make commercial loans. The so-called non-bank banks make consumer loans but not commercial loans; this allows commercial concerns like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX>, which primarily manages mutual funds, to own them.
