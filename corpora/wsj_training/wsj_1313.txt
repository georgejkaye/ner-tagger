The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mouth</ENAMEX> is back.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton Downey Jr.</ENAMEX>, who self-destructed as a talk-show host and frequently verbally abused his guests, has been signed to co-host a half-hour nightly program on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer News</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Channel</ENAMEX>, the cable channel partly owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>
The premiere of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Showdown</ENAMEX>,'' with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard G. Carter</ENAMEX>, a columnist with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Daily News</ENAMEX>, is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CNBC</ENAMEX> is available to 13 million cable households.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downey</ENAMEX> said he is not going to change his style, which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive. ``But I'm going to proceed in a more logical way. I'm not going to do anything that is not acceptable in anyone's home. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to get angry.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Eskridge</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CNBC</ENAMEX>, said that although there will be a studio audience, viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mort Mort Mort</ENAMEX> '' But just how does Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downey</ENAMEX>'s unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNBC</ENAMEX>'s business programming?
``Ninety percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mort</ENAMEX>'s old show fits into our style,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eskridge</ENAMEX>. ``That is consumer issues.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Downey</ENAMEX>'s previous show, a one-hour shout fest, syndciated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> and produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum Media Inc.</ENAMEX>, was canceled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> after advertisers and stations abandoned it.
