A federal grand jury here indicted a man accused of selling crack cocaine to an undercover federal agent in a ploy set up to provide a prop for President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s televised speech on drugs.
Drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> agents had lured the defendant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Jackson</ENAMEX>, to a park near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to provide a prop for the president's contention that drugs can be bought anywhere. The incident embarrassed the administration because drug dealing doesn't usually take place in the park.
On Monday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, who was charged with selling crack on other occasions, had disappeared. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> attributed the disappearance to a report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> incident in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>. But Monday night, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> tracked down and arrested the defendant, according to a spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney here.
