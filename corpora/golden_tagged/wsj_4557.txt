<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Lu</ENAMEX>, an exiled veteran of the democracy demonstrations crushed in June by the Chinese communists in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>, examines his ballot, then writes in his choices for the leaders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation</ENAMEX> for a Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FDC</ENAMEX>). Behind him sits a delegate from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. Nearby are other Chinese from places as far-flung as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>. From behind long tables stacked with notebooks they watch as the votes are tallied on an easel at the front of the room.
Thus is the leadership being installed, here in a blue-carpeted hall far from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> -- for a new organization that intends over the coming years to finally liberate the Chinese mainland. Only a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s leading democrats have been able to escape from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> itself to cast their votes. They are among 167 Chinese delegates who have come from more than a dozen countries to found the new federation. This group aims to carry the torch for, among millions of others, the millions of Chinese who demonstrated and the thousands who died this past spring in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen</ENAMEX> uprising for democracy.
The calm scene, which took place Sunday in this <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> suburb, was a world away from the ragged tent encampment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>, where the 23-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> and his fellow demonstrators made their stand against the Chinese army. Then, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s citizens were dying in the surrounding streets, trying to protect the leaders of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s democratic movement from the approaching soldiers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> meeting featured French biscuits and a helpful hotel staff. The determination was the same, however, as that which caught the sympathy of the Free World when TV cameras focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s 1989 protests.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evry</ENAMEX> meeting generated intense debate about the best way to preserve the democratic aims of the movement. A draft charter drawn up by some older delegates was revised to provide a more balanced leadership. For several days after the conference ended Sunday, small groups were still thrashing out ways to resolve their differences. Their aims are of the democratic and capitalist variety that deserve support not only from the French, but also from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. State Department</ENAMEX> -- which in its eagerness to stay cozy with the Chinese regime has at best played pickup to the French in aiding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s democratic movement.
The prime concern of the Bush administration so far seems to be the preservation of a ``stable'' situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDC</ENAMEX>'s new general secretary, exiled Chinese businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan Runnan</ENAMEX>, addressed this issue Sunday evening at a news conference held by the group's board of directors. ``We understand that a stable <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is in the interest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan</ENAMEX>. But he questioned whether it is possible now to have a stable <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. Both he and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDC</ENAMEX>'s new chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yan Jiaqi</ENAMEX>, pointed out that communist rule has produced a corrupt, inefficient and repressive regime -- facing yet another massive power struggle when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX> dies. Internal power grabs in the past have produced such horrors as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Leap</ENAMEX> Forward and the 1965-75 Cultural Revolution, in which millions died and hundreds of millions suffered. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is hopeless without democracy,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wan</ENAMEX>, adding, ``I believe that making a democratic and stable <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> will be in the interest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.''
The list of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDC</ENAMEX> delegates included a virtual who's who of the Chinese liberal thinkers who helped lead the protests in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> and were lucky enough to escape into exile: people such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yan</ENAMEX>, who in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> was the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> Academy of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Social Sciences</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> student leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wuer Kaixi</ENAMEX>, just elected vice chairman (his name sometimes appears as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Uerkesh Daolet</ENAMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nanjing</ENAMEX> student leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Lu</ENAMEX>, recently enrolled at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>; another social scientist, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chen Yizi</ENAMEX>; and film director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Su Xiao Kang</ENAMEX>. Since the June 3-4 attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>, many of their colleagues back home have been arrested or killed. It is a sign of the will driving this movement that less than four months after some of these delegates fled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, they already have regrouped in exile, set up a world-wide federation, and vowed in their manifesto ``to advance the cause of democracy'' at home.
It's hardly the first time that Chinese political outcasts have sought refuge and support in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s 85-year-old supreme leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> to meet fellow communists in the 1920s. Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>'s other notorious communists also studied or sought support in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> in their day, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>'s Ho Chi <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pol Pot</ENAMEX>. This time the emigre dissidents have got themselves on the right course. They have seen enough of the wreck the communists have made of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> during the past 40 years; at their meeting in Evry they did not even give lip service to building a ``better communist system'' -- as some cautious reformers tend to do when playing to the secret police and party toughs back in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDC</ENAMEX> manifesto signed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wuer Kaixi</ENAMEX> is fundamentally anti-communist. It recognizes the link between property and liberty. Among its statements: ``Taking away the property rights of the citizens in the name of the state is one of the important causes of economic stagnation and political dictatorship in all countries dominated by a communist party.'' The manifesto adds another crucial insight: ``Returning society's wealth to the people and developing private enterprise is the only road that will let <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> find a way out of its difficulties and achieve modernization.''
This, of course, is what many in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> had hoped Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> and some of his fellow cadres were aiming to achieve with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s economic liberalizations of the past 10 years. That ambition now seems to have survived only underground in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> or among Chinese abroad.
What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDC</ENAMEX> might do next is vague. The federation's goals for now are to publicize the arrests and general persecution continuing inside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, try to drum up world pressure for change by the Chinese regime, and try to ensure that news of this gets back to the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. The group says it plans to stick to peaceful methodsm -- but is still mulling over  just what these might be. A visitor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDC</ENAMEX> press office just set up at 10 Rue Faraday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> finds stacks of boxes yet to be unpacked in the four-room apartment, and two personal computers yet to be hooked up. The first priority has been to get the organization up and running; now comes the tough business of taking on -- somehow -- the Chinese government.
The manifesto of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federation</ENAMEX> for a Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> does acknowledge drawing inspiration from the Nationalist government on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDC</ENAMEX>,'' it says, ``is intimately concerned with the democratization process of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, and sees it as a profound influence for the cause of democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and the rebirth of the Chinese nation.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDC</ENAMEX> is also well aware that a failure to adhere to democratic principles cost the Nationalist regime the support it otherwise might have enjoyed -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and abroad -- in its own campaign to topple the communist dictatorship on the mainland.
