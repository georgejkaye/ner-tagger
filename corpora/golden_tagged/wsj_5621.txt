The news that troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> will get a cash infusion from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Development Inc.</ENAMEX> helped to spark a spirited rally in the junk bond market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York</ENAMEX> agreed to provide a $250 million loan, enough to tide over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> while it restructures, and enabling its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> department stores to meet payments to suppliers and creditors.
Although junk bond prices were higher across the board, the so-called ``high quality'' junk bonds picked up the biggest gains, with some rising as many as three points, or about $30 for each $1,000 face amount. While those are impressive gains, they represent only a portion of the market's loses from last week when junk issues fell about five points.
The high-yield bond market was thrown into turmoil last week when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> disclosed it was running short of cash. But, ``at least for now, the downward pressure on prices appears to have subsided,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank V. Colombo</ENAMEX>, director of high-yield research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillon Read & Co.</ENAMEX> The biggest gainers, he said, were companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Holdings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum Chemicals</ENAMEX>, which are considered among the financially stronger junk bond issuers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> announcement triggered price gains in the bonds of other retailers as well, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.H. Macy & Co.</ENAMEX>, whose 14 1/2% subordinated debentures due 2001 traded late at 101, up about two points.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Holdings</ENAMEX>' 14.7% convertible pay-in-kind securities maturing in 2009 jumped 3 1/2 to close at 99 while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroger</ENAMEX>'s 12 7/8% senior subordinated debentures due 1999 rose one point to 104.
The bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> unit, among the worse hit in last week's sell off , recouped some loses but remain at extremely low levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX>'s 16% senior subordinated debentures due 2000 were bid at 61 yesterday after being quoted in the mid-50s late last week.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> news certainly helped, but we reached a point where many bargain hunters believed prices had hit the bottom,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Avelar</ENAMEX>, portfolio manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber High Yield Bond Fund</ENAMEX>. He said: ``The sellers have been forced out already,'' including some large junk bond mutual funds that sold portions of their holdings last week to raise cash to meet redemption needs.
As the junk bond market gained momentum, some potential buyers complained of a growing scarcity of supply. Said one money manager: ``The illiquidity on the upside is as bad as the illiquidity on the down side.''
It was a busy day for bonds in other markets as well. In the municipal market, more than $1 billion of new tax-exempt notes and bonds were issued yesterday. Treasury prices, after rising in early trading, ended narrowly mixed. Mortgage-backed securities gained 1/32 to 2/32.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>'s $1.5 billion debut in the federal agency debt market ``was several times oversubscribed, easily,'' according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> Treasurer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Roth</ENAMEX>.
The 10-year global bonds, a new type of security that will be denominated in dollars and traded globally on a 24-hour basis, were priced at 8 3/8% at 99.55 to yield 8.44%. The yield was about.375 percentage point above the outstanding 10-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> note, tighter than some traders had expected. When secondary trading began, the notes traded at a premium, another sign of strong demand.
The offering was made simultaneously in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> through an international syndicate led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Ltd.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency Securities</ENAMEX>
Treasurys ended narrowly mixed after retracing earlier gains.
Bond prices moved higher yesterday morning after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Labor</ENAMEX> reported better-than-expected inflation statistics and lower-than-expected housing starts data.
``The news was bullish for the market,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Capra</ENAMEX>, a vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds fell later in the day as dealers began selling Treasury securities in an effort to hedge against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>'s $1.5 billion 10-year notes offering.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 100 9/32 to yield 8.09% compared with 100 10/32 to yield 8.085% Monday. The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 99 10/32 to yield 8.08% compared with 99 09/32 to yield 8.086% Monday.
Short-term interest rates rose slightly. The discount rate on three-month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills was quoted at 7.73% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.97% while the rate on six-month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills was 7.68% for a yield of 8.08%.
Elsewhere, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financing Corp.</ENAMEX> said it accepted a bid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> to purchase $665 million of 8.60% 30-year bonds at a weighted price of 99.698 and a weighted yield of 8.628%.
Looking ahead, analysts said they don't expect any surprises in today's release of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>'s latest edition of the so-called ``Tan Book.''
The Tan Book is an official summary of the economic reports by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s 12 district banks that is prepared before a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Open Market Committee</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s policy-making arm will next convene on Oct. 3.
Mortgage-Backed Securities
Mortgage securities ended another quiet session with gains of 1/32 to 2/32.
Trading was light in both the passthrough sector and the derivative securities market, which had been active during the past week because of heavy issuance of real estate mortgage investment conduits.
Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> 9% securities for October delivery ended at 97 25/32, up 2/32; 9 1/2% securities at 99 27/32, up 2/32; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Mortage Corp.</ENAMEX> 9% securities at 96 29/32, up 1/32.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> 9s were yielding 9.44% as the spread above the 10-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> note held at 1.37 percentage points. The 10-year note was up about 3/32 at 99 15/32.
Municipals
Swamped by the pricing of more than $1 billion in new long-term issues, municipal bonds posted session losses of as much as 7/8 point and were markedly underperforming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Treasurys.
Symptomatic of the underperformance, December municipal futures slipped 15/32 to 92 3/32, while December T-bond futures lost only 2/32 to end the afternoon session at 97 8/32.
A two-part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dormitory Authority</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">State of New York</ENAMEX> borrowing, totaling more than $874 million, dominated the long-term arena yesterday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX> was the lead underwriter.
The offering includes about $692.1 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University Educational Facilities</ENAMEX> revenue bonds priced to yield from 6.3% in 1991 to 7.52% in 2015. There were also $182.2 million of special obligation bonds due 1989, priced to yield from 5.9% in 1990 to 7% in 2003-2007.
In the secondary market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Jersey Turnpike Authority</ENAMEX> 7.2% issue of 2018 was locked at 97 1/8, down 3/8 on the bid side and yielding about 7.44%. Late Monday, the bonds were quoted at 97 1/2 to 97 3/4, where they yielded about 7.39%.
Foreign Bonds
Helped by profit-taking on short positions, the Japanese government bond market ended firmer Tuesday.
Some Japanese institutional investors closed their short positions in the futures market to take profits after recent declines, according to traders. In a short sale, dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by buying the securities back a lower price to replace what was borrowed.
As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.75, up 0.43. The yield fell to 5.31%.
However, this rebound is just a temporary recovery, said one dealer, echoing bearish sentiment expressed by other participants recently. Either the yen will weaken further, as many analysts believe, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> will boost interest rates to defend the yen as well as quell domestic inflationary pressures. In either case, the yen bond market will weaken, the dealer said.
Elsewhere:
-- In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, prices of British government bonds ended slightly lower. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 6/32 to 113 17/32 to yield 9.88% while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s 11 3/4% notes due 1991 were unchanged at 99 10/32 to yield 12.26%.
-- West German government bonds ended as much as 0.30 point higher. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX>'s 6 3/4% bond due June 1999 ended 0.15 point higher at 98.90 to yield 6.90% while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 are up the same amount at 98.775 and yield 7.05%.
Corporate Issues
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX>-grade corporate bonds ended unchanged in quiet trading. There were no new issues.
