<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usacafes Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> said it completed the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonanza</ENAMEX> restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metromedia Co.</ENAMEX> for $71 million in cash.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usacafes</ENAMEX>, which is nearly half-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wyly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonanza</ENAMEX> franchise system, which generates about $600 million in sales annually, represented substantially all of the partnership's assets.
The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> court, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usacafes</ENAMEX> said. The company said it believes the suit is without merit.
