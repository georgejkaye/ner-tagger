One of the more bizarre garden stories since Eden has been unfolding for four years now, in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of artist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX>. And if she and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battery Park City Authority</ENAMEX> have their way, her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden ``artwork'' in the downtown complex.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> scheme is called, will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. It could cost taxpayers $15 million to install and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BPC</ENAMEX> residents $1 million a year to maintain. Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX>, as now planned, will die from congestive garden design.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX>'s previous work, which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world, often took gardens as its nominal subject. Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPC Fine Arts Committee</ENAMEX> think she had a literal green thumb. (Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> would not discuss her garden for this article.)
Last year she boasted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HG magazine</ENAMEX>: ``I'd never looked at a garden in my life.'' And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> State public benefit corporation: ``The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden, which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Undeterred</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX> hired Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> and another confessed garden ignoramus, the architect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Cooper</ENAMEX>, who claimed he had never visited, much less built, a garden, and said of the project, ``I don't view this as a landscape. I view this as a building.'' The third principal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX> adventure did have garden experience. The firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Kelly/David Varnell Landscape Architects</ENAMEX> had created Central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Park</ENAMEX>'s Strawberry Fields and Shakespeare Garden. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX> called its team a ``stunning'' collaboration.
After four years, though, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX> design is 100% uncollaborated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX>. She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles -- and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall. But for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX>, the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them. In a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX>, kelly\ called this ``arbitrary and amateurish.'' The landscape architects were expelled from the garden in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
All the while, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had been busy at her assignment, serene in her sense of self-tilth. As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Graduate School</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Design</ENAMEX>: ``I have designed a garden, not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip.'' Moreover, she proclaimed that ``landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years'' in the design of open space. And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method: Commissioning a friend to spend ``five or six thousand dollars... on books that I ultimately cut up.'' After that, the layout had been easy. ``I've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail.'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client ``because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things.'' (This was never a problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX>, because the client had long since given in to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX>'s every whim.)
Last year the public was afforded a preview of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX>'s creation in a tablemodel version, at a BPC exhibition. The labels were breathy: ``Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design... a rose garden, herb garden, serpentine garden, flower fields, an apple orchard... organized in a patchwork of 50-by-50-foot squares to form `rooms'/POS... here and there are simple architectural forms, a whimsical jet of water, a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid, and chairs of every sort to drag around.... At the core of it all is a love for plants.''
Plant lovers who studied the maquette were alarmed. They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX>'s little rooms left little room for plants or people. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kelly</ENAMEX>\ had put <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX>' carrying capacity at four people per room, or about 100 humans overall. This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist's own digs: ``My loft was 50 by 100 feet, so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room.''
Inside the grid were 24 of these plant cells jammed full of clutter. One she made into a topiary rec room, replete with plants shaped into a Barcalounger, TV, piano and chairs. In another, she requisitioned topiary <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MX</ENAMEX> missile cones -- costing $10,000 each -- in heights up to 20 feet. Another she stuffed with eight ``rectilinear hedges'' for a topiary geometry lesson in the right-angling of plants. In the herbal lounge she specified a ``plaid knot garden'' decor. She ordered the foyer done in a different plaid planting, and made the landscape architects study a book on tartans.
In one garden roomette she implanted a 43-foot square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit, a ``zinc sink,'' a ``huge fishbowl with carp'' and a ``birdcage with cockatoos.'' Next door she put a smaller plaid-floored glass house, where, she suggested, a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of winter.
In another compartment called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linden Bosque</ENAMEX>, 62 linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindens</ENAMEX> need about 36 feet.)
One thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartlett</ENAMEX> plan was never in doubt: It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers, rosarians, orchardists and arborists. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> blithely suggested calling upon ``semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, she had insisted on paths so narrow (five to eight feet) and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment -- trucks or cherry pickers -- couldn't maneuver.
Then, to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had thrown up windowless walls (brick, lattice, hedge) eight to 10 feet tall, casting her interiors into day-long Stygian shade. It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX> without decking the walls in a Christmas-like array of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gro-Lites</ENAMEX>.
Finally, flouting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX>'s wishes to continue the popular two-mile riverside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Esplanade</ENAMEX>, prized for its expansive views of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Harbor, the Statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liberty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ellis Island</ENAMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> threw up yet another wall, this time concrete, this time 10 1/2 feet tall. She ran it the length of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX> riverfront, blotting out the city's great natural water features, the harbor and the river. (Within her garden, she has decreed a waterfall, a rill, ponds and other costly, trivial waterworks beside the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson.</ENAMEX>)
While the model was still on view, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manhattan Community Board</ENAMEX> 1 passed a resolution against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parks Council</ENAMEX> wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX> that this ``too `private'/''... exclusive,'' complex and expensive ``enclosed garden... belongs in almost any location but the waterfront.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynden B. Miller</ENAMEX>, the noted public garden designer who restored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Park</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conservatory Garden</ENAMEX>, recalls her reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX> model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">nd Street</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant Park</ENAMEX>: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant Park</ENAMEX>, as designed in 1933, failed as a public space, because it made people feel trapped. By removing the hedges and some walls, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant Park Restoration</ENAMEX> is opening it up. It seems to me the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX> plan has the potential of making <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX> a horticultural jail for people and plants.''
The three urban horticulture experts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell Cooperative Extension</ENAMEX> weighed in with a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX> that began: ``We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed.'' They then addressed the decidedly ``questionable safety of... a complex garden of endless hiding places. The 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small `rooms' insure... that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime.'' (At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had declared: ``There are going to be problems with safety... I'm not going to address questions of safety '')
Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Gardens</ENAMEX> design somehow continues on, seemingly impervious to reason, stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications. BPCA President and CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Emil</ENAMEX> hopes to negotiate a seawall that could ``be significantly more visually permeable.'' And by substituting yet another landscape architect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Quennell</ENAMEX>, he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the ``artistic vision'' of a ``truly great artist.'' After four years of no progress in this direction, it is doubtful any viable collaboration with Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> will suddenly now be possible. (Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quennell</ENAMEX> has said he plans to go with the grid, regardless.) There is still time, however, for Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Cuomo</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fabian Palomino</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPCA</ENAMEX> board, to prevent this topiary ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tilted Arc.</ENAMEX>''
These statesmen might take counsel from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Robinson</ENAMEX>, author of ``The English Flower Garden'' -- the gardener's bible since 1883 -- who seems to have had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Bartlett</ENAMEX> in mind when he wrote: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Unhappily</ENAMEX>, our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his `designs' to the garden.... It is this adapting of absurd `knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants.
