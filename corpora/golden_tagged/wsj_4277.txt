<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont Co.</ENAMEX>, seeking to speed to market some of its more promising drug candidates, entered a research and marketing pact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck & Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> will collaborate in developing a class of compounds for treating high blood pressure and heart disease, called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The two companies also will market the compounds together, if regulators grant marketing approval. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> gains marketing rights to two of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>'s established prescription drugs.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX>, the agreement represents an attempt to accelerate the payoff from its ambitious but expensive push into pharmaceuticals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rahway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, is the world's largest prescription drug company, with a veteran sales force and a strong record in taking drugs through clinical trials. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del.</ENAMEX>, is a major chemicals and energy company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph A. Mollica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX>'s vice president for pharmaceuticals, noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>'s involvement also ``represents a recognition of the strength of our research effort.'' Although several companies including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> have research interests in angiotensin II receptor antagonists, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> said it considers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> to be leading the pack.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> compound has just passed human safety trials and is in early efficacy trials. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX>, which hopes to get marketing clearance by the mid-1990s, estimates that the alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> could cut development time for the compounds by two years. The compounds block the action of a hormone, angiotensin II, which has a role in many cases of high blood pressure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> will lead the effort to take the compounds through clinical trials and regulatory reviews. In exchange, the company gets to share with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> world-wide marketing responsibilities and sales revenue.
The other marketing accords comprise two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> products with relatively small sales: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinemet</ENAMEX>, for Parkinson's disease, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaseretic</ENAMEX>, for high blood pressure. That arrangement will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>, whose research pipeline has been paying big dividends in recent years, to free up more of its sales force to concentrate on other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> products. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX>'s part, it gets more drugs to sell while its own products are in earlier stages of development.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> will have exclusive marketing rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sinemet</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> starting in 1990. In 1988, North American sales of the drug were about $100 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX> will obtain exclusive North American marketing rights to Vaseretic starting in 1992 and will jointly promote the drug with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> in certain European countries starting in 1990. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> the drug is marketed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">name Co-Renitec</ENAMEX>. An industry source estimated 1988 sales of the drug in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> at $45 million.
