Citicorp hired Mariel Clemensen of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. to be the head of research at Citicorp's new junk-bond unit.
Ms. Clemensen, age 37, manager of Donaldson's junk-bond research department since 1985, has gained prominence for her willingness to describe conditions in the junk-bond market frankly during its periodic bouts of weakness.
Citicorp, like other banks, received the green light earlier this year from federal bank regulators to underwrite corporate bond issues, including speculative-grade junk bonds. Robert Lawrence, head of its high-yield department, said Citicorp needed a research capability ``to get ready for the public market, to support the sales and trading.''
The bank holding company has yet to underwrite its first public junk-bond issue. But it has made 12 temporary bridge loans totaling $1.1 billion in the past year to help clients complete takeovers. And it has sold several high-yield bond issues privately.
Ms. Clemensen joins a group of about 20 high-yield professionals at Citicorp Securities Markets Inc., Citicorp's broker-dealer. Half of them are salespeople and traders and the remainder are investment bankers seeking deals. She came to Donaldson in 1983 as a utility bond analyst after 11 years at Capital Group, a Los Angeles money manager.
At Citicorp, she said, ``I'm supposed to try to provide the investor viewpoint to the bank's new underwriting powers in creating and selling high-yield securities.
