<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYDNEY</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Australia Ltd.</ENAMEX>, under pressure from bank lenders, has called in accounting firm Peat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwick</ENAMEX> Hungerfords to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company.
Analysts said the move could presage even harsher action by the banks. But any move by the banks to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX>'s management could threaten its ability to operate its national television network under Australian broadcast license rules. That, in turn, could substantially reduce the value of the television assets.
The appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peat Marwick</ENAMEX>, which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies, came about as a result of a round of meetings held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Skase</ENAMEX> with bank creditors.
Yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> said the company is ``solvent and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments.''
Qintex <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Ltd.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex group</ENAMEX>'s problems began in earnest in March, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX> But the transaction faltered in September, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> was forced to increase its offer to US$1.5 billion following a counterbid from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>; the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month.
Qintex <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> owes creditors around A$1.2 billion. Last Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, its 43%-owned U.S. TV production and distribution affiliate, filed for Chapter 11 protection.
