<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble Co.</ENAMEX>, marking its first venture in the cosmetics business, agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell Corp.</ENAMEX> in a stock swap valued at about $1.3 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> consumer products concern, will exchange, on a tax-free basis, 0.272 share of its common for each share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s common and Class B stock. The estimated value is $33.15 a Noxell share, based on last Thursday's closing price for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G. P&G</ENAMEX> will issue 11 million previously authorized shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> shares closed Friday at $119.875, off $2, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell B</ENAMEX> shares surged $10, to $31.25, in national over-the-counter trading. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> common stock is closely held.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hunt Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>, has been controlled by descendants of its founder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Avery Bunting</ENAMEX>, a pharmacist who developed Noxema skin cream in 1917. The company, which also makes best-selling Cover Girl makeup, decided to sell out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> because it needed outside money to improve its research and development and to expand internationally, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George L. Bunting Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive officer.
Completion of the transaction by year end is considered a sure thing because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunting</ENAMEX> family already has given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> irrevocable proxies on about 6.5 million, or 85.6%, of the company's shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> also received options to acquire those shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> is considered a good catch and one that has been looked at by other consumer and health and beauty care concerns, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever N.V.</ENAMEX>, which has been building its cosmetics cabinet through acquisitions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John G. Smale</ENAMEX>, said the acquisition will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> ``to accelerate the growth of our important health and beauty care business.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>'s largest purchases and illustrates its increasing emphasis on buying brands to complement its in-house research. ``Ten or 15 years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> would've introduced a brand new line of cosmetics and gotten killed,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Zurkuhlen</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Bros.</ENAMEX> ``Now they're paying up to buy premium brand.''
Analysts considered the price -- 2.5 times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s annual sales of $522 million -- to be hefty, but not unusual for strong brands. For the first six months of the year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> reported net income of $28.9 million, or 71 cents a share, on sales of $282 million, compared with net of $27 million, or 67 cents a share, on sales of $267.3 million for the first half of 1988.
``It's expensive, but not out of line,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Williams</ENAMEX>, a principal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Consulting Group</ENAMEX> and a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> manager. ``The window of opportunity to buy a major factor in consumer products is narrowing, if not closing.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> has no debt and had about $100 million in cash at year end, officials said.
The deal will be treated as a pooling of interest, which combines the income statements and balance sheets of the two companies and doesn't create any good will.
Analysts expect the purchase to be mildly dilutive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>, perhaps 20 cents or 25 cents a share. Some analysts lowered their 1990 earnings forecasts on the news. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Kozloff</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX>, lowered his estimate to $8.30 a share from $8.50, but left 1991 at $9.75.
Along with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Noxema</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cover Girl</ENAMEX>, Noxell gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P*/NNP&G</ENAMEX> the line of Clarion cosmetics, Lestoil cleaner and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wick</ENAMEX> Fowler Two Alarm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chili</ENAMEX>, a seasoning for chili.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> already has a strong presence in skin care products, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oil of Olay</ENAMEX>, Clearasil and Bain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Soleil</ENAMEX>. But this is its first venture into the $1.5 billion mass market cosmetic business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s Cover Girl and Clarion lines have a combined 25.4% share, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maybelline</ENAMEX>, with 17.7% and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revlon</ENAMEX>, with 13.9%. Those shares are for the ``mass market'' sales, which are through drug and food stores and mass merchandisers. ``They bought the Procter of the cosmetics business,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zurkuhlen</ENAMEX>.
In addition to the mass market brands, other brands of cosmetics are sold in department stores and door-to-door through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Kay</ENAMEX> and Avon brands.
What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> offers is greater distribution through its existing sales networks to retailers. That will be especially helpful in building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s presence in drugstores, where about 55% of mass market cosmetics are sold, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deepak Raj</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Research</ENAMEX>. Only one-third of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s sales now come from drugstore sales, he said.
Nov. 1985 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richardson-Vicks Inc.</ENAMEX>, maker of personal care products including Vicks cold medicines, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX> Price: $1.24 billion.
Dec. 1985 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.D. Searle & Co.</ENAMEX>'s over-the-counter drug business. Price: $300 million.
Dec. 1987 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blendax Group</ENAMEX>, a maker of personal care products, primarily toothbrushes and toothpaste in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mainz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. Price: about $400 million.
March 1989 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundor Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, a maker of fruit drinks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Darien</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn</ENAMEX>. Price: $300 million.
July 1989 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beatrice</ENAMEX>'s Fisher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nut</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> company. Price: about $150 million.
Sept. 1989 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell Corp.</ENAMEX>, a maker of skin care products including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cover Girl</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Noxema</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hunt Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md</ENAMEX>. Price: $1.3 billion in stock.
