<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX> said it will seek to nominate a new slate of directors at the annual meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Containers Ltd.</ENAMEX> in order to further <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>'s $63-a-share, or $963 million, tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Containers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, which is jointly owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stena Holdings AG</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiphook PLC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, said it was ``very disappointed'' that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Containers</ENAMEX> has continued to reject the offer. The annual meeting would provide holders with a ``clear choice'' between the offer and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Containers</ENAMEX>' recapitalization plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> said.
The holding company also said that, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Containers</ENAMEX> didn't hold an annual meeting, it would ``pursue all available remedies,'' including calling a special meeting, to remove the current directors.
