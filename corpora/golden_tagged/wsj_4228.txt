<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian Airlines System</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> announced plans to swap stakes of 5% to 10% in each other under a broad air-traffic and travel-services alliance.
The two carriers said the planned  partnership will give them sufficient critical mass to be among five surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>-based intercontinental carriers in a deregulated air industry of the 1990s. They said planned coordination of their traffic-systems, marketing and other functions would save about 200 million Swedish kronor ($31 million) a year. The gains are expected to multiply as cooperation evolves -- with resulting profits shared equally.
The plan, which was announced simultaneously in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stockholm</ENAMEX>, also is intended to include areas such as catering, hotels, fleet planning and product development. But most of the details remain to be worked out.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> Chief Executive Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Carlzon</ENAMEX> said that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> alliance develops according to plan, the level of cross-ownership will increase in the future. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> said representation on each other's boards may occur. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlzon</ENAMEX> said existing partners such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlines of Britain PLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Austrian Airlines</ENAMEX> could be included in the coordinated air-traffic scheme. In addition, he proposed that Finnair join the group.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlzon</ENAMEX> called Swissair ``an ideal partner'' with a similar strategy focused on business travelers and high-quality service. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swissair</ENAMEX> boasts the extensive long-haul network in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, places where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> is weak.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> said the two airlines initially will increase seat capacity on their flights linking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX> with the three Nordic capitals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX> would then be able to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> and connect onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> flights to, say, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>, while passengers from central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> could fly to Copenhagen to connect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> flights to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. The two airlines could operate joint flights, split up frequencies by time or day or simply harmonize their existing schedules in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> said.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> chief acknowledged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX> hub is less attractive than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> or other European capitals which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> earlier considered as possible gateways for intercontinental routes. A couple of years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> tried very hard to arrange a merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabena.</ENAMEX> Further, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> have different partners in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the new alliance probably won't have much impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Atlantic traffic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> officials said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> last year bought 10% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> as a way of cementing a marketing alliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> concern's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX> unit. Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> had been talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX> about buying more or all of Continental, with U.S. partners. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, in March signed a marketing deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX>. Four months later, the two swapped 5% stakes, Swissair paying about $193 million and Delta about $77 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armin Baltensweiler</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> tie-up gave his company extra incentive to reach an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>. Between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> is closer to its goal of safeguarding its long-term competitiveness.
The agreement, approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX>'s board Wednesday and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> directors yesterday, calls for an exchange of shares, but the exact size of the respective shareholdings will be the subject of further negotiations. So will the composition of the joint executive board that will steer the partnership.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> intend to complete the share swap by the summer. But executives admit they haven't agreed on a method of valuation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>'s complex ownership is another potential pitfall. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX>'s airline is half-owned by the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish governments with the remaining 50% split among publicly traded holding companies in each of the three Nordic countries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> is 23% owned by federal and cantonal authorities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> also said they intend to integrate their hotels under a global travel-service system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> owns 23 hotels directly and holds interests in 105 more through its 40% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intercontinental Hotel Corp.</ENAMEX> acquired earlier this year.
