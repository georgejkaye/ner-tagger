<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>'s President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Sarney</ENAMEX> said his government has made ``a tremendous effort'' to reduce spending and can't make further cuts.
That suggests that the Third World's biggest debtor is still far from winning agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a new lending package. In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> is ``struggling to get an agreement.'' But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> wants further austerity measures from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> if it is to strike a new accord.
During the interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> voiced concerns about his country's international debt condition, but he suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> soon will take steps to ease its recent trade friction with the U.S. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> to address the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>.
A short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> agreement could free billions of dollars of loans from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>, commercial banks and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. These loans have been blocked by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>'s failure to meet deficit and inflation targets it adopted as part of a previous agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>.
Citing the need to conserve foreign exchange, Brazil last week failed to make a scheduled $1.6 billion interest payment to its international banks.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> for not being more willing to reach agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>, saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> officials believe ``that they should only negotiate with the {next} administration.'' Brazilians go to the polls in mid-November to elect a new president, who is expected to take office in March.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>'s political transition ``shouldn't interrupt the process'' of sorting out its debt difficulties, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> argued. He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s inaction ``certainly doesn't contribute to the democratic process, it disturbs the democratic process.'' He added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, ``have done their best to help.''
``With the Bush administration there's a new esprit,'' a greater openness to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX>, who met with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> Monday. The two leaders discussed trade and environmental problems, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> said, adding that they agreed to work together through international agencies to solve trade disputes.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> said his country shortly would publish new tariff regulations, but he didn't provide details. The U.S. in May cited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> under the tough Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade law for its import licensing practices. That provision carries the threat of U.S. trade retaliation if cited trade barriers aren't removed through negotiations within 18 months.
``This is seen as a very positive step for removing the threat of Super 301,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> of the coming new tariff rules. ``What we hear from {the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Trade Office</ENAMEX>} is the need for positive movement toward lower tariffs.''
The president wasn't optimistic about his country's debt situation. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> is suffering from ``a negative Marshall plan'' -- it is paying out sums equal to 4% of its gross domestic product every year to foreign creditors. There has been a net flow of $56 billion from Brazil the past five years, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> debt is a political problem ``for which a solution must be found,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarney</ENAMEX> said. If not, the democratic process in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> will be threatened, he added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, with its huge surpluses, doesn't offer a solution to debt difficulties, he added. He said that country is like ``the horizon: You chase after it but never quite catch it.''
