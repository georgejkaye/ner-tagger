In the aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> massacre on June 4, economists advanced wildly divergent views on how <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> would be affected.
Among the most upbeat was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT Brokerage</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia) Ltd.</ENAMEX> In a June 5 reaction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX> unit proclaimed the economy ``shockproof.''
Others were more cautious. In a July analysis titled ``From <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Euphoria</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Despair</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.I. Carr</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">) Ltd.</ENAMEX>, another securities firm, said that eroding confidence might undermine future economic development.
Today, with business activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> staggering along at an uneven pace, the economy itself seems locked in a struggle between hope and fear.
Manufacturers have survived the turmoil in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> largely unscathed. Signs of revival seem evident in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s hard-hit hotel sector. But in the stock and real-estate markets, activity remains spotty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground. Waning demand reported by importers, retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt.
As many economists and businessmen see it, those incongruities underscore a paradox that seems likely to bedevil the economy throughout the 1990s. That paradox is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s economically rewarding yet politically perilous relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
As a model of capitalist efficiency on southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s doorstep, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s prospects look good. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>-bound freight streams through the territory's port. In the decade since the communist nation emerged from isolation, its burgeoning trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> has lifted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s status as a regional business center. These benefits seem secure despite <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s current economic and political troubles. But to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> isn't purely business. It is also the sovereign power that, come 1997, will take over this British colony. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation's democracy movement.
Outflows of people and capital from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s. A widely held assumption all along has been that, given its robust economy, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows. With interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since June 4, that assumption no longer seems so safe.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX> and emigration plans take time to come to fruition. Only four months have passed since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> massacre, and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact. The only consensus is that more money and people may leave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> than had been thought likely. This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy's prospects. The question, as many people see it, is how long such uncertainty will last.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Fraser</ENAMEX>, an economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.I. Carr</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque Indosuez</ENAMEX>, believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997. It may experience an upswing or two in between. But with local investors shaken by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s political and economic turmoil, she says, a genuine recovery may not arrive until <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> can prove itself secure under Chinese sovereignty.
``Investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to 1997,'' she says. ``Over the next few years, I would advise caution.''
In a soon-to-be published book on the territory, a political economist, Miron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX>, has derived three future scenarios from interviews with 41 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government officials and businessmen. Nearly half of them argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s uneasy relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long-term economic growth. The rest are split roughly between optimists who expect <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos.
The interviews took place two years ago. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> crisis erupted, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX> says, the scenario as depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> currently faces. The consensus of this group, which he dubs ``realists,'' is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between 3% and 5%.
Such a pace of growth, though respectable for mature industrialized economies, would be unusually slow for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. Only twice since the 1960s has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below 5% for two or more consecutive years. The first instance occurred in 1967-68, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> triggered bloody street rioting in the colony. The other came in 1974-75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash. During the past 10 years, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s economic growth has averaged 8.3% annually. Given <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s record, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX>'s ``realists'' might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago. Under the current circumstances, he says, their scenario no longer seems unrealistic.
``The city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor. It could lose some of its dynamism,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX>, a director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baring Securities</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">) Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barings PLC</ENAMEX>. ``It doesn't have to be a disaster. It just means that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> would become a less exciting place.''
Going by official forecasts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDP</ENAMEX>, which measures the colony's output of goods and services, minus foreign income, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mushkat</ENAMEX>'s ``realists'' seem relatively close to the mark. After taking into account the fallout from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> crisis, the government has projected 1989 GDP growth of 5%. The updated forecast, published Aug. 25, compares with an earlier forecast of 6% published March 1 and a 7.4% rate achieved in
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piers Jacobs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s financial secretary, says a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally. ``We aren't looking at anything like a doomsday scenario,'' he says. ``But clearly we're entering a difficult period.''
Many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s economy. One concerns Japanese investors. Barely visible on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s property scene in 1985, by last year <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> had become the top foreign investor, spending $602 million. The market has grown relatively quiet since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> crisis. But if the Japanese return in force, their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors' waning commitment.
Another -- and critical -- factor is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s biggest export market. Even before the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> crisis, weak U.S. demand was slowing local economic growth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conversely</ENAMEX>, strong consumer spending in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> two years ago helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate.
Indeed, a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s economic rhythm. Once external conditions, such as U.S. demand, swing in the territory's favor, they argue, local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual.
But economic arguments, however solid, won't necessarily impress <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s 5.7 million people. Many are refugees, having fled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> took power in 1949. As a result, many of those now planning to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> can't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony's political and economic climate.
Emigration applications soared in 1985, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> ratified their accord on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s future. In 1987, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s most prosperous year for a decade, 30,000 left, up 58% from the previous year. Last year, 45,000 went. The government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as 60,000 -- a projection that is widely regarded as unrealistically low. A large number of those leaving are managers and professionals. While no one professes to know the exact cost of such a ``brain drain'' to the economy, hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat.
``When the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members, economic growth is bound to be affected,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthong Wong</ENAMEX>, an economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hang Seng Bank</ENAMEX>.
