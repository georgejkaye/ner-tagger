On a recent visit here, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> trumpeted his new plan to attack the Latin American debt crisis. The July agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> and its foreign banks, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> said, had already won over a key group of converts: moneyed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicans</ENAMEX> who have taken billions of dollars out of their homeland and squirreled the funds away abroad. ``Significant amounts of capital have been moving back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> said.
Two days later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coronado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, realtor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Lomas</ENAMEX> was also savoring a triumph. She had just sold a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico City</ENAMEX> industrialist a $400,000 property on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coronado Cays</ENAMEX>, a palm-fringed cluster of homes with docks at the doors. ``Nothing in the world can slow down our Mexican business,'' she said, slipping the sale papers into an international courier's envelope.
Unfortunately for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lomas</ENAMEX> is probably closer to the truth than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> debt program, the first test of the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady Plan</ENAMEX> to manage Latin <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s $400 billion debt, has a simple premise: International backing for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s market-oriented economic reforms, along with a modest amount of financial aid, will trigger a surge of new investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s prostrate economy. In particular, Mexican policy makers hope to repatriate money that their countrymen hold abroad -- some $84 billion, according to a 1988 estimate by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Guaranty Trust</ENAMEX>.
But those who work in the business built around so-called flight capital say that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s missing billions aren't likely to come home anytime soon, if ever. Mexican capital has become deeply rooted abroad, not only in bank accounts but in fixed investments ranging from art galleries to auto dealerships. And while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s government is trying to lure the capital back through a combination of incentives and intimidation, some of the world's leading financial institutions are working overtime to hang onto the money, and their valued Mexican clients.
``Getting that capital back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> will be like trying to reverse the law of gravity,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernardo Jordan</ENAMEX>, a Mexican businessman who lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> and has investments on both sides of the border. Cheered by the reform program of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s new, pro-business president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> recently invested in two restaurants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>. But he hasn't been able to persuade friends to join him. ``The big money is staying out,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> says.
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brady</ENAMEX> accord, banks have the choice of making new loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> or swapping their loans for bonds. The new bonds would carry either a below-market interest rate or a discount on the value of the original loan. Last week, new questions arose about the plan's viability. Three big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> banks sharply increased reserves for losses on Third World loans, which many analysts took as a sign that they may simply cut their losses, spurning the option of making new loans. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.P. Morgan & Co.</ENAMEX> increased its reserves by $2 billion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX> by $1.15 billion and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> by $950 million.
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> will need fresh loans to fuel growth; without them, capital repatriation becomes even more important, but less likely. ``A lot of {<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s} small investors aren't going to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> again until the big foreign companies put their money there,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Sepulveda</ENAMEX>, a Mexican who runs an import-export company out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> has suffered the region's biggest capital outflows, but the problem afflicts all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Guaranty</ENAMEX> estimated that, as of the end of 1987, $159 billion was held abroad by South Americans, mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venezuelans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentines</ENAMEX>. By most estimates, the value of Latin American capital investment in the U.S. far exceeds the amount of loans to the region held by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> banks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank</ENAMEX>, for example, the largest lender to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, has $7.7 billion in credits outstanding. But it also has roughly $20 billion in deposits made by Latin Americans through its international, private banking network, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James S. Henry</ENAMEX>, former chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mckinsey & Co.</ENAMEX>, who has written on capital flight.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, Mexican investors have bought everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> lofts to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> lodges. But the capital of the capital flight industry may be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>. ``Many parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> don't realize how much of their prosperity they owe to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s crisis,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Todd</ENAMEX>, a partner in the accounting firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newport Beach</ENAMEX>. Mexicans own an estimated 25% of the real estate in pricey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coronado</ENAMEX> island, where rows of beachfront condominiums have been snapped up, has turned into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ellis Island</ENAMEX> of the Mexican elite.
``Even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brady Plan</ENAMEX> makes Mexico a better place to invest, can it compare to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>?'' asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Javier Benito</ENAMEX>, a Mexican real-estate developer who now lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla</ENAMEX>. Back in 1981, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benito</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> finishing his biggest project, the towering headquarters of the government import-export bank, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> devalued the peso, ruining his company. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benito</ENAMEX> pulled up stakes and set up business in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla</ENAMEX>.
Now, he has grown attached to his adopted home. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benito</ENAMEX>'s children have attended good U.S. universities. He spends his free time with a social club, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Latin Professionals</ENAMEX>, formed by 100 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>-area expatriates. And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benito</ENAMEX> is busy with his own economic plan: marketing a machine that determines whether a tennis ball has fallen outside the foul line. ``My tennis project has me more excited than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brady</ENAMEX> plan,'' he says.
That's not to say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady Plan</ENAMEX> hasn't aided <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s economy. It triggered a surge of new optimism in the country, which helped the government reduce the high interest rates it had to pay to keep skittish investors from sending more money abroad. Rates on the country's 28-day treasury bills, for example, dropped sharply -- to 34% from 57%. Nonetheless, interest rates remain high and most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s savings are in volatile, short-term instruments. And it was a bad omen that the government last week canceled an auction of treasury bills because of new, upward pressure on rates.
``This deal has bought Salinas some time, but that's all,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodolfo Fernandez</ENAMEX>, an international accountant for Touche <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>, who has helped Mexicans set up an array of U.S. businesses. ``Even if you're the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> or the secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX>, you can't move capital by decree.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>, the economist, argues that the Latin upper class, foreign financial institutions and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government all share the blame for perpetuating a system that foments capital flight and benefits all but the Latin poor. With their money invested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, secure from shocks in their debt-ridden homelands, the Latin wealthy grow wealthier, widening inequities in a region where income distribution is already badly skewed. By aggressively courting Mexican clients, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> banks obtain deposits to cover bad loans to the third world. And by declaring most investments by non-resident aliens tax-free, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government, burdened by its budget deficit, attracts valuable investment dollars.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady Plan</ENAMEX> doesn't address the underlying structural problems that have turned the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> into one of the world's biggest tax havens,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>.
Capital began leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> in the late 1970s, during the borrowing binge of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Lopez Portillo</ENAMEX>. In 1981, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> received $20 billion in loans and, by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>'s reckoning, lost $9 billion to $11 billion in capital flight. What money remained in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> poured out after 1982 when, to spite the ``sacadolares'' -- those sending their money abroad -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lopez Portillo</ENAMEX> nationalized the banks, many of which were owned by these investors. His intention was to punish; but, in the end, he only worsened the capital flight. By 1986, so much money had left the country that the Mexican newspaper Excelsior was able to publish a government-leaked list of 575 Mexicans with deposits of at least $1 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madrid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>. Some fortunes were far larger. Mexican authorities have found foreign real-estate worth about $70 million held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sergio Bolanos</ENAMEX>, financial front man for the notoriously corrupt oilworkers union. The holdings include a castle in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and a lavish compound in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vail</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo</ENAMEX>.
Moving large amounts of money requires the skill of professionals, who have been happy to lend their services. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valdemar de Murguia</ENAMEX>, a Mexican who came to the U.S. to study at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>, was one of those professionals. Impressed by his contacts among the rich in the expatriate community, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fenner & Smith</ENAMEX> quickly hired him after graduation to recruit Mexican clients. His technique was simple: Open the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico City</ENAMEX> Yellow Pages and call up the presidents of the companies that had the biggest ads. ``If you didn't come back from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> with $1 million in investments, the trip was considered a failure,'' he says. ``But the competition was very rough.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Murguia</ENAMEX> once arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico City</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towering Hotel Nikko</ENAMEX>, to find that 17 other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> brokers, from offices all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, were also doing business. He befriended a stewardess who operated on a more modest scale, supplementing her income by moving dozens of small accounts -- those of secretaries, beauticians and factory workers -- to the U.S. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Murguia</ENAMEX> has since left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> and opened his own import-export firm.
Under Mexican law, foreign brokerage agents can't solicit clients in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>. A Mexican finance official, however, says, ``In the era of electronic money transfers, it's almost impossible to regulate capital flows.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.E. Woodward</ENAMEX>, chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> office, said he isn't aware of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> employees currently soliciting business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, though he says he is relatively new in his position and can't speak to what occurred in the past.
In the wake of the announcement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady Plan</ENAMEX>, many brokers have been hitting the Mexican circuit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raul Guzman</ENAMEX>, a businessman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico City</ENAMEX>, has gotten five calls from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> investment specialists in the past month. ``Whenever there's news on the debt, the bankers come,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman</ENAMEX>, who adds that his savings are in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>. And what do the bankers advise? ``Take your money out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, but quickly.''
Once the money moves out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, the momentum often is against repatriating it. Wolf <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bielas</ENAMEX>, 25 years old, left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> City three years ago and, with a stake from his father, founded a chain of computer equipment stores called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Outlet</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> area. Business has been good, he says. ``We want to expand to the north, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, up the whole coast.'' And what of south of the border? ``I haven't honestly been paying much attention to the investment climate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>,'' he says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s energetic President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> is certainly trying to get the sacadolares' attention. A few days after the debt accord, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> unveiled a tax amnesty program for Mexican investors who repatriate capital. (In almost all cases, investors have failed to report income from investments abroad.) At the same time, the government has been wielding a stick. At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s urging, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has acted for the first time to extradite three Mexican industrialists from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coronado</ENAMEX> on tax-evasion charges.
Cross-border cooperation is expanding in other ways. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexican</ENAMEX> officials say they will soon sign an agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> that will give them data on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> bank and property holdings of Mexicans suspected of tax evasion. ``This new cooperation between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is scaring my clients,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Vilaplana</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> lawyer who advises Mexican investors.
But some bankers say that a crackdown on the sacadolares will only send Mexican money into more discreet offshore shelters. Mexican industrialists with investments on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Grande</ENAMEX> have already developed sophisticated techniques for repatriating just enough capital to keep their Mexican businesses going. So much money enters <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> through shell companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cayman Islands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>, for example, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, never a particularly big player in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, has suddenly emerged as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s second-largest foreign investor.
With the prospects for forced capital repatriation doubtful, many analysts say that the burden will be on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> to make ever more dramatic reforms to spark new confidence in the economy, and thus lure capital back the free-market way. This is at best a delicate balancing act.
For instance, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> recently used military force rather than negotiating finesse to bust a recalcitrant union at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s largest mine. That strong-arm tactic drew cheers from the sacadolares, but strained Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX>'s already tenuous relationship with labor.
``How much money comes back, and how soon, all depends on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> continues to play this very dangerous game with the same skill he's shown so far,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zack Chayet</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexican</ENAMEX> lawyer who lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> and has contacts with big expatriate investors. ``But isn't that about where we were before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady Plan</ENAMEX>?''
