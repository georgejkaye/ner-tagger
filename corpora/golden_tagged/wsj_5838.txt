<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle Eastern Corp.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to sell its downtown real estate for about $400 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JMB Realty Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, capping off more than $2.4 billion of asset disposals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX> inherited the real estate -- including three office buildings, a shopping mall and a hotel -- from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Eastern Corp.</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX> acquired earlier this year for $3.22 billion. Since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX>, a large natural-gas pipeline company, has been selling off assets to reduce debt. The largest single asset shed was a package of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Sea</ENAMEX> oil properties that went for $961 million.
``We're done with the big-ticket items,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Hunsucker</ENAMEX> said in an interview following announcement of the real-estate sale. ``We've got some other things to sell but not of that magnitude.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunsucker</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX> plans to sell by year end smaller assets he valued at about $150 million -- the largest of which is a 50,000-barrel-a-day oil refinery. He expects that sale to close by Oct. 1.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX> recently pre-paid a $1.7 billion bridge loan used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Eastern</ENAMEX> acquisition, leaving it with about $1.2 billion of takeover-related debt. ``We'll be chipping away on that,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunsucker</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> real estate, which includes large undeveloped acreage fronting the city convention center, sold much quicker than expected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX> said the long-depressed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> market improved enough this year to generate more interest than anticipated.
Some real-estate experts suggested that with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> real estate showing signs of recovery, it wouldn't be sensible for the company to be a seller now. ``It wouldn't if we were in the real-estate business,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunsucker</ENAMEX> countered. ``But we're in the pipeline business.'' He added, ``We just did not have the luxury of time.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX>'s only sizable asset not part of the gas-pipeline business is a petroleumproducts pipeline. Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunsucker</ENAMEX> maintained that wasn't for sale, he said he has had many inquiries about it. He placed its value ``probably north of $600 million.''
The buyer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> properties, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JMB Realty</ENAMEX>, is a real-estate investment, development and management firm. Assets in its own portfolio and those it manages for affiliates total more than $20 billion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Eastern</ENAMEX>'s corporate headquarters has been in one of the sold office buildings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle</ENAMEX> said it will relocate personnel there to its headquarters during a three-year period. The merged company will have reduced the number of employees by around 600 people to 2,200 by year's end, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunsucker</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunsucker</ENAMEX> said the company is open to other acquisition possibilities but wasn't looking under rocks to find them. ``I'm like one of those big snakes,'' he said. ``I don't need to eat every month. I need a little time for the digestion process.
