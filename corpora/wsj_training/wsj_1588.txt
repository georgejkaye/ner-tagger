I was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>'s Brave Publisher.'' It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers, not the left wing. This information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region. Past Colombian government tolerance of the ``narcotraficantes'' was due to the drug lords' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands.

I suggest that The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> (as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind) should put its money where its mouth is: Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Espectador</ENAMEX>, buy ad space, publish stories under the bylines of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Espectador</ENAMEX> journalists. Perhaps an arrangement could be worked out to ``sponsor'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Espectador</ENAMEX> journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories. Reward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Espectador</ENAMEX>'s courage with real support.
