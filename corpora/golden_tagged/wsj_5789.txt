Slow sales are prompting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> to place buyer incentives on its much ballyhooed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> Super Coupe and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> Cougar <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">XR</ENAMEX>-7, which were named Car of the Year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Trend Magazine</ENAMEX>. The two models share many of the same features.
Effective last Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> offered $1,500 cash back to Super Coupe and XR-7 purchasers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> hadn't previously offered incentives on those models. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> spokesman confirmed that the company is adding the incentives in an attempt to boost sales of the models.
The company also increased the cash back allowance to $750, from $500 on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probe GL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LX</ENAMEX> models. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> also increased the incentive on its Probe GT model to $1,000, from $500.
In lieu of the cash-back offerings, buyers may elect to participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s interest-rate finance program, which features discounted rates ranging from 2.9% to 10.9%, depending on terms.
