Hyde <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athletic Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silvershoe Acquisition Corp.</ENAMEX> offered to terminate an agreement to acquire Hyde at $8.50 a share.
The offer is subject to the understanding that the termination won't prejudice any rights and claims the parties may have with respect to the merger agreement, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX>, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peabody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Fisher</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive, said the offer will be presented to the company's board for consideration.
Hyde previously said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silvershoe</ENAMEX>'s bank financing commitment appeared to fall short of the amount needed to close the transaction, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyde</ENAMEX> spokesman said yesterday that Hyde believes that continues to be the case.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hyde</ENAMEX>, maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saucony</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PF Flyer</ENAMEX> and other athletic shoes, had 2.8 million shares outstanding on June 30.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Hyde closed at $5.375, down 25 cents.
