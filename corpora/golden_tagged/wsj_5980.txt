The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> network, which has been locked out of the financially lucrative late-night market, is studying program proposals, ranging from comedy to news shows, to air in the time slot after its highly rated ``Nightline.''
Late-night success has eluded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX> subsidiary for the last five years. A one-hour ``Nightline'' quickly bombed, as did talk shows with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Jackson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Breslin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cavett</ENAMEX>. The most recent attempt, ``Day's End,'' which offered a review of the day's news and highlights from the network's ``Good Morning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'' talk show, was dropped last spring after 13 weeks of market testing in 28 cities.
Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> ceases programming at midnight and the network's 200-plus affiliates program the late-night period themselves, generally with syndicated shows or movies. By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX>'s affiliates air ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Sajak</ENAMEX> Show'' and affiliates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> get ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonight</ENAMEX> Show'' and ``Late Night With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Letterman</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> hopes to have a project ready to show stations at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">January</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Television Programming</ENAMEX> Executives convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Orleans</ENAMEX>, where syndicators hawk their new shows. Among the proposals ABC is studying are four comedy-oriented shows, which are typically a hit with men aged 18-34, the demographic group most desired by advertisers.
``Products like soft drinks, shampoo, sneakers, beer and beauty-care products are all looking for late-night shows to reach their audience,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Croasdale</ENAMEX>, senior vice president and director of network sales at the ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX> ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> has yet to get a foothold in that door and it must. It's just too valuable a time period to keep ignoring.''
Last year, programs airing after 11:30 p.m. accounted for $429 million in total advertising revenues for the three networks, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> earned only about $61 million. Late-night competition for young adults has increased recently, especially with the addition of ``The Arsenio <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> Show,'' syndicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Television</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> may cut the 90-minute ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Sajak</ENAMEX> Show'' to one-hour and air a comedy-oriented show at 12:30 a.m.
Among the hosts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> is looking at for comedy projects are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Dees</ENAMEX>, a popular <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> disk jockey, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Macgregor</ENAMEX>, a former host of the canceled syndicated show ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Dating Game</ENAMEX>,'' and standup comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Meaney</ENAMEX>. Another possible show involves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Markoe</ENAMEX>, who was once head writer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s ``Late Night With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Letterman</ENAMEX>.''
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koppel Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, an independent production company headed by ``Nightline'' anchor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Koppel</ENAMEX>, has offered a proposal for a one-hour, news-oriented program, a spokeswoman for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koppel</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Croasdale</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> would face a tough task if it tried to follow a news broadcast with an entertainment show because of the different audiences the shows attract. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Brockman</ENAMEX>, president of late-night, daytime and children's programming at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, acknowledged the juxtaposition could pose a problem. ``The dilemma we face in creating a midnight show is one created by the success of'Nightline,' ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brockman</ENAMEX> said. ``There isn't really enough advertiser support for another news show. And there isn't any intelligent way to extend'Nightline,' so I've decided to create a program in which I'll have to recruit almost an entirely new audience.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> won't produce ``a talk show per se with a desk and sofa,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brockman</ENAMEX>, who, prior to joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, launched ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Sajak</ENAMEX> Show'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>. ``We're tapping the strengths of the personalities involved with each project.''
Some affiliates said they were skeptical about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s potential for success. One reason is that the affiliates have purchased syndicated programs and movie packages and are unwilling to move those shows for an untested ABC project.
``I just spent millions of dollars last year on a movie package that would last me five years,'' said an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> affiliate general manager, who asked not be identified. ``I don't think I would initially take something offered by the network.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brockman</ENAMEX> admitted that support among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> affiliates would be an ``uphill battle,'' mostly because the network in the past has failed to demonstrate long-term support for any program that followed ``Nightline.''
``Because of the past inconsistency, {the affiliates} have a'show me' attitude and I don't blame them,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brockman</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> can't even count on the eight stations it owns, since they are allowed to run autonomously. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WABC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> didn't run the programs hosted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breslin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cavett</ENAMEX> when the network aired them, and ran a syndicated talk show, since canceled, with comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Brenner</ENAMEX> instead.
