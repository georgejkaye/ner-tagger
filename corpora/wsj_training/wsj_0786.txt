<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> completed its $3 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical International Inc.</ENAMEX>, purchasing 63 million shares, or 86%, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based health-care services concern for $26.50 a share. The price also includes assumption of about $1.4 billion in debt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> is a group that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pritzker</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> through the leveraged buy-out fund Harry Gray <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melvyn Klein & Partners</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry J. Gray</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melvyn N. Klein</ENAMEX>, along with five other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> designees, were named to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX>'s 10-member board.
The completion of the merger agreement follows months of twists and turns. In January, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> brought in a new chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A. Gilleland</ENAMEX>, 45, who will remain as chairman, president and chief executive. A few days later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> announced sharply lower earnings, taking charges of $24 million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases.
In March, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> received a $24-a-share offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Lee Pearce</ENAMEX>. It also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price. A group including several members of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bass</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value.
The following month, the company put itself up for sale. It received more offers, but the auction was surprisingly won by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX>, which bid $28 a share and asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilleland</ENAMEX> to stay on as an equity participant. He indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt.
Then, after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling, IMA early this month lowered its offer to $26.50 a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> accepted the offer, meanwhile indicating it had heard from two other suitors. But they never materialized and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> completed the purchase yesterday.
Other new board members include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John S. Harrison</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark A. Adley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James F. Lyons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S. Goldberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold S. Handelsman</ENAMEX>.
