The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit may worsen next year, after two years of significant improvement.
In its report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on international economic policies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade, known as the current account, ``is likely at best to be very modest,'' and ``the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year can not be excluded.''
The statement was the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government's first acknowledgement of what other groups, such as the International Monetary Fund, have been predicting for months. Continued strength in the dollar was cited as one reason the trade position may deteriorate.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s report, which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act, again took <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> to task for its exchange-rate policies. ``We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate `manipulation''' during the past six months, it said, citing the lack of market forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>'s exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> expressed pleasure, however, with the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year's report. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has liberalized its exchange rate system in the past year.
