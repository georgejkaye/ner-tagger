On an office wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> intelligence committee hangs a quote from Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX>, ``Don't hold your ticket'til the show's over.'' He once used that line in a closed-door meeting on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>, meaning don't shrink from taking action against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX>.
So how did a good senator like this end up approving a policy that required the U.S. to warn Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> of any coup plot against him? ``I agree, it's ridiculous,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX>, and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> decides to take -- or rather, not to take -- covert action.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> disclosed the policy last week by reading it to GOP senators, perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> fiasco to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. But the broader truth is more complicated -- and dismaying. The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> intelligence committee and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX>. Staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> could not do to oust the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> thug. They simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> himself didn't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told him privately at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> last week.
It's ironic that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> should be in the center of this mire. A former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> governor, he's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy. He's a rare Democratic hawk. He's the senator most like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Vandenberg</ENAMEX>, the GOP senator from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vandenberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rayburn</ENAMEX> are heroes of mine,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> says, referring as well to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Rayburn</ENAMEX>, the Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> speaker who cooperated with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX>. ``They allowed this country to be credible. I really want to see that happen again.'' If this were 1949, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> might even succeed. But in 1989 most senators have other ideas. Last July, his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan to support a coup in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> Democrat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Metzenbaum</ENAMEX> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt, a charming notion for a great power. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> Republican <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> said the plan might violate the assassination ban. So the administration dropped it. By October, when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal, even the administration was agreeing little should be done.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> doesn't think all this influenced the failed coup this month, but he does concede that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has made mistakes. ``In the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, in the aftermath of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>-Contra, I can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup, they have to bring their lawyers,'' he says.
But even Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> defends congressional oversight. Writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard International Review</ENAMEX>, he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there's a ``consensus.''
So what does consensus mean? ``It doesn't mean unanimous,'' he insists, though he implies it means a bipartisan majority. ``The sustainability of U.S. foreign policy is essential,'' he explains. ``Why was containment so successful? Because it had bipartisan support.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Abrams</ENAMEX>, a veteran of intelligence committee debates, doubts that even Grenada or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libyan</ENAMEX> raid would have taken place if ``consensus'' had been required. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vandenberg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rayburn</ENAMEX> were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents; modern senators, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> notwithstanding, are less modest.
The result is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action. ``I wouldn't say it's quite a veto,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> demurs. But wouldn't a president who acted despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> objections be taking grave political risks? ``He would,'' agrees the chairman. ``But that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> even spies a silver lining. He figures the episode will help ``clarify any ambiguities'' between the committee and administration. He points to a letter on his desk, his second in a week from President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, saying that they ``don't disagree.'' More broadly, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> will shock <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> out of its fear of using military power. ``Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force,'' he says.
Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX>. But it's just as plausible to argue that if even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> can get mired in this sort of mess, the problem goes beyond legal interpretation. Maybe the problem is a political system that won't act without an ``exchange of letters,'' that insists on running foreign policy by committee, that treats a president as just another guy at the table.
The reply of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Metzenbaums</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohens</ENAMEX> is that we can't abolish these oversight committees because we've seen too many abuses of executive power. But Panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock. The lawyers are now in charge of our national security. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests at stake were happily minor; the only people killed were foreigners hapless enough to trust American will. Americans may not be so lucky the next time.
