<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX>, responding to growing global competitive pressures, has created a business unit that will place increased emphasis on software development.
Long recognized as a leading semiconductor maker and defense contractor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> recently has been in the economic doldrums because of softening markets in both areas. Meanwhile, the company's digital product line, consisting largely of consumer products, has posted losses for more than two years.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Technology Group</ENAMEX> will integrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX>' information systems, minicomputer and industrial automation groups. President of the new group is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W. White</ENAMEX>, who becomes a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX>. The group's primary purpose will be to ``break the software development logjam'' by creating software that will ``let computers write and generate software code,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX> said.
Company officials acknowledge that the new group has ``no new products, as such,'' but instead will facilitate ``integration of what we already have'' in response to growing market demand for more advanced information and automation systems. It also marks a first step toward reorientation of the troubled digital products segment, a move that was urged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry R. Junkins</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer, at the last annual meeting.
