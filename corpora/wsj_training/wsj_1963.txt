Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> version in advance of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference broke down.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> leaders had hoped to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s lead by getting an agreement from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> committee chairmen under which they would drop items that wouldn't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-passed bill before the negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> began.
But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues, ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance. ``Many members feel there are important features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> bill that should be enacted,'' Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>) said. ``If there is any support for reducing the bill, it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form.''
Now those items will be discussed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference, which could begin as soon as today, with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation. ``You've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Budget Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>). ``This is a democratic process -- you can't slam-dunk anything around here.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Budget</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> has said he would continue to press to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> drops many of its costly provisions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> by the end of the week, but Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> said that wasn't likely.
Failure to pass the bill meant that $16.1 billion in across-the-board spending cuts took effect Monday under the Gramm-Rudman budget law. The bill must be enacted before the cuts can be restored.
