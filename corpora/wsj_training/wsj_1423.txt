When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> upheld <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>'s abortion restrictions last July, the justices almost certainly didn't have drunk driving, trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds.
But the 5-4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights.
The decision, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproductive Health Services</ENAMEX>, illustrates how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rulings often have a ripple effect, spreading into areas of law and policy that weren't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> case, unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state's 1986 abortion law. The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution.
Last year, a federal appeals court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> said the preamble was unconstitutional, citing an earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling that states can't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life hadn't yet been used to restrict abortion services.
The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws. Already, local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reproductive Health Services</ENAMEX>, an abortion clinic in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>.
The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children. Under a 1981 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> law, persons accused of some crimes, including trespassing, may offer a defense that their actions were justified ``as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury.'' Relying on the preamble's statement that a fetus is an unborn child, the two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis County Circuit Court</ENAMEX> judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives.
In another case, a protester, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann O'Brien</ENAMEX>, was convicted of trespass before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> ruling. Last week, when her appeal was argued before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri Court of Appeals</ENAMEX>, her lawyer also relied on the preamble.
``The effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>, and I think this is one of the cracks,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Belz</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> lawyer who represented Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> protesters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s 1973 decision that recognized a woman's right to abortion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Mandina</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> Lawyers for Life, says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass, ``This will shut down abortion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>. There's no risk to the protesters, and you can't keep an abortion clinic open if there are 3,000 people standing outside every day.''
That would be an ironic result of a case in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> expressly stopped short of overruling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>.
In two other cases, the possible consequences of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling appear even more unintended.
In one, the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>, who was charged with drunk driving, argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception, not from birth. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>, those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked for one year, while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension. A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boone County</ENAMEX> judge rejected the motion, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Dodson</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jefferson City</ENAMEX> lawyer, says he has appealed.
And in a case filed in federal court in August, a lawyer is arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery.
