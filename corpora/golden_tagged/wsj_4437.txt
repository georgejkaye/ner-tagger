Forty years of cheap Soviet energy, Warsaw Pact security and imported Russian culture have hardly made Imre and Imrene happy to be citizens of the East bloc.
For the husband-and-wife managers of a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Budapest</ENAMEX> laundry, ``East bloc'' means Soviet-made laundry equipment that barely works, currency that can't buy better replacements and an income that hardly feeds the family.
The way out? ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> has to rejoin the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imre</ENAMEX>, a soft-spoken, 49-year-old father of two who asked that his family name not be published. ``We are not part of the East,'' protests Imrene as she attacks wrinkles on a woman's winter coat. ``The sooner we rejoin the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, the better off we all will be.''
This burning desire to unite with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> seems to engulf all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> these days. From the chamber of commerce and the government to shoppers in working-class markets, much talk is about reviving prewar ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> faces staggering obstacles in its efforts to shed its East bloc shackles, many business and political leaders have resolved that it must be done.
``We are beginning a new phase of East-West relations,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Medgyessy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>'s vice prime minister. The reform-minded Communist government of which he is a part hopes the party can win a significant block of seats in parliament in free elections expected next spring.
All this is hardly surprising. Once a leading European cultural and political center, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> since World War II has been repressed politically, deprived technologically and gutted economically. Its 10 million people are burdened with an $18 billion debt, stuck with a defunct infrastructure and a technologically untrained work force.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Budapest</ENAMEX> offices, secretaries often work in groups to make a single call on one of the country's huge, pea-green telephone ``machines,'' which have plenty of levers and flashing lights but a poor record of finding a free line. The average citizen stuggles to get by on a monthly income of less than $150.
``We look across the border and see that everything is better,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Nagyantal</ENAMEX>, a 21-year-old student, as she strolls across a tree-lined university courtyard. ``People have smiles on their faces, their clothes are nicer and the shops are full of wonderful things.''
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> isn't likely to leave the Warsaw Pact anytime soon, some Communist bosses say it may someday declare official neutrality and pursue a path like that of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX>. That could be even more likely after the coming elections, though some experts say it could be delayed by a relatively strong showing at the polls by the Communists. Current estimates show the Communists holding as much as 30% of the vote.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>'s mating dance with the West fails, some experts fear the country could be plunged into social unrest. The government has warned that without Western help, worsening economic troubles could force the country to delay democratic reforms, such as the elections. Other political experts fear that widespread strikes or demonstrations could result in a military crackdown.
Yet this courtship makes some Westerners nervous. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> officials fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> may depart the East so boldly that it will start pushing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> membership -- a stated goal of some Hungarian opposition politicians. With controversial applications from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX> already in hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> leaders find themselves in the curious role of trying to cool Hungarian advances.
This yearning for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> is hardly new, but it has strengthened in this era of perestroika and glasnost. This summer the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarians</ENAMEX> began ripping down the barbed-wire fence along their border with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX>. Within weeks, thousands of East Germans poured through the opening. And rather than stop the flow, as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> demanded, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> defiantly kept its borders open.
``We think it is natural to open the gates,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnes Toth</ENAMEX>, a spokeswoman in the government press office. ``It's not because we like or hate a particular system. It's because we feel part of a particular cultural inheritance.'' That inheritance is neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> nor Slavic, she says, but Western.
Indeed, when Hungarian children study their country's history, they read about the same 18th-century rulers as do children in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, which once belonged to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hapsburg Empire</ENAMEX>. These cultural ties are being reinforced by a new wave of Western consumer goods -- videotape recorders and color television sets bought by Hungarian tourists on now-legal trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX>.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> still needs sweeping structural change before its burgeoning demand for consumer goods can be met, even though it is already the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>'s most liberal state. It still lacks factories to make the consumer goods people want or the hard currency to buy them.
Increased Western trade would help, but so far the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> have been slow to relax trade barriers. They still brand Hungary a ``state-trading nation,'' subject to numerous disadvantages. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarians</ENAMEX> say this helps keep them from selling valuable items -- machines, medical equipment and other goods -- that would let them import consumer and other goods from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>'s Western trade already exceeds its trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East.</ENAMEX> Some 55% of the total is with hard-currency countries, including $2.6 billion of imports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> and $2.5 billion of exports to it.
``For us,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lorincze</ENAMEX>, secretary-general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarian Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX>, ``ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> are a must.
