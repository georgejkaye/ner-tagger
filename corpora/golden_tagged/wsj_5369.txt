It's an old lesson that investors in junk-bond mutual funds are learning the hard way: You can't pocket a fat payout without taking a big risk.
Many small investors are appalled by this year's suddenly weak returns on many of the nation's 90 junk funds, which hold about $40 billion of high-yield, high-risk bonds. So who's to blame for funneling all that money into a disappointment?
Some investors point the finger at brokers, complaining that the risks weren't fully explained. But brokers reply that investors were greedy, allowing their ardor for double-digit yields to obscure Rule One of investing: a higher yield generally means an investment is less safe.
``To buy on pure yield is one of the classic, all-time investment errors, ``said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Walker</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walker Capital Management Corp.</ENAMEX>
The junk-bond funds continue to rake in enormous interest payments. What has eroded their value to fund shareholders is this year's weakness in junk-bond prices, especially the past week's tremors caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>'s brief cash squeeze.
Investors have racked up a measly 5.7% total return, or price changes plus interest payments, for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> junk-bond index in the year to date. And many junk-bond funds have done worse than that.
``This shows the need for people to pick up the bloody prospectus and at least read the paragraph on risks,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn Mcgrath</ENAMEX>, head of investment management at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>.
But brokers, who by far sell the bulk of all junk funds, also are to blame, some financial planners said.
``The guy on the phone who's churning and burning may not understand what he's selling,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker</ENAMEX> said. When that broker meets a naive customer scrounging for steep yields, he said, it spells trouble.
The funds' names and advertising don't help. They typically include the words ``high yield,'' ``high income'' or ``extra income.'' Promotional materials may include little or no mention of high risks. ``They're not called'low credit-quality funds' or'junk funds,''' noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Gould</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huntington Advisers Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pasadena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
Some investors claim they never were told their funds held junk bonds. Consider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Frisch</ENAMEX>, a former cameraman for the ``Late Night With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Letterman</ENAMEX>'' television show. Looking to live off monthly distribution checks, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frisch</ENAMEX> last year put $200,000 of his $310,000 retirement stash into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter High Yield Securities Fund</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frisch</ENAMEX>, who conceded he knows little about the markets, said his former broker, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pia Hieber</ENAMEX>, misled him about the fund's risks. ``She told me it was perfectly safe,'' he contended, and ``never told me it was junk bonds.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hogwash</ENAMEX>, replied Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hieber</ENAMEX>, now a broker for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gruntal Inc.</ENAMEX> She said she clearly pointed out the risks to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frisch</ENAMEX> and even recommended that he buy tax-deferred annuities instead. But ``he had to have the highest payout,'' she said. ``He's probably upset because {the fund's} value has slumped.''
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hieber</ENAMEX> added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> portfolio isn't ``a'junk-junk' fund.... It's got some pretty-good-rated bonds.'' But as for putting in so much of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frisch</ENAMEX>'s retirement money, she said, ``We probably shouldn't have let him do it.''
Dozens of funds that aren't labeled ``high yield'' also hold sizable chunks of junk bonds. These include several of the industry's most respected funds such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity Puritan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strong Income Fund</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicholas Income Fund</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lindner Dividend Fund</ENAMEX>.
Such funds in some cases have been pressured into investing in junk to compete with the yields offered by high-flying junk funds, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lori Lucas</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutual Fund Values</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> publication that tracks mutual funds.
But some managers have sharply pared back junk holdings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Strong</ENAMEX> said, for instance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strong Income Fund</ENAMEX> has about 35% of its portfolio in junk bonds, sharply below the 90% held late last year.
There ``has been a huge tornado swirling over'' the junk market, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strong</ENAMEX> said. And ``there might be some pretty good gems in the trash heap if you sort through it.'' But analyzing junk bonds takes time, and a slower economy doesn't bode well for many junk credits. So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strong</ENAMEX> said he's unlikely to hunt for any gems right now.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity Puritan</ENAMEX>, for its part, now has about 11% of its portfolio in junk bonds, less than half the level held a year ago, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bond Fund</ENAMEX> has trimmed its junk-bond holdings to about 55% of the portfolio from about 75% two months ago. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ole Dial</ENAMEX>, the fund's new manager, said the portfolio was too risky.
The $600 million fund, which is sold through brokers, has had about $1 million a day withdrawn by investors since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dial</ENAMEX> took over two months ago. But he blames the outflow on the fund's previous weak performance record rather than the recent junk-market turmoil. He notes that outflows haven't accelerated in recent days.
So far, withdrawals of money from junk funds have come primarily from a few big funds sold directly to investors, fund executives said. People who buy these no-load funds typically are much more active and sophisticated traders than those who buy through brokers. And many broker-sold funds charge exit fees, discouraging investors from redeeming their shares.
But if the junk market sours further, some investment advisers say the broker-sold funds could see significant outflows too. Investors in many government-securities funds sold through brokers bailed out long after the returns on these funds started to sour in 1987.
``If junk-bond returns stay crummy for a period of time, it will be like the {<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>} 49ers all trying to get through the same door at one time,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Brouwer</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> investment adviser.
