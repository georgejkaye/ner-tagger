<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard H. Jackson</ENAMEX> is more than just the overwhelming favorite to win this city's mayoral election Oct. 3. He is also the new toast of the business breakfast circuit.
In recent weeks, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> has sometimes started his day at the downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Club</ENAMEX>, breaking bread with the likes of architect-developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Portman; T. Marshall Hahn</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Strickland</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suntrust Banks Inc.</ENAMEX>
Why the sudden chumminess? For starters, on Aug. 8, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>'s only serious opponent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lomax</ENAMEX>, dropped out of the race, leaving seven other candidates -- including civil rights war horse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosea L. Williams</ENAMEX> -- who aren't expected to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> campaign much trouble. That left Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lomax</ENAMEX>'s many business supporters with the choice of watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> bandwagon pass by, or stepping -- if not jumping -- aboard.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, is attempting to avoid repeating mistakes he made between 1974 and 1982. Those years marked his first tenure as mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> -- the city's first black mayor -- as well as a time of bitter relations between City Hall and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s predominantly white business community.
``The big problem was that I lost personal contact with the private-sector leadership,'' says the 51-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Democrat</ENAMEX>, who readily acknowledges the errors of his first administration. ``In hectic times, the relationships weren't there to survive differences of opinion.''
The hectic times have been numerous in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>'s career. A grandson of one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s first black political figures, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> was an early participant in student civil-rights protests and later worked as a self-described ``poor people's lawyer,'' offering free legal services to the disadvantaged. In 1968, at age 30, he dove into the political arena, running a quixotic race for the U.S. Senate against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia's</ENAMEX> venerable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herman Talmadge</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> lost that contest, but the tall newcomer with the movie-star smile made a strong showing among <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s voters, putting him squarely in line for the mayor's office in 1974. The ensuing race with incumbent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Massell</ENAMEX> featured equal doses of racism and civil-rights activism. Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> received just 15% of the city's white vote, he was the near-unanimous choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s blacks.
Upon entering office in 1974, an imposing and impatient Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> laid out an agenda for black empowerment and affirmative action, a program that quickly put him at odds with a business community that had never dealt with a black mayor. ``To say the relationship was strained is a gross understatement,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Loudermilk</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aaron Rents Inc.</ENAMEX>
Instances of not returning phone calls and shunning invitations to private clubs made <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s blue-blood community boil. The powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> Rotary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX>, which traditionally commands an annual speech by the mayor, was stood up on several occasions, recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loudermilk</ENAMEX>. ``When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> did show up, he lectured them. I think he was too young to understand the importance of the group back then.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> once issued an ultimatum to the city's conservative banking community: ``Open your inner sanctums {to minorities}, or the city will find some place else to put its money.'' Although that eruption came only after 18 months of fruitless talks with local banks, financial executives were still appalled, recalls the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph E. Lowery</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</ENAMEX>.
Clashes over construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartsfield International Airport</ENAMEX> involved everyone from design firms to airlines to contractors. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> held up design work on the $500 million project for six months while pushing local architectural and engineering firms to add minority joint-venture partners, recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Berry</ENAMEX>, former commissioner of aviation.
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> says his priorities will be the same, he maintains he is older, wiser, more diplomatic and more patient. Because whites accept him more, he can be less defensive, he says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> also is quick to note that his time in office was marked by more than just confrontation. He says some 70,000 low-income residents, for instance, found jobs during his tenure. The city's reputation for police brutality was curbed. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartsfield Airport</ENAMEX> was completed ``on time,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, helping to make <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> an international crossroads.
Now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> appears ready to open his doors to business leaders. ``He's made a strenuous effort to reach people in the business community,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Carter Sr.</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carter & Associates</ENAMEX>, a real estate development firm. ``This is a good sign and promising in terms of the future.'' Adds the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowery</ENAMEX>: ``We see a more mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX> now, one that has mellowed.''
Many political observers say the problems that await <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s next mayor may be more serious than the issues Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> first confronted in 1974. The number of drug-related crimes has skyrocketed, and some 30% of the city lives in poverty. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Outgoing</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Young</ENAMEX>, who is currently building his campaign machine for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia governor</ENAMEX>'s race in 1990, has often been criticized for spending more time promoting the city than dealing with these problems.
Says the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mckinley Young</ENAMEX>, pastor of one of the city's largest black churches: ``The disparity between the haves and have-nots is no longer a black-white issue. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maynard</ENAMEX>'s biggest task will be to take <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> beyond the illusion of being a boom town.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> agrees and says he hopes the business community will be an ally -- not an adversary. ``I think the olive branch will have to come from both sides,'' he says. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> has a more intense set of problems that have to be addressed, and there's less money available in the form of federal largess.''
He adds that he no longer has to contend with history. ``I don't have to be the'first ' black mayor this time, so I can concentrate more on getting the job done.
