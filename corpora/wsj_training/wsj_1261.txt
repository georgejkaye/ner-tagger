<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith Corp.</ENAMEX> is launching a new service to offer advertisers package deals combining its book, magazine and videocassette products.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Des Moines</ENAMEX>-based publisher said it created a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Custom Marketing Group</ENAMEX> that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladies Home Journal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Homes and Gardens</ENAMEX>. In addition, the group will create custom-designed media such as cookbooks, newspaper inserts and videos for ad campaigns.
Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith</ENAMEX> sold its first such package for $3 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft Inc.</ENAMEX>, now a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX> The Kraft package included a specially published cookbook, a national free-standing insert in Sunday newspapers, and a Kraft ``advertorial'' section that ran in five Meredith magazines. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kraft</ENAMEX> recently agreed to spend an additional $3 million on similar programs through 1990.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Murphy</ENAMEX>, director of the new marketing unit, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith</ENAMEX> is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories, but he wouldn't disclose their names. Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith</ENAMEX> said leading advertisers in consumer electronics, packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith group</ENAMEX>.
Other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine Group</ENAMEX> earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golf Digest magazine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> recently formed a ``synergy department'' to seek out ways to offer advertisers packages that could combine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s magazines with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> products such as videocassettes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Ducharme</ENAMEX>, director of media services at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey Advertising</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith</ENAMEX> is the leader in providing multimedia packages. ``They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together, but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith</ENAMEX> said one advertiser, which he wouldn't identify, wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines, publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase, give away a videotape on installation pointers, and possibly use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith's Better Homes and Gardens</ENAMEX>' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners.
``Five years ago, magazine publishers would simply bid on an advertiser's big ad schedule for their magazine,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX>. ``But the marketplace changed. Advertisers now say `Help us improve our image and extend our selling season.' They are coming to publishers looking for ideas.
