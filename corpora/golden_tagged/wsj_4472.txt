Construction contracting slipped 3% in August to an annualized rate of $252 billion, continuing the slight moves registered each month since May, forecaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.W. Dodge Group</ENAMEX> said.
Much of the weakness in August was related to contracting for publicly funded works and utilities, off 10% from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>'s level. Housing and nonresidential building, the other major categories of contracting, were little changed.
A measure of new contracting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> Index, fell to 160 in August from the plateau of 165 during the previous three months. The index has averaged 164 for the year's first eight months. It uses a base of 100 in 1982.
``Housing offers the best, and maybe the only chance for the stalled construction industry to avoid a decline this year,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George A. Christie</ENAMEX>, vice president and chief economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcgraw-Hill Inc.</ENAMEX> unit that tracks construction contracting. ``Although August data failed to bring the awaited recovery of home building in response to lower interest rates, improving sales of newly completed homes suggest that a rebound of building isn't far off.''
In total, newly started residential building, at an annualized $118.6 billion in August, was unchanged from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. Construction of multifamily units was down in August, but was offset by a gain in contracting for hotels, while one-family building remained steady.
In August, nonresidential-contracting activity slowed 2% to an annualized $91 billion. The category was dragged by slackened office and factory building, which in turn pulled the commercial-industrial component down 9%. However, contracting for institutions, such as schools and hospitals, gained 8%, offsetting that setback.
As in previous months, governmental budgetary restraint was responsible for reducing new construction of highways, bridges and other infrastructures in August. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonbuilding</ENAMEX> projects, or public works and utilities, fell 10% in the month to $42.4 billion, the lowest annualized level for the past six months. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christie</ENAMEX> said, ``For whatever reason, there was a noticeable absence of the large projects which typically dominate this type of construction.''
The unadjusted total of all newly started construction was $175.3 billion after the year's first eight months, compared with $176.9 billion last year, a 1% decrease. With a 3% gain, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North-Central</ENAMEX> region was the only part of the country to show an increase for the year to date. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> were even with a year earlier and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> was off 4%.
