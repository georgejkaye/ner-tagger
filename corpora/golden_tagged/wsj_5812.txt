Secretary of Defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> has ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to develop plans to strengthen the U.S. military presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean Sea</ENAMEX> and along the nation's southern border to curb cocaine smuggling.
Noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> have given his department the lead role in interdicting illegal drug shipments, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> told his top commanders to develop plans by Oct. 15 to carry out the new missions.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> also asked the military to accelerate training and other assistance to military and police forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> said he hoped the moves would ``immediately complicate the challenge of getting illegal drugs into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> -- increasing the cost and the risk of drug smuggling.''
At a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> briefing, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> said the plans will be carried out under President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s guideline that no U.S. troops will accompany Latin American forces on military operations. U.S. troops, he said, will be restricted to training and technical aid, such as improving communications.
While there have been reports that some U.S. military officials were reluctant to take on the anti-drug mission, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> said, ``I haven't found that to be the case.''
The cost of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> effort, he said, won't be determined until the plans are analyzed and approved.
