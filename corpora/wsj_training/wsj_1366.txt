It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, let alone within the same party.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> trekked over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> side of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gonzalez</ENAMEX>. It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX>, who is investigating the $2.5 billion failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX>.
But instead of thanks, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> was treated with cool formality. ``Every witness receives a formal subpoena,'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> told him.
Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> by their friend and political benefactor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating Jr.</ENAMEX>, principal stockholder of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>'s parent company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz</ENAMEX>.
At the first day of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX>'s hearings last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Seidman</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX>, the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts, said the agency is investigating whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> made illegal political contributions. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> arranged nearly $1 million in donations to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> and his various political causes, and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers. Future witnesses include a former federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX> regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to ``subvert'' the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX>.
Unlike many lawmakers, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper. ``When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions, then that's a no-no in my book,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> lawmaker says. And he has attached himself to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> story tenaciously. ``Unless the questions are answered, I will keep on going.''
Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues, even those of opposing political parties. In the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing and Urban Development Department</ENAMEX> scandal, for example, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Lantos</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Democrat who led the hearings, tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> grants secured by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfonse D'Amato</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Republican.
But Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is a genuine maverick. He comes from the same political line as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright Patman</ENAMEX>, a bank-baiting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> populist who chaired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> until 1974. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open. Early in his political career, as a city councilman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced, denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a ``bat-roost meeting.''
The immediate target of Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX>'s inquiry is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Wall</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Thrift Supervision</ENAMEX>. As the principal regulator of the thrift industry, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> delayed seizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> for more than two years after his staff told him that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> seems primed to lash out at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Patriarca</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> relieved them of responsibility for supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> in 1988. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> last week to discuss their testimony in advance. ``I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness, and by God I'm not going to tolerate it,'' he says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX>, however, is a self-proclaimed ``child of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'' and former staff director of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX>. An inquiry into his handling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> inevitably will drag in Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> and the four others, Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Deconcini</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mccain</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Glenn</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Riegle</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>). They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> had dragged on for two years. ``I'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names {of the senators} will be brought out,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> says.
This is raising eyebrows. ``When I first got a glimpse at the witness list, I couldn't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Waldman</ENAMEX>, director of Congress Watch, a consumer group. ``There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators.''
And a Democratic aide to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> member remarks, ``I too am astounded by it, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position.''
All the  senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> thrift's parent is an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>-chartered corporation with holdings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>.
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> expresses sympathy for Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle</ENAMEX>, his counterpart as chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX>. ``He's wise, he's good and I know he's an honest man,'' the Texan says. But at the same time, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> hasn't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX> during House-Senate negotiations over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S*/NN&L</ENAMEX> bailout legislation during the summer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiators included Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riegle</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX>'s principal sponsor, Republican Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jake Garn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>.
They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX>'s job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln S&L. Most</ENAMEX> importantly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> traded away the Bush administration's controversial plan to finance the bailout, which was partly reinstated later.
At the time, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> said several senators told him that they ``could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garn</ENAMEX>'s insistence on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall.</ENAMEX>'' Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway, under the guise of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> investigation. ``In a way, that's what this is,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> concedes.
Even some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> members could suffer from the fallout. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> raised $20,000 for Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Barnard</ENAMEX>'s 1986 re-election campaign while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Democrat</ENAMEX> was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering. He recently voted ``present'' when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> to testify, then changed his vote to yes.
But the chairman's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> and others. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Leach</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>) says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln S&L</ENAMEX> affair is ``the biggest bank heist in history,'' and adds: ``The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making.''
A witness set to testify on Thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> ``laundered'' campaign contributions illegally. But the witness, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Crawford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s chief state thrift regulator, denies saying that. ``I don't know whether it was done properly or not, because I'm not a lawyer,'' he said in a telephone interview yesterday. But he said he is prepared to testify that executives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions.
The committee also has summoned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wall</ENAMEX>'s predecessor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Gray</ENAMEX>. He has characterized the five senators' roles as ``tantamount to an attempt to subvert the... regulatory process,'' and he isn't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting.
So the senators must brace themselves. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cranston</ENAMEX>, as he returned to the capital last week from a one-day trip to inspect earthquake damage in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, sighed to an aide: ``Well, back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Keatingland</ENAMEX>.
