<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest Partners</ENAMEX>, a three-year-old venture capital concern that helped turn <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> into a hotbed of biotechnology startups, is calling it quits.
The disbanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> is no simple business failure. By most measures, the firm has been quite successful in funding new, growing companies. And when it recently solicited $10 million in new venture capital, the fund was oversubscribed.
Partners <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard E. Greene Jr.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy J. Wollaeger</ENAMEX> are bailing out primarily because they are disillusioned.
They misunderstood that real-world venture capitalists spend more time raising money than building new companies these days. And they were turned off by the hardball financing tactics of bigger venture capital firms. Thus, the breakup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> sheds some light on the current venture-capital scene.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> started five companies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> area and helped start a sixth in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Menlo Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, since the partnership was formed in October 1986. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> had been chairman and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wollaeger</ENAMEX> senior vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybritech Inc.</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> genetic-engineering concern was acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli Lilly & Co.</ENAMEX>, the pharmaceutical giant, in March 1986.
With hindsight, the partners, both 46 years old, now say they were ``naive'' to think they were venture capitalists in the conventional sense. They enjoy working with people to build companies and discovered they dislike reviewing business plans and romancing investors with dog-and-pony shows. Venture capitalism has been glamorized as the business of creating new companies, while the real work is largely fund raising, the partners say.
The depressed market for new public offerings has heightened some of the field's ``parasitic'' tendencies, noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Channing</ENAMEX>, general partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.W. Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> venture capital firm. Without a brisk market in initial public offerings, company founders and small backers are more likely to be forced to give up big chunks of their ownership stakes in exchange for money to stay in business.
Such conditions help to create adversarial relationships between deep-pocketed venture capital funds and small seed-capital firms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Biovest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX>, without funds to participate in second-round or third-round financings of the tiny companies it nurtured, found itself allied with management against richer venture capitalists on the companies' boards.
``There's a terrible conflict of interest'' among investors when a scarcity of new capital gives the wealthiest partners power to dictate financing terms, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> said. Unless founders and early investors can ``pay to play,'' -- come up with money to protect positions -- their equity can be squeezed. This is especially unfair to scientists and founders whose ``intellectual property'' is the company's main asset.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> got a bitter taste of these ``cram financing'' tactics several times earlier this year. The partnership lost a third of its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vical Inc.</ENAMEX>, a drug-delivery technology concern. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wollaeger</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> had to dig into their own pockets for money to maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX>'s stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyxis Corp.</ENAMEX>, a medication-dispensing systems developer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pyxis</ENAMEX> employees saw their collective stake cut by 50% as the price for raising $1.5 million.
Certain investors ``held a gun to our head until our funds ran out and then said,'OK'OK, here's the price,''' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Taylor</ENAMEX>, Pyxis chief executive. He declined to identify the venture firms involved.
``The big problem is that I thought all venture capitalists were like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Perkins</ENAMEX>, the guy I understudied with at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybritech</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkins</ENAMEX> is the retired co-founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleiner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caufield & Byers</ENAMEX>, a prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> venture-capital firm and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hybritech</ENAMEX> investor.
But if Kleiner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkins</ENAMEX> -- like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perkins</ENAMEX> himself -- once got intimately involved in the management of companies, today it more closely resembles other big venture-capital companies. To Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX>, many of the venture capitalists who now sit on company boards with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wollaeger</ENAMEX> are ``pencil pushers'' with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ph</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.s</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M.b.a.s</ENAMEX> from top schools who lack operating experience in business. They are more likely to grill management on technical matters than focus on recruiting key people and forging strategic partnerships with large drug companies, the two men said.
``If they've only served on boards and never had to negotiate with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson & Johnson</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandoz</ENAMEX>, they have outrageous ideas about what to expect, and can't really understand what management is wrestling with,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> says.
The partners considered raising $30 million in ``dry powder,'' financial ammunition that could be used to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX>'s investments from predatory venture capitalists, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wollaeger</ENAMEX> said. ``But we decided we didn't want to become another run-of-the-mill venture capital fund.'' Biovest specialized in working with companies at an embryonic stage, contributing seed capital and guidance before seeking conventional venture-capital financing. After abandoning the notion of transforming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> into a larger operation, the partners solicited an additional $10 million in seed capital. They say the new fund was oversubscribed before they decided to throw in the towel.
The pressures of the business were great enough to cause serious personal strains among the partners. ``Sure, some strains are normal any time you're trying to do something difficult,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wollaeger</ENAMEX> said. The ``marriage broke down as we began to focus our energies on different companies,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> said.
The two partners have already taken new positions -- at small medical-products companies. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> began working full time this month as president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amylin Corp.</ENAMEX>, a tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> biotech concern developing diabetes treatments. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wollaeger</ENAMEX> was recently named president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Laboratories Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>-based maker of medical products.
While it won't be making any new investments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> will continue to operate until 1996, when its assets will be liquidated. For now, stock certificates and records will be kept at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX>'s small office in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> suburb. ``I may use {the office} as a retreat to get away,'' but won't be coming in regularly, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> said.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX> brought real hands-on operating experience and guidance to their young companies. It's sad to see them go because it leaves a void in our marketplace,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Dittamore</ENAMEX>, a managing partner in accounting and consulting firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst & Young</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> office.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> started five of the 20 biotechnology firms in the area in the past three years. Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amylin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vical</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pyxis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> provided initial funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytel Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biosite Diagnostics Inc.</ENAMEX> It also helped start <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neurex Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biovest</ENAMEX> raised a total of $32 million for the companies.
