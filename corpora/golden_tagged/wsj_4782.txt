The country's newest daily newspaper rolled off the presses here yesterday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingersoll Publications Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Sun</ENAMEX>, a tabloid, made its first front page story itself.
The headline on page one read ``Sunrise,'' with the photograph of a sunrise through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> Arch and stories inside on the launch of the newspaper. Publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Tallarico</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s first print run was 200,000 copies. The newspaper starts with 55,000 home subscriptions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> vending boxes in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> were empty by midmorning, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tallarico</ENAMEX> said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> is expected to settle down to a daily circulation of about 100,000. The first issue was 128 pages, of which about 70 were ad pages.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> is attempting to be the first new daily newspaper to successfully publish -- without the help of subsidies -- in a major metropolitan market since World War II. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> breaks the monopoly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulitzer Publishing Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> Post-Dispatch.
