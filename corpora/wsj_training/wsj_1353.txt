In a foreign-policy address before the Soviet legislature, the foreign minister conceded that the radar station in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Krasnoyarsk</ENAMEX> breached the superpower Anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ballistic</ENAMEX> Missile treaty and said it would be dismantled. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> said it took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s government four years to determine that the station's location in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siberia</ENAMEX> violated the accord, as Western arms-control officials have long contended.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iran</ENAMEX>'s President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafsanjani</ENAMEX> offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, but said the assistance was contingent on U.S. aid in resolving the cases of three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iranians</ENAMEX> kidnapped in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> rejected the bid, saying the hostages weren't linked to other issues.
