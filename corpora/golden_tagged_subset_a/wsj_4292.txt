<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX>, elaborating on its latest restructuring proposal, reshuffled some existing business units and created a few new ones.
The photographic, chemical and pharmaceutical concern didn't, however, specify which businesses it planned to shed to reduce costs.
Last month, after its second-quarter profit fell 85%, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> said it would cut its work force by 4,500 and sell or consolidate about 20 ailing businesses with revenue totaling $1.25 billion. But its latest announcement didn't indicate exactly how those cost savings would be achieved.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">company</ENAMEX> said it will split its information systems group, which posted a 93% drop in second-quarter profit, into two separate groups. One, an imaging information systems group, will concentrate on software, sensors and scanners; the other, the commercial systems group, will manufacture printing and publishing products.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s three other major divisions, however -- imaging, chemicals and health -- will remain essentially intact, although some units will be reorganized. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s health business will consist of four separate units -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Drug</ENAMEX>, health sciences, clinical products and household products. Until now, household products, which manufactures Lysol disinfectant, reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Drug</ENAMEX>, while health sciences and clinical products were grouped separately.
Analysts said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> may be positioning certain businesses, like household products, for the auction block. ``Household products just doesn't fit with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s other businesses,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Lee Landry</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> spokesman, however, said its repositioning of certain businesses doesn't mean the company plans to shed them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> observers were unimpressed by the outlined changes. ``These (organization) changes aren't going to alter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s fundamental difficulties,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Henderson</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc.</ENAMEX> ``This isn't the major restructuring Wall Street is looking for.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s announcement came after the close of trading. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, its shares closed at $46.75, unchanged.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> announced several management changes as part of its business realignment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence J. Matteson</ENAMEX>, currently a company group vice president and general manager, commercial and information systems, was named general manager of the new imaging information systems group. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank P. Strong</ENAMEX>, general manager of diversified technologies\ science, was named general manager of the newly formed commercial systems group.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo J. Thomas</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Drug</ENAMEX> unit, was named general manager of the health division. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John P. White</ENAMEX>, a general manager in software, was named general manager and vice president of the newly formed integration and systems product division, a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s imaging business.
