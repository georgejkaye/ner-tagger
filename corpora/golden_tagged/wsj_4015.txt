<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Mellanby</ENAMEX>'s article, ``With <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Safeguards</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DDT</ENAMEX> Should Still Be Used'' (editorial page, Sept. 12), was very important. Few Americans realize DDT may have contributed more to human happiness than any other synthetic chemical because of its ability to eradicate malaria.
During the 1930s I was a geologist for an oil company mapping the middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magdalena Valley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>. The area was sparsely inhabited because malaria was endemic; most of the Colombians lived in the high mountains where there were no mosquitoes. The people in the valley were lethargic and debilitated by malaria. You seldom die of malaria, but you hurt all over from head to foot with shaking chills and high fever.
No vaccine has been possible because the origin is not a bacterium but a protozoan. There are, however, several specifics like quinine. I had malaria repeatedly and finally nearly died, so the medical department shipped me home. I used to think about the hundreds of millions of people who were suffering from malaria, and the huge areas of wet tropics all around the world that were virtually uninhabitable.
Then DDT was made available. Groups of boys would enter all the houses in a village and spray DDT on the walls. After biting someone, a mosquito would fly to the nearest wall to digest the blood. There it would pick up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDT</ENAMEX> and die before it could develop the plasmodium in its own body and infect another person. The chain was broken, and malaria was almost completely eradicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>. Perhaps one bad result is that people are now moving to the tropical rain forests that were previously almost uninhabitable.
It is true that resistant strains have been developed, and that malaria still persists in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and other places. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDT</ENAMEX> sprayed by hand on the walls of houses does no harm to the environment, and its contribution to human health and happiness is incalculable.
