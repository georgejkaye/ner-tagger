For days, U.S. newspapers had been predicting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> But here in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> had declined to comment or to make executives available for interviews.
Then, last Wednesday night, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> confirmed the $3.4 billion deal. But the consumer-electronics concern did so in a fashion that could hardly have been more ironic. Here was <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s most internationalized company making the largest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company to date -- and announcing it in a news conference for Japanese journalists only.
For almost an hour, Norio <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s president, described <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s hopes for getting ``synergy'' out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX>, a previous Sony U.S. acquisition.
But only the briefest reference to all this appeared in the one-page news release <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> later faxed to foreign reporters. Two foreigners heard about the news conference by coincidence (one from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> competitor) and managed to crash it despite being told that foreigners weren't welcome. But on most of the foreign media, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohga</ENAMEX>'s words were lost.
At the time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> held the news conference and faxed the news release, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> were closed. While the company's disclosure method may not have violated stock-exchange or government rules, it did underscore a problem that could grow more serious as Japanese companies make more and more acquisitions abroad: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s ``kisha club'' system and how it limits foreign access to news.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kisha</ENAMEX> is the Japanese word for reporter, but a kisha club is more like a news cartel than a reporters' club. It's a device for limiting access to news briefings to representatives of the major Japanese daily newspapers, wire services and the like. Those who aren't members of the kisha club covering a particular government agency or industry -- most Japanese magazine reporters, for example -- can't attend the briefings.
The kisha-club system shares points in common with some of the ``structural barriers'' to imported goods and services about which foreign governments have been complaining to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. It wasn't initially aimed at keeping out foreigners, although it has that effect. It reflects a strong Japanese preference for order and harmony over unbridled competition. And the situation is, from a foreign viewpoint, improving.
Many Japanese kisha clubs, led by the one covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX>, are now letting foreign reporters sit in on briefings, and some are even allowing foreigners to ask questions at them.
But other briefings with government officials are still closed. During last year's Recruit scandal, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> prosecutor's office not only barred foreign reporters from briefings but even refused to confirm information it had given to its kisha club. And some of the kisha clubs covering private industries adamantly continue to reject foreigners.
As a result, when Japanese companies do deals with foreign companies, the Japanese press frequently has access to information from both sides, while the foreign press doesn't. Take, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX>'s recent agreement to purchase 4.9% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> and 60% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers' CIT Group Inc.</ENAMEX> for $1.4 billion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> announced the deal at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> news conference that was open to all reporters. A few hours later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai Ichi Kangyo</ENAMEX> held its own news conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> -- for Japanese reporters only.
``Progress has been made in general, but it's two steps forward and one step back, constantly,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Tharp</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Correspondents Club</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> bureau chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. News & World Report</ENAMEX>.
On the surface, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> ought to have been the least likely Japanese company to play ball with the exclusionary kisha-club system. While ``internationalization'' is just a buzzword for many Japanese companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> built its first plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> in the early 1970s, long before most other Japanese companies began manufacturing abroad. Unlike many other Japanese companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> has run its overseas operations with foreign managers, and earlier this year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> became the first Japanese company to put foreigners on its board of directors.
Some Japanese companies privately fear that if they push their  kisha clubs too hard to open up, the reporters could retaliate with negative articles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> doesn't admit to such fears, but it clearly is sensitive to its treatment by the Japanese press. Founded after World War II, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is a relative newcomer to the Japanese corporate world, and it's still regarded as something of an outsider. It doesn't have the extensive retail-distribution network in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> that its more-entrenched consumer-electronics competitors have, nor does it have domestically the premium-brand image that it has overseas.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> spokesman Haruyuki <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machida</ENAMEX> does admit to having been under a certain amount of pressure from the Japanese press before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ohga</ENAMEX>'s news conference. The pressure was especially intense, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machida</ENAMEX> says, because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> newspapers, including this one, had been so full of ``leaks and reports {from sources in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>} that were so detailed, while I had to stick to a very strict guideline of'no  comment''' in dealing with the press in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machida</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was also squeezed by such considerations as the need to organize the briefing hastily and the lack of a room large enough to handle a big crowd of reporters. He admits, however, that these sound like ``excuses.''
``What I did was not the best choice, and I feel very sorry for that,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Machida</ENAMEX>, ``but I hope you understand and appreciate that this was a very difficult issue.''

Sales of new cars in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> rose a hearty 5% in August from a year earlier.
The increase adds to the roller-coaster picture of European auto sales seen since the beginning of the second quarter. Industry and government statistics from 12 countries that normally account for about 94% of noncommunist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s passenger car sales showed new car registrations rose to 1,149,341 in August, up 5% on the year and 22% from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
The figures were boosted by record August sales in the U.K. of 500,112. That total reflects continuing strength in British consumer demand and aggressive incentive programs by many auto makers.
While the latest month bettered most analysts' expectations, ``the general opinion appears to be that the market will now cool off'' over the next year and a half before entering another period of steady growth, said one industry observer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edzard Reuter</ENAMEX>, the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz AG</ENAMEX>, said there are many potential buyers for parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b. H.</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBB</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz</ENAMEX>, a West German aerospace concern, plans to take over state-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MBB</ENAMEX>, but the government is making both companies first spin off certain defense technology activities. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuter</ENAMEX> also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Airbus Industrie</ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospatiale SA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MBB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace PLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Construcciones Aeronauticas SA</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, should become fully privatized. ``We will work decisively to see that it happens,'' he said. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX> is already a private company, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBB</ENAMEX> will soon be as well, the French and Spanish companies are state-owned.
The British government postponed the sale of the state-owned electricity industry by up to six months; the $32 billion sale had been set to begin next January. The delay was attacked by the opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Party</ENAMEX> and widely viewed as a setback to the government, whose ambitious plans to sell electricity and water suppliers to private investors have sparked sharp public criticism.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Lapointe</ENAMEX>, secretary-general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>-sponsored Convention on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Trade</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Endangered Species</ENAMEX>, said nations that manage elephant herds well should be allowed to continue selling ivory for financial reasons. But he was immediately challenged. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Roch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wide Fund</ENAMEX> for Nature said a total ban was the only answer. ``If people understand they can not buy any ivory object, there will be a real decrease in ivory demand,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> ruled out higher grain imports or a return to Maoist collectives to feed its 1.1 billion people, saying more efficient family farms were the answer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People's Daily</ENAMEX> rejected the view that small-scale farming methods had reached the limit of their potential and that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> would have to import grain for a long time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latest</ENAMEX> official estimates put the 1989 grain harvest at above last year's 394 million tons, but it may not reach the target of 410 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>'s government expenditure is running far ahead of budget, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> said. From April to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the first four months of the current fiscal year, government expenditure rose 30.7% over the same period last year -- well above the budgeted increase of 15% for the fiscal year as a whole, the bank said. But it said that government revenue had also run ahead of budget in the four months, mainly because of increases in the fuel levy, hikes in the surcharge on imports introduced last year and income from a higher general sales tax.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bertelsmann AG</ENAMEX> said its consolidation phase was about to end -- ahead of schedule.
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Woessner</ENAMEX> said the West German publishing giant's past fiscal year, which ended June 30, ``was much better than projected.'' He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bertelsmann</ENAMEX>'s group net income rose 16% to 420 million West German marks ($223.3 million) in fiscal 1989 from 362 million marks in the previous year.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woessner</ENAMEX> said such ``excellent'' results would help complete the period of consolidation by the end of next fiscal year instead of in three years, as had been planned. This phase started in fiscal 1987 with the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doubleday Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA/Ariola Records</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Despite the near-completion of the consolidation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bertelsmann</ENAMEX> will abstain from making any ``spectacular'' acquisitions in the near future, its chairman said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> dropped an atomic bomb near Soviet army units in 1954 to test the effects of the blast, said the armed forces daily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Star.</ENAMEX> The newspaper said the bomb was dropped in the south <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Urals</ENAMEX>, but it didn't report any casualties or address how the soldiers may have been affected.... An Israeli farm settlement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> has found a way to grow bug-free lettuce in hothouses. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> said the discovery was a boon for Orthodox Jews who previously soaked lettuce in vinegar and washed it repeatedly to remove all insects, proscribed by dietary laws.
