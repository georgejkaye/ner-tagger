<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C. Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>, said it paid down $25.2 million of debt and negotiated a new credit line.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer I. Browne</ENAMEX>, executive vice president and general counsel, said the troubled home builder used ``available liquidity'' to pay off several lenders from the original credit line, including some failed institutions that had been taken over by federal regulators.
The payment reduced the debt outstanding on the credit line to $5.8 million, which was then included in the new, $20 million credit line negotiated by a newly formed subsidiary with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Interstate Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>. The credit line can be increased to $35 million if additional institutions join the lending group, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Browne</ENAMEX> said the company already has drawn most of the $14.2 million of credit currently available.
The new credit facility is secured by ``a substantial portion'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> home building and land development inventories, the company said.
Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C.</ENAMEX> has been stung by an investigation into its accounting practices by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> and a string of quarterly losses that had some analysts speculating about a possible default. The company recently settled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> dispute by adding an explanatory footnote to its 1988 results while neither admitting nor denying guilt.
