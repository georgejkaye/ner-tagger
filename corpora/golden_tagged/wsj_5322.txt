<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHARIOT GROUP Inc.</ENAMEX> directors omitted the quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter, to devote resources to ``future acquisition activity.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> home-building products and metal fabricating company last paid an eight-cent dividend on July 25. In January, it declared a one-time dividend of 50 cents a share after selling its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandusky Plastics Inc.</ENAMEX> subsidiary, and boosted the quarterly payout to eight cents a share from six cents. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Saba</ENAMEX>, treasurer, said the omission for the latest quarter would save about $200,000. For future quarters, he said, the board will ``take it one step at a time. We want to send a message that we're on top of our costs and expenses and looking for other opportunities.'' The company is 75%-owned by its chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gray</ENAMEX>.
