<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> turned up the heat in the bidding war for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania Corp.</ENAMEX> by offering to acquire this bank-holding company for stock valued at $18.50 a share, or $721.5 million.
The battle for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> is a complex one. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> already has an offer on the table from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Reading</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian Bancorp Inc.</ENAMEX> for stock valued at $18 a share, or $704 million.
Also, in 1986, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> had agreed to be acquired by Marine <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Midland</ENAMEX> agreed to step aside after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> offered to pay it $30 million to acquire its 24.9% voting stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, plus another $100 million for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> preferred stock it holds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> didn't emerge as a suitor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX>, an aggressive, out-of-town competitor, came forward with an offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX>, a stalwart in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> banking community, had to contend previously with out-of-town competition when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNC Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> took over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provident National Bank</ENAMEX> and when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mellon Corp.</ENAMEX>, also of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girard Bank</ENAMEX>.
Under the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> shareholders would receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> stock valued at $18.50. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> offer expires at noon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EDT</ENAMEX> today.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> said it would like to top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX>'s bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, but it failed to meet a deadline of 5 p.m. Saturday for submitting a higher offer. It couldn't be learned which bank insisted on the tight deadline.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> said it learned of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> offer after the market closed Friday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> disclosed details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> bid over the weekend. A spokesperson for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> said it still planned to submit a higher bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> said it hadn't intended to disclose its bid until today.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> spokesman said ``we have made a complete offer'' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>. He declined to comment on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> was negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Midland.</ENAMEX>
Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached to comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> bid.
