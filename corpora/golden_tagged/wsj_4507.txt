Securities firms that underwrite stock offerings usually find something kind to say about their corporate clients, and this is the case with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food & Drug Centers</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith's</ENAMEX>, a successful and fast-growing supermarket chain based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>, went public in June at 19. The shares have since risen to 24 1/2, a level at which Rotan <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosle</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith's</ENAMEX> shares are overvalued by 50% -- and well worth avoiding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, has given the stock a plug. Anything less would have been impolitic. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> was the underwriter in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s initial public stock offering.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Giblen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rotan</ENAMEX>'s supermarket analyst, says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s stock price, about 21 times bullish estimates for 1989 earnings, is trading at a premium to the industry's best (and proven) chains and that its multiple assumes a level of earnings growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith's</ENAMEX> has yet to sustain.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giblen</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith's</ENAMEX> is about to run into a nasty surprise that will put a damper on its earnings. The company is entering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, its biggest market, on Nov. 1. It will go head to head with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albertson's</ENAMEX>, a highly regarded chain that is moving in on the same date. Within a year or so, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s plans on having eight big stores there and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albertson</ENAMEX>'s plans on opening nine or 10.
When the chains were making their plans, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> was one of the fastest growing cities in the country. Its population surge, however, has slowed. And according to a survey by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giblen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> has more supermarket square footage per person than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> metropolis. He predicts ``a long, bloody price war.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giblen</ENAMEX> says the four established chains in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> are more modern and tougher than the stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s other markets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Barr</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> food broker, says ``The area is over-stored now.'' With the new entrants, he fears, ``it's going to be a bloodbath.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giblen</ENAMEX> is the first to concede that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith's</ENAMEX>, which operates 94 stores in eight Western states, is well run and a nice place to shop. Its large, modern stores combining groceries and drugs are full of wide aisles and beaming employees, who seemingly make it their goal for customers to breeze through checkout lines.
Sales have jumped 21.8% a year since 1984, thanks to newer and bigger stores and higher sales per square foot. The company strives to couple an upbeat ambiance with low prices. (Its slogan: ``When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s comes to town, prices go down'').
While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s earnings have risen at a compounded  rate of 12%, they haven't climbed as quickly or as steadily as its sales. Net profit margins have slipped to 1.4% from 1.8% in 1984. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s return on equity, in the low teens, is well behind the industry leaders'.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albertson</ENAMEX>'s has higher net margins (2.4%), higher return on equity (22%) and higher earnings growth -- well above 20% in recent years -- than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albertson</ENAMEX>'s is trading at a lower multiple (18) of estimated earnings.
Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Mandel</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX>, concedes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s stock doesn't appear a bargain. But it will prove to have been so, he says, after its earnings explode at 25% per annum.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandel</ENAMEX> prophesies net of $1.15 a share this year and $1.35 in 1990 and ``very significant'' gains thereafter. His reason, simply, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s ``is superb at the supermarket business.'' (It should be noted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandel</ENAMEX> has in the past declined to recommend other stocks underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman.</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bolinder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s chief financial officer, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s profit margins suffered from the cost of remodeling and opening stores. But such costs, relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s growing size, will shrink. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s aims to keep on adding about 14 new stores a year, but it will benefit from synergies and economies of scale. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolinder</ENAMEX> thus predicts that sales, margins and returns on equity will increase.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s debt is low enough, analysts note, to cushion a bit of bleeding in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolinder</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s can absorb two years of losses there and still keep pace with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX>'s earnings estimates. He concedes that population growth has slowed, but adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s stores are planned for well-populated areas and won't depend on growth. Asked whether the city is overstored, he says ``they said that about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucson.</ENAMEX>'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s entered that city in 1987 and turned profitable there in less than a year. ``There are plenty of stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, but they are the wrong kind of stores,'' he says. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolinder</ENAMEX>, a former vice chairman at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albertson's</ENAMEX>, says ``the market is ripe'' and can accommodate both chains. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Reuling</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of store development at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albertson</ENAMEX>'s, is a bit less generous. He says ``we intend there to be room for us.''
