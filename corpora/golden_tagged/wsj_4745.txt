<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Samuel Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> is proposing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX> split in two to bolster the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> defense equipment maker's finances in light of a major contract scandal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sources</ENAMEX> said the proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill Samuel</ENAMEX>, an investment bank, would split Ferranti by giving shareholders separate shares in the part of the company involved in the scandal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal & Control</ENAMEX>, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, and in the remaining businesses.
``There would be one good, viable business and one with a question mark,'' a source familiar with the plan said.
A third party could be brought in as a minority shareholder to further support Ferranti after the break up, the sources said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill Samuel</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSB Group PLC</ENAMEX>, entered talks Monday with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s financial advisers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baring Bros.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ltd.</ENAMEX>, the sources said. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Samuel</ENAMEX> plan is only one of several being considered.
A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Murray Johnstone Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glasgow</ENAMEX> fund management firm working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Samuel</ENAMEX> on the plan, described the talks as ``preliminary.''
The break-up option is being touted as a way for Ferranti to maintain its independence better in the face of a possibly substantial asset write-off on the resolution of the contract scandal.
Ferranti so far hasn't commented on the various proposals. The company, whose shares were suspended from trading Sept. 11, has said it may have been defrauded on contracts involving Middle Eastern customers. Analysts value the contracts at 150 million to 200 million pounds ($235.7 million to $314.3 million). If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> were to write off payments of that size, it could halve its net asset value.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Samuel</ENAMEX> has already approached at least one British company, Thorn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI PLC</ENAMEX>, about buying a stake in the more-favored half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>.
