Top executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> headquarters routinely referred clients wishing to do business with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> to the bank's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch because of the branch's expertise in handling Iraqi credits, sources at the Italian state-owned bank said.
They added that the central bank of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> also had a cash collateral deposit of several tens of millions of dollars with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>. It is possible that this cash came from loans extended by the bank's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch, the sources said.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> sources yesterday insisted that the head office was aware of only a small portion of the credits to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> made by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>. These totaled only in the tens of millions of dollars, and involved approved transactions by well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and Italian companies, the sources said. They denied that any sales of weapons were involved.
The disclosures come amid growing speculation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> that someone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s biggest bank, was aware that the bank's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch was lending massive amounts of money to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> and either approved the transactions or at least failed to stop them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> so far has pinned the blame for the unauthorized lending, which totals around $3 billion -- not all of it yet disbursed -- on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch's manager, 40-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Drogoul</ENAMEX>.
In a stormy debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Deputies</ENAMEX> yesterday, opposition members of parliament blasted the government for failing to provide a full account of the affair, and demanded a parliamentary inquiry. Even members of the ruling five-party coalition were dissatisfied with official explanations offered so far. ``The attempts to write off the affair by blaming a single functionary have failed,'' declared Gerolamo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pellicano</ENAMEX>, a deputy from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Party</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, seven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> officers and two other employees of the branch were suspended yesterday, pending the findings of audits of the branch, one of the suspended employees said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> officials from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> have taken over operations at the branch. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drogoul</ENAMEX> was suspended in August.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guido Carli</ENAMEX> reiterated in a meeting before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Deputies</ENAMEX> that the techniques used to hide the unauthorized operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> ``left traces in the official accounts of the bank.''
So far, he said, ``no specific references to arms traffic have emerged'' in BNL <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s documents. ``At the moment, it's not possible to understand whether the irregular dealings between BNL <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> were part of a wider scheme,'' he said.
Despite persistent reports that a list of companies suspected of illegal arms trading has been handed over to investigators, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carli</ENAMEX> said that he was unable to name the companies that had received financing for exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> from BNL <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> because the branch's information is too ``fragmentary.''
Investigations are under way by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Italy</ENAMEX> inspectors, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> public prosecutor and a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venice</ENAMEX> magistrate who is studying arms traffic to Iran allegedly financed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carli</ENAMEX> promised to keep Parliament informed on their progress.
