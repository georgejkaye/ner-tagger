At a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s financial center, the opening of a three-man office on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> side street shouldn't attract much attention.
Unless, of course, it happens to be run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rothschilds</ENAMEX>.
After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire, the return of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX> group to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> was greeted by the glare of television lights, curious reporters and a mayoral reception in Town Hall.
Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here, the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s largest economy ahead of the integration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> markets after 1992. Yet the Rothschilds don't deny an emotional element to the decision.
In 1796, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayer Amschel Rothschild</ENAMEX> founded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild</ENAMEX> & Sons and later sent his four sons to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Naples</ENAMEX> to begin the bank's expansion during the early 19th century. The original bank in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> closed in 1901 after the death of Wilhelm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl von Rothschild</ENAMEX>, and the family's banking activities focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baron Elie de Rothschild</ENAMEX>, the family's elder spokesman, explains that by the end of the 19th century, Berlin had replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s financial center. Yet the chief reason for the closure, he says, was rooted in a family tradition that wouldn't allow a bank to bear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX> name without a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX> in its management. ``At the time we had only daughters,'' explains the 72-year-old patriarch, ``so we had to close the bank.''
Much of the family's mystique remained. Although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during World War II, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschilds</ENAMEX>' place in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>'s history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX> name.
The family's long absence is understandable. The family was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Allied</ENAMEX> countries during both World War I and the long period of economic strife of [the 1920s]*. During the Third Reich, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> were a target of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nazi</ENAMEX> propaganda against Jewish financiers. The persecution pursued the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as the Nazis grabbed countries, confiscating the family's property in the process.
American journalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William L. Shirer</ENAMEX>, in his book ``The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' wrote of how in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> he had witnessed ``squads of {Nazi} SS men carting off silver, tapestries, paintings and other loot from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX> palace.''
In the immediate postwar years, the Rothschilds concentrated on rebuilding their other European operations, delaying their return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>.
``For a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX> family, the return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> is a very meaningful event, although it might not mean as much to German banking as it means to us,'' says Baron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David de Rothschild</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elie</ENAMEX>'s younger cousin and a partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild & Cie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
Indeed, the competition isn't greatly concerned. ``It would be surprising if they didn't come to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> in time for 1992, and they bring an interesting tradition. But the market really isn't going to be stood on its head,'' said a banker at one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>'s Big Three banks.
The return of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> is modest. The new representative office, with one manager and two assistants -- none a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX> family -- will carry out no banking operations of its own. Instead, it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family's mainstay banking units: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild & Cie.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild Bank AG</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX>.
The constraints don't bother the office's 54-year-old manager, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Stromeyer</ENAMEX>. He left his job as general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> office because, he says, ``When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> called, I couldn't resist.''
Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild bank</ENAMEX> is linked by family ties and cross-ownership. In March, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N M Rothschild</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX> showed assets of # 4.1 billion ($6.51 billion) and 1.26 billion Swiss francs ($774 million), respectively. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> bank doesn't publish that figure.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as European industry restructures ahead of 1992. Yet the group's limited resources makes it a niche player.
``Obviously, there are quantitative limitations on the assistance we can provide,'' concedes Baron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David de Rothschild</ENAMEX>, ``but we feel we have some cards to play.'' Among them, he says, is the family's traditional ties to old wealth and decision-makers in banking and industry throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and beyond.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschilds</ENAMEX> hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors. As at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX> bank, the minimum investment for individuals will be high: about a million German marks ($538,000), three times what many other West German investment banks require.
``But we do make exceptions,'' says a smiling Baron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elie</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild</ENAMEX>, ``especially if they are very young and have very rich parents.
