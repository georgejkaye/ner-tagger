<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> said they agreed to sell their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovision Associates</ENAMEX> joint venture to U.S. units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer Electronic Corp.</ENAMEX> for $200 million.
The joint venture licenses a portfolio of about 1,400 patents and patent applications relating to optical-disk recording technology.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovision</ENAMEX> in 1979 to make laser-read optical products. But the partners didn't believe the market for the systems was developing as rapidly as they had hoped. After reportedly investing $100 million in the business, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovision</ENAMEX> ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX>, among others.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovision</ENAMEX> now has world-wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks, audio disk players, videodisks and videodisk players. It also licenses optically based data storage and retrieval devices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James N. Fiedler</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovision</ENAMEX> and a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX>, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> hadn't planned to sell the joint venture, which is now profitable, but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovision</ENAMEX> earlier this year. He said it isn't certain whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovision</ENAMEX>'s current management will remain when Pioneer buys the company.
The agreement is contingent on certain government approvals and should be completed later this year.
