The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, in an unprecedented request, is seeking permission to trade 205 Nasdaq and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> stocks.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>, in what it called a ``technicality'' connected with its controversial stock-basket product, asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> for permission to trade the seven Amex and 31 Nasdaq stocks that are part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor's Corp.</ENAMEX>'s 500-stock index, on which the basket will be based. It also wants permission to trade 167 stocks that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> said are ``likely candidates'' for future substitution in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> 500.
In a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> said it will use the privileges to trade the 205 non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> securities ``only for the purpose of trading Exchange Stock Portfolios, and only to the extent required by changes'' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> 500.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, however, isn't so sure of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> has in mind.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Liebler</ENAMEX> said that at first glance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> filing ``raises a lot of questions.'' He said his exchange won't be that concerned if the trading privileges are exclusively geared to accommodating basket trading. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liebler</ENAMEX> questioned the large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amex</ENAMEX> stocks -- more than 100 issues -- that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> wants the flexibility to trade just in case <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> ever includes them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> 500. ``That's something we wouldn't necessarily give our blessing to,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liebler</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Hardiman</ENAMEX> said he isn't concerned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> might use the basket as a means of trying to steal away Nasdaq stocks. Competition between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> has been fierce in recent years for listings of hot stocks.
``They view those 31 stocks as stocks they'd love to have,'' he said. But ``I don't think they're going to use this as a platform to go after some of our stocks.''
For its part, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> insists it's not trying to horn in on other exchanges' prized issues. ``We are proposing to trade a product that involves stocks not listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NYSE</ENAMEX>, and we are taking the necessary steps to trade that product,'' the exchange said in a statement.
This is the first time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> has sought permission to trade a stock that trades on another exchange, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Kramer</ENAMEX>, assistant director for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s division of market regulation.
The exchange considers the stock basket one of its most important new forays in many years. The product, announced in June and awaiting regulatory approval, is designed to give big investors a new way to trade a broad cross section of the market.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> product would enable big institutional investors to buy and sell, in $5 million blocks, all the stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> 500. The product isn't expected to begin trading until late October at the earliest.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> announced its basket product, it considered matching the basket to the 462 stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> 500 that are traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. But big investors argued that the missing 38 stocks would have too great an impact on the trading.
The latest move doesn't mean that investors will be flocking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> to trade such big-name Nasdaq issues as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> said. It added that the stocks will be available only as part of the basket.
What the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> is seeking is ``unlisted trading privileges'' in the 205 stocks. That would allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> to trade the issues in a way similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> exchanges' trading in many stocks.
The matter is the latest in a series of thorny issues raised since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> announced its new product in June. Traders wonder whether this is a one-time foray into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amex</ENAMEX> stocks, or whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> will seek permission to trade a host of baskets and even more trading privileges in unlisted stocks.
