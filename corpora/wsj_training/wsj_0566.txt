In the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> said it will create a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense and Space Group</ENAMEX> to consolidate several divisions.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> officials and representatives of the Machinists union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the month-old strike that has shut the aerospace giant's assembly lines at a time when it has an $80 billion backlog of jetliner orders. The two sides were scheduled to meet with the mediator this morning.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machinists</ENAMEX> already have rejected a package that would provide a 10% pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has said repeatedly it won't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer isn't good enough.
However, the resolve of some of the striking 57,000 machinists might be weakening. About 1,000 strikers signed petitions last week calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machinists</ENAMEX> representatives to schedule new meetings. The two sides hadn't met since Oct. 18.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s commercial business is booming, its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the Reagan presidency. In May, the company consolidated its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospace and Electronics</ENAMEX> groups; the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense and Space Group</ENAMEX> will contain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospace and Electronics</ENAMEX> division and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Systems</ENAMEX>, both based in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> area; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Helicopters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Military Airplanes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wichita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argosystems</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
B. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Pinick</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Aerospace and Electronics</ENAMEX>, will become president of the new group, which will become operational Jan. 2.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> said it also will reorganize all its work in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wichita</ENAMEX> into military and commercial divisions. All of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> said.
Analysts agreed. ``It's a further step to better returns in the hemorrhaging defense business,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Binder</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``They had to do it.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Rubel</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.J. Lawrence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, said the shift reflects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> confidence in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinick</ENAMEX>, described by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubel</ENAMEX> as an expert on doing business with the military. ``His side of the business has been successful in a tough environment,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubel</ENAMEX> said.
