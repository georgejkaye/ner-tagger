<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashua</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.H.</ENAMEX>, expects to report that net income in the third quarter, ended Oct. 1, fell 50% to 60% from $2.1 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stein</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer, attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Masillon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, bakeware facility. Softer-than-expected orders in early September also played a role, he said in an interview.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said he is ``reasonably confident'' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $3.1 million, or 17 cents a share, in 1988. That would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share, assuming that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX>'s third-quarter estimate proves accurate. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, the company had profit of $2.7 million, or 15 cents a share.
Third-quarter revenue is expected to be $40 million to $45 million, up from $38.2 million a year earlier, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Gordon</ENAMEX>, treasurer. The year-earlier periods don't reflect results of the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodstream Corp.</ENAMEX> unit, acquired last January, but include some Canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988.
August through October traditionally is the busiest season for the bakeware business, as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said some retailers -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in September but have been ordering more heavily in October.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodstream</ENAMEX> is ``marginally profitable'' but hasn't performed as well as expected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woodstream</ENAMEX>'s Victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are ``doing very well,'' and its plastic storage-case products ``are poised for growth,'' he said. But the unit's third segment, wildlife traps, is suffering from a ``depressed market,'' and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> is seeking to sell that segment, he said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989, reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco Housewares</ENAMEX> in late 1987. (Prior to acquiring the housewares business, the company was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centronics Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centronics</ENAMEX> had been a maker of computer printers, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market.)
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25% to 30%; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95% from around 70%; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit. By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently, he said.
In addition to those measures, the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers' retail outlets -- a strategy that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said has helped bolster awareness of the company's brands.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco</ENAMEX>'s housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets, as well as bakeware, at factories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. The main issue in the strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> facility was health-care benefits, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said. The strike ended Oct.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stein</ENAMEX> said. He indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ekco</ENAMEX> may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $75 million to $100 million, partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger, and fewer, suppliers.
