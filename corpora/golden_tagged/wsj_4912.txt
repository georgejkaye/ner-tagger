Although I hate to write for free on pages where I once got paid, your daft editorial (``A  Neoliberal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mystery</ENAMEX>,'' Sept. 5) blaming me somehow for the race riots in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bensonhurst</ENAMEX> is too flattering to let pass.
The story thus far. You strongly supported President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s nomination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lucas</ENAMEX> to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s Civil Rights division, on the grounds that he opposes ``reverse discrimination.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Republic</ENAMEX> pointed out that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucas</ENAMEX> obviously got the nomination because he is black, and therefore was a beneficiary of ``reverse discrimination.'' You replied, in an editorial, that there is a difference between ``voluntary'' affirmative action (good) and ``coerced'' reverse discrimination (bad). I wrote a column asking what exactly that difference is. You now accuse me of ``intellectual prancing'' while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bensonhurst</ENAMEX> burns. (And, just to deal with that silly smear, my ``intellectual prancing'' came before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bensonhurst</ENAMEX>; yours came after.)
You state my point with admirable concision: ``reverse discrimination is inherent to the idea of affirmative action.'' You then say that my ``basic proposition... that if it's OK for the President to weigh Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucas</ENAMEX>'s race... it must be OK for the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX> to set aside 30% of contract awards for minorities -- is jejune.'' But that is not my basic proposition. (I specifically said business set-asides are idiotic.) My basic proposition is that The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> is hypocritical when it thunders about its alleged belief in ``colorblindness.'' I would not assert that this hypocrisy is responsible for race riots. But it is not trivial or jejune to accuse a major conservative voice -- especially one that specifically complains of the ``intellectual quality'' of liberal arguments on the subject -- of failing to have its own thoughts in order.
Through all the name-calling you never answer my questions. What difference does it make to a white man who loses out whether reverse discrimination was ``coerced'' by the government or ``voluntary'' on the part of an employer? Since ``voluntary'' discrimination against blacks is unacceptable (I presume), how can ``voluntary'' discrimination against whites be justified under the alleged ``colorblind'' principle? Wasn't/RB <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, for that matter, acting as ``voluntarily'' as President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in creating its 30% set-aside? In short, isn't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX>'s endless self-righteous attitudinizing on this subject unsupportable?
My views on affirmative action are honestly ambivalent. Your views on affirmative action are dishonestly ambivalent. You regularly attempt to stir up moral indignation regarding a principle you don't really accept. On the charming assumption that blacks and whites in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> read both The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Republic</ENAMEX> and The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> while contemplating their next move, whose views are more likely to drive them crazy?
