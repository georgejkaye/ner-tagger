I enthusiastically recommend ``The Nightmare Years'' (which began last night and continues tonight through Wednesday, 8-10 p.m. and repeated 10 p.m.-midnight <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EDT</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Network Television</ENAMEX>) for two reasons. First, it tells one of the original true stories behind today's stock figure of the journalist hero -- that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William L. Shirer</ENAMEX>, the American newspaperman who covered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nazi Germany</ENAMEX> between 1934 and 1940, initially for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal News Service</ENAMEX> and subsequently for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Radio</ENAMEX>.
And second, it tells the story well. Unlike such monster miniseries as ``War and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remembrance</ENAMEX>,'' ``The Nightmare Years'' does not plod steadily through the entire course of World War II, munching tons of advertising dollars and planting a heavy footprint on each and every key event. Instead, it pulls off the delicate task of weaving history into individual experience without slighting either. Of course, the hard work was already done by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirer</ENAMEX>, whose best-selling memoirs form the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Curteis</ENAMEX>'s excellent script.
Perhaps it was inevitable, coming from the Turner network, that this miniseries would employ the latest colorization techniques to insert tinted dramatic scenes -- with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Waterston</ENAMEX> playing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirer</ENAMEX> -- into matching tinted documentary footage of such momentous occasions as the Nazi book burnings, the massive Nuremberg rallies, and the French surrender at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compiegne</ENAMEX>. As we know from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woody Allen</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zelig</ENAMEX>,'' however, the effect of such tricks is unavoidably comic.
Much stronger are the sequences that employ old-fashioned film-making techniques such as good writing, acting, editing, directing and production design. Every character is believably human -- from victims like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Schneider</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Whitman</ENAMEX>), a terrified Jewish art historian trying to save his family from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gestapo</ENAMEX>; to perpetrators like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josef Goebbels</ENAMEX> (Kurtwood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith)</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitler</ENAMEX>'s fanatically loyal minister of propaganda. Instead of the cartoon brutes populating most TV miniseries, the Nazis in this film display frightening intelligence and subtlety while bickering, plotting and rationalizing their evil deeds.
Even more interesting are the bad guys who don't fit the cartoon Nazi mold at all. The British actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Pickup</ENAMEX> is superb as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst ``Putzi'' Hanfsaengl</ENAMEX>, the Nazi foreign press chief whose thwarted bohemian instincts and half-baked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> education keep interfering with his ideological purity. Equally intriguing is the fiercely egotistical Nazi film maker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helga Bauer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frances Barber</ENAMEX>), a fictionalized version of the film maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leni Riefenstahl</ENAMEX>.
Such impressive villains might seem a tough act to follow, but the portrayals of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirer</ENAMEX>, his charming Austrian wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tess (Marthe Keller</ENAMEX>), and the other good guys are equally compelling. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pitted</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goebbels</ENAMEX>'s overweening propaganda machine, a scrappy figure like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Ebbutt</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Times</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter Jeffrey)</ENAMEX> looks heroic even when shouting a drunken warning to an arriving delegation of befuddled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britons</ENAMEX>. The same is true for the rest of the ragged crew of American and British reporters who balk at being spoon-fed lies. This battle of individual wills succeeds in putting the global conflict between freedom and totalitarianism into a neat dramatic nutshell.
Here is my only reservation. One of the characters in ``The Nightmare Years'' seems to offer a brief for the absolute freedom of the press -- not only from totalitarian control, but also from any sort of restraint imposed either by private management or by democratic government. The character is a fictionalized American reporter named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Butler</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Muncke</ENAMEX>), whose craven obedience to his employers (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> empire) connects seamlessly with his mindless admiration of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitler</ENAMEX>. It's significant that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> is the film's only real cartoon villain.
It's possible that absolute freedom of the press matters a lot to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirer</ENAMEX>, who left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> in 1947 after a dispute with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward R. Murrow</ENAMEX> (a friend and colleague) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S. Paley</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirer</ENAMEX>'s criticisms, on his weekly radio program, of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX>'s support of the Cold War. It's also possible that absolute freedom of the press is the credo of another writer who worked on the script -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Woodward</ENAMEX> of Watergate fame. For both of these famous and committed journalists, ``The Nightmare Years'' seems to have been a labor of love. And why shouldn't it be? Those years of living dangerously in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> were a golden age for their profession.
Yet my reservation applies only to the character of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX>. The miniseries shows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirer</ENAMEX> visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> in 1935 and being aghast at the reactions of his old crony, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Roosevelt</ENAMEX>, a wealthy Republican businessman whose hatred for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolsheviks</ENAMEX> (not to mention for his cousin Franklin) blinds him to the frightening tidings about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitler</ENAMEX>. And in a later scene, we see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirer</ENAMEX> chafing at the folly of being required by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> to cover ``human interest'' stories like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> Boys' Choir at the very moment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anschluss</ENAMEX>.
But the film's Shirer never draws a facile parallel between these restraints and the Nazi campaign of mass thought control, or between the systematic hate-mongering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goebbels</ENAMEX> and the caution -- or paralysis -- of news organizations and democratic governments on the brink of war. Actually, given the rocky history of press freedoms during the Cold War, the film could have drawn more parallels than it does. For example, it could have dramatized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murrow</ENAMEX>'s famous remark (made in 1945) that he and his colleagues were going home ``to fight the same kind of things we've been fighting here.''
In this era of polarized opinion about the power and prerogatives of the media, it's remarkable to see ``The Nightmare Years'' keep its priorities so straight. In scenes like the one in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shirer</ENAMEX> cooperates with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Naval Intelligence officer</ENAMEX>'s request to do a little spying on the side, the film illustrates very clearly that the survival of press freedom depends on that of legitimately constituted government. When confronted with a world-class liar like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goebbels</ENAMEX>, or (more recently) with the kind of people who thought nothing of whitewashing the blood from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>, it's heartening to know that a line still exists between journalistic pride and journalistic hubris.
