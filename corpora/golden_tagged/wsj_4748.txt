The days of September, and the baseball magic numbers, are dwindling to a precious few, so it's timely to review some of the differences between the game's winners and losers. Consider, for example, the first inning of Saturday afternoon's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> Giants-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> Astros game in sunny Candlestick Park here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Puhl</ENAMEX> leads off for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astros</ENAMEX> and slaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Reuschel</ENAMEX>'s first pitch into right field for a single. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Biggio</ENAMEX> is credited with a hit on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Reuschel</ENAMEX>'s next pitch when his bunt eludes a convention of three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant infielders.</ENAMEX> That puts runners on first and second with none out, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Bass</ENAMEX> strikes on a 3-2 pitch and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puhl</ENAMEX> is thrown out on a halting attempt to steal third. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Davis</ENAMEX> grounds out, pitcher to first. No runs, two hits.
Now it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>' turn. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brett Butler</ENAMEX> walks off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Scott</ENAMEX> and promptly steals second base. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robby Thompson</ENAMEX> grounds out to second, advancing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> to third. Butler scores on Ken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oberkfell</ENAMEX>'s fly ball to right. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Mitchell</ENAMEX> also flies out. One run, no hits.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Snead</ENAMEX>, the golfer, said, the question isn't how, but how many. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Craig</ENAMEX>, the baseball manager, says, ``What does this team do right? Well, it wins.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX> manages the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>, for whom the magic number in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National League West</ENAMEX> had dwindled to two by the close of business Sunday, so his expertise is to be sought on such matters. His answer was no wisecrack but a simple statement of fact. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>' 91 wins led the league and should provide them a post in the post-season. Moreover, consistency has been their byword. They haven't had a losing month this season. Their longest losing streak has been three games. They haven't been swept in a series, which, I guess, at least ties a record.
Perhaps a bit of sorcery has been involved in those accomplishments, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>' pitching staff has had a medical history to make Blue Cross wince. Three of its five current starters have spent time on the disabled list and a fourth, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Robinson</ENAMEX>, missed a turn Sunday to allow a cortisone shot to soothe an aching knee. No fewer than 15 pitchers have started games for the team, which also might be a record for a division winner.
``We thought we had it bad last year when 12 different guys started,'' notes pitching coach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Sherry</ENAMEX>. ``Turns out we were just getting experience to handle things this season.''
But handle things the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> have, because the pitchers who showed up had posted a 3.29 earned run average through Saturday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX>'s second best, while the hitters have whacked away at a merry clip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> lead the league in runs scored, total bases and slugging percentage, and have the league's best run differential (684 scored vs. 576 allowed).
``We've had the kind of hitting-pitching balance that's pretty rare,'' acknowledges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX>, a former pitcher who in 1986 took over a team that had won 62 and lost 100 the year before and turned in four straight winning seasons, including a division crown in 1987.
Where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> have lacked balance, it has been in the direction of excess. That's in the No. 3 and 4 spots in their batting order, manned, respectively, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Will Clark</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> was batting.337 on Sunday with 22 home runs, 103 runs scored and 109 batted in. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>'s numbers were.292, 47, 100 and 125. One or the other led the league in seven offensive categories.
While not exactly an odd couple, the two are quite different types. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> is a smoothed-muscled sweet swinger, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> a lunger whose 5-foot-10 frame carrying 210 pounds (not counting gold chains) would fit better in a football locker room.
Their approaches to the batsman's art also diverge. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> is a devoted student of game films who ``dissects the pitchers,'' while the more-spontaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> ``stalks'' them, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dusty Baker</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>' hitting coach.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX>, who sat out the weekend with a bruised knee from a home-plate collision Thursday, has built his numbers steadily over a four-year big league career. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> exploded into stardom: His previous best single-season homer total was 22 in 1987. His 47 this year has been topped just twice in the team's long, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SF</ENAMEX> history, both by a fella named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mays</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>' big winner from the mound has been another, uh, big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX>. He's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Reuschel</ENAMEX>, a pear-shaped 40-year-old whose listed weight of 240 pounds flatters him more than a bit. It was his turn to pitch on Saturday after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Astros</ENAMEX> had clipped SF the night before. After collecting two hits on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Reuschel</ENAMEX>'s first two pitches, the visitors got just five more on his next 137 and bowed, 3-1.
For all his heft <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuschel</ENAMEX>'s stock in trade is control, and his performance was vintage. He walked two in nine innings, struck out seven and induced 11 Astros to ground out in collecting his 17th victory. He later stiffed the press, proving again that not all fat guys are jolly. What's he like when he loses?
Where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> finessed their foe Saturday, they bludgeoned'em bludgeoned'em on Sunday afternoon. Mitchell hit home run No. 47 to tie the game at two in the fourth, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX>, a second baseman who must be stronger than he looks, turned a hit-and-run play into a three-run shot in the fifth. The final score was 10-2.
Some 55,000 people showed up in perfect weather (it's always perfect when I go to Candlestick) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX>' regular-season home finale, and had a terrific time. They watched former pitcher Vida Blue get married on the pitcher's mound before the game, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Mccovey</ENAMEX> as his best man. They cheered their portable TV sets as the football 49ers beat the Eagles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. It was ``fan appreciation'' day, and corporate Santas passed out stuff like a cord of firewood, a ride in a helicopter and a gold-plated golf putter.
Manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX> expressed sadness that his team couldn't clinch the division title before the home folks, but he noted that they'll have chances to see their heroes again in the playoffs and, maybe, the World Series. That's what fans really appreciate this time of year.
