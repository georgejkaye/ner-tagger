<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans European Airways</ENAMEX> ordered a dozen 737 jetliners valued at a total of about $450 million. The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Snecma</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>.
Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has a backlog of about $80 billion, but production has been slowed by a strike of 55,000 machinists, which entered its 22nd day today.
Last week, a mediator failed to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers, who have rejected a pay raise offer of 10% over three years.
