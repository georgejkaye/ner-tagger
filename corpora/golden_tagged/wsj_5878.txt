<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atomic Energy Control Board</ENAMEX> deferred a decision on the proposed startup of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Darlington</ENAMEX> nuclear station, a nuclear-power plant on Lake <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>, pending further safety studies.
The delay could result in tight Ontario power supplies this winter, which would force the province to import high-priced electricity from neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> states, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Hydro</ENAMEX> warned. The utility, which is owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> provincial government, also said a delay would hurt its efforts to curb acid rain by replacing old pollution-causing power plants with new installations.
The board said its staff needed more time to review the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Darlington</ENAMEX> plant's safety measures, particularly the software of a new computer-controlled emergency shutdown system.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Levesque</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atomic Energy Control Board</ENAMEX>, said the board was ``very much aware of the considerable costs involved in a licensing delay for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Darlington</ENAMEX>, but we must be satisfied that public and worker safety are assured.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Darlington</ENAMEX> plant is about 50 miles east of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>. Its eventual planned output of 3,524,000 kilowatts would be enough power to meet the needs of most of metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>. The plant, which is expected to cost about 12 billion Canadian dollars (US$10.13 billion) is to have four nuclear reactors. Construction of one reactor has been completed, another is 75% complete, a third is 35% complete and the fourth is more than 15% complete.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Hydro</ENAMEX> planned to start the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Darlington</ENAMEX> station Oct. 10 and test it for two to three weeks at about 1% of capacity. If tests were satisfactory, the utility planned to ask the board at its Nov. 2 meeting to let it to proceed to full operation.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levesque</ENAMEX> said it would take at least a month for the board's staff to complete a detailed review of the safety shutdown system and certain other aspects of reactor. The board blamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Hydro</ENAMEX> for the delay, saying it only received some essential data from the utility in recent days.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Hydro</ENAMEX> has experienced heavier than expected power demand because of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>'s strong economic growth. It has increased its electricity purchases from its neighboring provinces of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manitoba</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s exports of electricity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for the first six months of this year fell 35% from a year earlier to 11.55 billion kilowatt hours. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s imports of U.S. electricity during the same period rose 61% to 4.99 billion kilowatt hours.
