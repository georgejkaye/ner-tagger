<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol Records</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Berman</ENAMEX> resigned as president, effective today, ``to pursue other interests.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Smith</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of Capitol's immediate parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol-EMI Music Inc.</ENAMEX>, will take over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berman</ENAMEX>'s duties, with a new president for the label to be named soon.
Capitol is under the umbrella of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI Music Worldwide</ENAMEX>, which in turn is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s Thorn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI PLC</ENAMEX>.
Some industry people close to the company said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berman</ENAMEX>, 46 years old, was ousted in a dispute over management styles and future plans for the company with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Fifield</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI Music Worldwide</ENAMEX>. Others suggested that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berman</ENAMEX> may not have turned the company's operations around quickly enough for his boss's liking.
Industry estimates put Capitol's profit this year at between $9 million and $11 million.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berman</ENAMEX> declined to comment on his departure, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fifield</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> for comment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berman</ENAMEX> was brought in as president of Capitol two years ago when the label was losing money. Capitol had once made big money with such stars as the Beatles, but it had sufferd in recent years from a lack of top-selling new talent.
Part of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berman</ENAMEX>'s strategy focused on reviving the careers of former hitmakers like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonnie Raitt</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doobie Brothers</ENAMEX>, and on cultivating ``alternative'' groups who don't get much radio airplay now but who could be popular in a few years.
