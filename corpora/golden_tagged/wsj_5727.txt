In the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Wright</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Coelho</ENAMEX> ethics scandals, bills have been introduced to limit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacs</ENAMEX>, ban honorariums and restrict lobbying by former Members and congressional staffers. Status: All are stalled. But one ethics-related bill is doing very well, this one to place curbs on the outside lobbyists who often compete with Members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to get action from the executive branch. Its status: Passed in both chambers, with approval last week in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> by a vote of 410 to 3. Any businessman can see what's going on here: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is sticking it to its competition.
The anti-lobbyist bill requires anyone who is seeking a federal contract or grant to disclose the identity of the lobbyist who helped him get it. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>'s Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Byrd</ENAMEX> devised the bill after a private lobbyist beat him to the pork barrel for one of his constituents.
Recall that Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> stepped down as Majority Leader last year to chair the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX>, saying then that he'd now be in a better position to funnel money to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>. Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Virginia University</ENAMEX> discovered last month how seriously Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> took his renewed commitment to the pork barrel; he withdrew his support for a federally funded research center on their campus. The university had sinned against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beltway</ENAMEX> orthodoxy by hiring a lobbying firm to secure funds for the project. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> resented this. ``Why,'' he asked the school's officials, ``do you waste your money on a lobbyist when I'm being paid to be your Senator?'' He thereupon introduced his anti-lobbying bill, and his colleagues whooped it through both chambers.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beltway</ENAMEX> bellows on for yet another month about ``influence peddling'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. Ethics aside, one of the most interesting revelations from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal is that so many developers felt they had to bypass a largely Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and hire professional lobbyists to win contracts from a Republican administration. In fact, over the past decade the number of lobbyists has gone up by some 50%. Divided government is fostering competition -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> doesn't like it.
Of course, the Members resent the notion that there's anything analogous between what they call ``constituent service'' -- the pressure they exert on behalf of special interests or campaign contributors -- and what they call ``influence peddling'' -- defined as former Republican administration officials lobbying on behalf of paying clients.
This theological distinction was raised directly at one of the recent congressional hearings into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal. Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> Regional Administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Monticciolo</ENAMEX> had estimated that at least half of Section 8 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> contract decisions were politically motivated and went on to say that Members of Congress as well as former <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration officials had improperly lobbied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lantos</ENAMEX> asked: ``Would you like to rephrase your last few sentences, because they didn't strike a very reasonable chord?'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monticciolo</ENAMEX> quickly backed down from his heresy.
We have no real problem with Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX>'s attempt to force lobbyists into full disclosure, but why not mandate the same treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>? Executive-branch agencies already keep thorough records of their contacts with lobbyists, but not with Members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. A good way to tell which congressional calls to an executive agency are legitimate business and which are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Wright</ENAMEX>-style arm-twisting would be to have the agencies publicly report all contacts with Members and their staff on specific contracts or cases.
This idea was actually floated on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> recoiled more or less the way Bela <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lugosi</ENAMEX> did at the sight of a cross. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has just made such reports illegal: The current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior Department</ENAMEX> appropriations bill carries with it a measure that flatly prohibits its employees from logging any contacts with the legislative branch.
What's Congress afraid of? Perhaps if reporters or even average citizens had access to a record of such congressional interventions it'd become obvious what much of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> is all about. Voters might see that a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Congressman</ENAMEX>'s job today has less to do with forming public policy and more to do with helping special interests get their piece of the $1 trillion federal pie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> bakes every year. In turn, grateful Pacs underwrite their incumbencies.
It will be hard to take <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s handling of the ethics issue seriously until it subjects itself to the same commandments it keeps handing down for everyone else to obey. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> lobbying amendment should include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
