<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX>, after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building, has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower.
Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">One New York</ENAMEX> Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sol Atlas</ENAMEX> as part of its original lease in 1970.
The current transaction cost the bank approximately $140 million. Of that amount, $20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself.
The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers, most of whom will be moved to downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> after the bank's new back office center is completed in 1993. The move is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chase</ENAMEX>'s strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof. The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Plaza.</ENAMEX>
As part of its decision to leave the building, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chase</ENAMEX> tried to sell its interest, along with the Atlas estate's interest, shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Senior</ENAMEX> Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Scandalios</ENAMEX> said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chase</ENAMEX> and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $400 million to $475 million, but didn't get an offer for more than $375 million.
As the building's new owner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chase</ENAMEX> will have its work cut out for it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chase</ENAMEX> is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX>, whose headquarters is in the building, also plans to move shortly. In addition, another major building tenant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Mckinnon Securities</ENAMEX>, likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> real estate brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward S. Gordon Co</ENAMEX>. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants. Even with its striking views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> harbor, the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chase</ENAMEX> will have to spend approximately $50 million to remove asbestos from the premises.
