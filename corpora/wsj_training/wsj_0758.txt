<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Engelken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Thomson</ENAMEX> had never met, though for 38 years their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>, now a transit-association executive in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX>, a paper-products salesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montvale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, hadn't even talked to each other. But one recent day, they became much closer.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>, a rabid baseball fan, pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of ``my favorite and not-so-favorite teams and players.'' He often groans, he says, at the ``clutter'' of sports stories about drugs, alcohol, gambling and some player's  lament ``about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game.'' His morning paper, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>, even carries a sports column called ``Jurisprudence'' that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers. Like many sports buffs, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> has turned cynic.
But his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti-heroes, and about what Babe Ruth, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> reminds us, once called ``the only real game in the world.'' To Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>, it is also a story ``about love, because I'm blessed to have a wife who still thinks her slightly eccentric husband's 50th birthday deserves the ultimate present.''
To understand what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> means, one must go back to a sunny October afternoon in 1951 at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s Polo Grounds stadium, where, it can be argued, the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out.
It was the ninth inning of the third game of a three-game playoff between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn Dodgers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Giants (the predecessor to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> Giants scheduled to play in tonight's world series). Baseball fans throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> had sweated out a long summer with their teams, and now it had come to this: a battle between the two for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National League</ENAMEX> pennant -- down to the last inning of the last game, no less.
Some 34,320 fans jammed the stands, and shouted at the top of their lungs. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> was doing the same across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson River</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, where, with his nose pressed against the front window of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passaic-Clifton National Bank</ENAMEX>, he watched the duel on a television set the bank set up for the event.
The playoff series had riveted the 12-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> fan. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> struck first, winning the opener, 3-1, on a two-run homer off Dodger right-hander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recalls with precision today. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> got swamped in the second game, 100, and trailed 4-1 going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> scored once and had runners on second {Whitey <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lockman</ENAMEX>} and third <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">{Clint Hartung</ENAMEX>} as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> advanced to the plate.''
The rest, as they say, is history. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX>, a tall, Scottish-born, right-hand hitter, stepped into the batter's box. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> took a called strike,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recounts. The tension mounted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX>, again on the mound, stared down the batter. He wound up and let loose a fastball. The pitch sailed toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> high and inside and then, with a crack of the bat, was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands. ``Giants fans went into euphoria,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> was made a legend. The same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX>, it turns out, who sells those paper-goods today.
There can't be an older baseball fan alive who doesn't clearly remember that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> homer, who can't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Hodges</ENAMEX> radio broadcast -- the one that concluded with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hodges</ENAMEX> shouting, over and over, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> win the pennant, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giants</ENAMEX> win the pennant ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> drifted in different directions in the subsequent years, and the Polo Grounds, located under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coogan</ENAMEX>'s Bluff in upper <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, was replaced by a public-housing project. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> played outfield and third base until 1960, posting a lifetime.270 batting average and chalking up 264 home runs before retiring and going into paper-goods sales.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> moved south to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951. When his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX>, came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment: ``You look prettier than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX>'s home run.'' The couple's first dog, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX>, was named after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Event</ENAMEX>, though unwitting friends assumed he was the namesake of the poet.
And when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>'s sister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX>, who was born two days before the home run, reached her 25th birthday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote his sports hero to tell him of the coincidence of events. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> sent off a card to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX>: ``It doesn't seem like 25 years since I hit that home run to celebrate your birth,'' it read. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> was pleased, but nowhere near as much as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>.
The family license plate reads ``ENG 23,'' the first three letters of the family name and -- no surprise here -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX>'s uniform number. And on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>'s 40th birthday, his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> to be autographed. ``What could have been better?'' asks Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy Engelken</ENAMEX> asked the same question earlier this year, when her husband was about to turn 50. She had an idea.
On her husband's 50th birthday (after an auspicious 23 years of marriage, it should be noted), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy</ENAMEX>, Al and their college-bound son set out for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fordham University</ENAMEX>. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> had scheduled a stop on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> Turnpike to, she told her husband, pick up some papers for a neighbor. The papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10.
``It sounded like something out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Fleming</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> recalls.
At the appointed exit, the family pulled over, and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> went to get her papers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> turned off the motor and rolled down the window.
In a matter of minutes, she was back, with a tall, silver-haired man in tow. She crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertie</ENAMEX>,'' she said, ``Happy 50th Birthday. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX>.''
``And there he was,'' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>. ``The hero of my youth, the one person in history I'd most like to meet. Keep your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jeffersons</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Augustines</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michelangelos</ENAMEX>; I'd take baseball's Flying Scot without hesitation.''
They talked of the home run. ``I thought it was in the upper deck,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX>, now 66 years old. They talked of the aftermath. ``I never thought it would become so momentous,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby</ENAMEX> remarked. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX>, says his wife, ``was overwhelmed by the whole thing. It was worth it, just for the look on Albert's face.''
The two men spent an hour at Exit 10, rehashing the event, ``fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned 50,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> says. His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Branca</ENAMEX> ``a very fine pitcher.'' And when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he didn't even know, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Thomson</ENAMEX> replied: ``You know, Albert, if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy, you have an obligation to do it.''
In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX>, who is married and has three grown children, says he has few ties to baseball these days, other than playing old-timers games now and again. But his fans, to his constant amazement, never let him forget the famous four-bagger. His mail regularly recalls ``my one event,'' and has been growing in recent years.
In response to the letters, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> usually sends an autographed photo with a polite note, and rarely arranges a rendezvous. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betsy Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote him, saying she could stop near his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> home, it seemed different. ``What a good feeling it would be for me to do that,'' he says he thought.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> family got back from its trip up north, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> wrote it all down, just to make sure no detail was missed. ``On the way home,'' his notes recall, ``it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south. My mind was miles north at a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coogan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bluff</ENAMEX>, where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it.
``Take heart, sports fans,'' he wrote. ``Real heroes exist. You might not find one in the `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jurisprudence</ENAMEX>' column. But who knows? You might meet up with him at that bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> Turnpike.
