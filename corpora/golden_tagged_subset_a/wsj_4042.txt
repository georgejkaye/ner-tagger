<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West Inc.</ENAMEX> said it will post a $39 million pretax charge against third-quarter earnings as a result of a settlement reached with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> attorney general's office.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX> had profit of $283 million, or $1.55 a share, on revenue of $2.3 billion in the year-ago quarter.
The settlement ends a three-year dispute that erupted after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> telephone unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern Bell</ENAMEX> -- now called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West Communications</ENAMEX> -- was charged with attempting to ``wrongfully influence members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Utilities Commission</ENAMEX>.''
In 1986, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota Public Utilities Commission</ENAMEX> launched an investigation into the relationship between the utilities and former commissioners, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary R. Cunningham</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> special assistant attorney general. The investigation found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX>'s telephone unit allegedly tried to influence commissioners while they considered, and ultimately approved, a $57 million rate increase.
Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Humphrey III</ENAMEX> said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX> employee ``wined and dined'' two commissioners during the rate case.
Because of the alleged abuse, the commission ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX> to reduce rates by about $10 million a year in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX> unit appealed the decision to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota Court of Appeals</ENAMEX>, which ruled in 1987 that there was ``more than sufficient'' evidence that the company had tried to influence commission members.
The attorney general's office filed suit to recover the money for consumers, which with interest and taxes totals the amount of the settlement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX> said it believed ``our position was legally justified,'' but that it was in the ``best interests of our shareowners, our customers and our company'' to settle the dispute because ``litigation can be very expensive.
