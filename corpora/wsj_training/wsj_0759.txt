<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southam Inc.</ENAMEX> said its unprofitable weekly newspaper, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, is up for sale.
Analysts said the announcement, the latest in a series of divestitures and restructuring moves, is aimed at improving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southam</ENAMEX>'s earnings before the expiration in June of a standstill pact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torstar Corp.</ENAMEX>
When that agreement expires, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torstar</ENAMEX> will be free to increase its 22.4% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southam</ENAMEX>, or to make an offer for the whole company. Descendants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southam</ENAMEX> family hold an additional 22.6% stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based company, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s largest newspaper publisher.
The newspaper could fetch between 15 million and 20 million Canadian dollars (US$12.8 million to $17.1 million), said one analyst, who asked not to be identified. A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southam</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper's annual losses, which most analysts place at between C$4 million and C$7 million.
Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southam</ENAMEX> reported third-quarter earnings of C$10.8 million on revenue of C$395.4 million, down from C$14.6 million on revenue of C$389.6 million in the year-ago quarter.
``To be profitable, the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Macfarlane</ENAMEX>, the paper's publisher. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southam</ENAMEX> said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas.
The acquisition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> is ``well within reach for any number of media companies, both public and private,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Cole</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBN James Capel Inc.</ENAMEX>
Possible bidders include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Ondaatje</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> financier and vice chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hees International Bancorp Inc.</ENAMEX>, a holding company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronfman</ENAMEX> family. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ondaatje</ENAMEX> sold his stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pagurian Corp.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hees</ENAMEX> earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ondaatje</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Mac-Laren</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CB Media</ENAMEX>, a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines, said his company would take a close look at the newspaper.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> said the sale of the 77-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southam</ENAMEX> has owned since 1961, is consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southam</ENAMEX>'s strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while disposing of ``chronically under-performing'' assets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southam</ENAMEX> agreed to sell its 47% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selkirk Communications Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a broadcasting concern, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maclean Hunter Ltd.</ENAMEX> for about C$285 million last year. This year, it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales, while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> has no links to the British daily newspaper, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX>.
