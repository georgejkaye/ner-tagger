<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Di Giorgio Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, said ``a number of third parties'' have expressed interest in acquiring part or all of the food products and building materials marketing and distribution firm.
As previously reported, the company last month rejected as inadequate an unsolicited $32-a-share tender offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIG Acquisition Corp.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rose Partners Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> and its sole general partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Goldberg</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Di Giorgio</ENAMEX> directors left open the door for a suitor with a better offer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Di Giorgio</ENAMEX> said the most recent expressions of interest are preliminary, but it said the board authorized management and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX>, the firm's financial adviser, to continue to explore alternatives to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIG</ENAMEX>'s offer and to seek formal proposals for the sale of the entire company or some of its business units.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Di Giorgio</ENAMEX>, which has 5.1 million shares outstanding, closed at $33.75 a share, up $1, in composite trading Friday on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
``We're going to ask the board to live up to their fiduciary duty,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX>. He added, ``We're the only bid out there'' with financing. He said he expected to respond formally to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Di Giorgio</ENAMEX> announcement today.
