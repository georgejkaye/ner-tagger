While President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> continues to hedge on whether and when to restore full ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, other prominent Americans are rushing back in -- including the president's brother.
Prescott <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, on a business swing through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, spent the weekend in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> meeting with officials and potential partners for several <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>-investment deals.
The visit comes at a time of continuing uncertainty in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> business relations. Some U.S. businessmen have hesitated to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> or pursue new deals so soon after the June 4 massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, when troops opened fire and killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators.
Indeed, Bush administration policies continue to frustrate some U.S. business interests, both directly and indirectly. A continued arms-sales embargo has cost U.S. companies millions in export sales. And continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> travel warnings indirectly send the message to businessmen that it still isn't business as usual.
Nonetheless, the president's brother believes this is a good time to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
``We aren't a bunch of carrion birds coming to pick the carcass,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> says. ``But there are big opportunities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> can't afford to be shut out. We don't want to lose the market to the Japanese, the Germans or anyone else.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> chafes at suggestions, frequently raised by the media, that he is taking advantage of his relationship with the president to further his business interests. ``There's no conflict of interest,'' he says, referring to his involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. ``This is something that has been going on for years.'' But, he concedes: ``It doesn't hurt that my brother is the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asset Management</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Financing & Settlement Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a financial-services company that is trying to line up several investment projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, including a wood-processing venture and a satellite-linked computer data base network. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is a senior adviser to the company.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also will travel this week to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, where he is helping to build an $18 million joint-venture deluxe country club for expatriate residents. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has a 30% stake in the project, which, when completed, will include an 18-hole golf course, 12 tennis courts and other facilities.
While in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also will discuss plans to construct a $20 million town-house complex for foreign residents. He expects to take a 50% stake in that project.
In addition to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, other politically well-connected Americans are on their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. High-ranking U.S. officials still won't visit, but former officials are showing little hesitation in renewing old friendships in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Haig Jr.</ENAMEX>, secretary of state under President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> and currently chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide Associates Inc.</ENAMEX>, will give the keynote address Oct. 2 to a conference marking the 10th anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China International Trust & Investment Corp.</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citic</ENAMEX>, a state-owned multinational. Many top Chinese government leaders will be on hand.
A number of U.S. businessmen are boycotting the event -- which coincides with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s national day celebration Oct. 1 -- in light of events here in June. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citic</ENAMEX> is disappointed with the level of U.S. participation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX>, who has opposed sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and who has extensive business interests of his own in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, turned down an invitation to speak at the event. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citic</ENAMEX> got Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haig</ENAMEX> to replace him.) But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> will be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> in November, when he plans to hold private meetings with Chinese officials.
Another old friend of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX>, plans to visit before the end of the year. Word of the separate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> visits has been manipulated by the official Chinese media in an attempt to show people here and abroad that it's business as usual in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
