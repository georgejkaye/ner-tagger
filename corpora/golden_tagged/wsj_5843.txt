The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck & Co.</ENAMEX>'s new ulcer drug, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losec</ENAMEX>, for limited use in treating rare disorders caused by gastrointestinal acid.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> decided to initially restrict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losec</ENAMEX>'s use until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> conducts extensive studies regarding the drug's long-term safety. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losec</ENAMEX> is expected eventually to gain wide use in treating mild to severe ulcers and to provide an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tagamet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zantac</ENAMEX>, the most commonly prescribed medicines, which have combined world-wide sales of about $3 billion.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval for Losec only allows its use in treating inflammations of the esophagus and stomach lining, which cause a symptom similar to severe heartburn, and in treating a rare condition, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome</ENAMEX>, caused by excessive secretion of gastric acids. In March, an advisory committee to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> recommended the restricted approval because an early study of the drug in laboratory animals produced some cases of cancer. Human studies have yet to uncover such problems, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> advisory group said it nonetheless wanted lengthier safety studies.
Analysts who follow the pharmaceutical industry expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losec</ENAMEX> eventually to gain approval for wider use. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> said it expects to present safety data to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> next year. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Uhl</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Bros.</ENAMEX>, said that even with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> restrictions, many doctors will begin using the drug to treat patients whose ulcers don't respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tagamet</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zantac</ENAMEX>. Once a drug is approved for sale, doctors could prescribe it for ulcers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>, however, isn't permitted to market Losec to doctors as a common ulcer treatment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uhl</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losec</ENAMEX> may generate $100 million in sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> in 1990, rising to $400 million by 1992 if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> lifts its restrictions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losec</ENAMEX>, known also by the generic name omeprazole, was developed by a division of Swedish drug maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB Astra</ENAMEX>, which sells the drug in about 10 European countries. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rahway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> holds only the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> marketing rights to the drug. A European study, published January in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losec</ENAMEX> healed a greater proportion of ulcers faster and kept them healed longer than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zantac</ENAMEX>, which is sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaxo PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX>.
Sources close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> said the agency is impressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Losec</ENAMEX>'s effectiveness and is worried that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> granted an unrestricted approval, doctors might use the drug in great numbers before a fuller safety profile is produced. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> ``hopes the limited label will keep use down until everyone is more comfortable with the drug,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> source said.
