``The Famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>,'' a sitcom premiering tonight, is expected to be one of the hottest new shows on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> this season. The pilot is funny and well-written, but there's another reason ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>'' got on the air: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Wilson</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> had him.
Two seasons ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> canceled Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s critical hit ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>'s Place'' because of anemic viewership. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> unit didn't want to lose the talent of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, a writer and producer who had created such hits as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WKRP</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>,'' so it gave him a ``commitment,'' or a promise to air another of his efforts in the future. In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Television</ENAMEX> wooed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> away from another studio with an exclusive multimillion-dollar contract. That meant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> had to make a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> to get a show for the fall that would be produced and written by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>.
In the next several weeks, 25 new shows will premiere on the three major networks and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Fox network. Many came to fruition because producers were able to fit a complicated mix of trendy concepts (comedy is hot this year), network-writer relationships and favors into the holes each network needed to plug.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Television</ENAMEX> is this season's big-league studio with the most new series, a total of five. To bring in those winners, it vied with a half-dozen major studios and a few strong independent producers to anticipate the networks' needs. A look at the genesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s five winners provides a peek at the process by which programs get on the air and how a studio can rise to the top in television.
In recent years, the television unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> has followed a strategy of emphasizing comedy over drama and pursuing veteran hit-making writer/producers, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Wilson</ENAMEX>, with juicy contracts. Just as importantly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> never loses sight of the fact that the big money in TV production comes from selling reruns for syndication. As a result, it avoids presenting a series concept to a network that is topical or gimmicky and thus might have too short a shelf-life, regardless of whether critics would applaud its freshness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s winners this season demonstrate how it was able to mobilize its stable of writers, producers and actors to serve the networks' very specific needs. Take ``Living Dolls,'' an ABC series about four teen-age girls modeling in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, the kind of low-concept show critics get sniffy about.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> had decided that first-place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> was winning Saturday nights ``by default,'' getting no competition for its successful comedies, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Harbert</ENAMEX>, executive vice president, prime time, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC Entertainment</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specifically</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> wanted comedies that would appeal to the kind of people who stay home Saturdays, and hoped for that rarity, a show that appeals to both young viewers and mature ones.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> had attracted such a ``bi-modal audience'' with the long-running ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facts of Life.</ENAMEX>'' Knowing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> liked the idea of young models, the studio turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross Brown</ENAMEX>, a writer under contract who had worked on ``Facts of Life'' as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s popular ``Who's the Boss?'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was made head writer and executive producer on ``Living Dolls'' and told to make the show a ``planted spinoff'' of ``Who's the Boss?''
Spinoffs are created when a sidekick from a hot show becomes a central character for a new show,  as ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Tyler Moore</ENAMEX> Show'' begat ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhoda</ENAMEX>.'' In this case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> decided to run a special episode of ``Boss,'' now in its sixth season, in which the daughter of character <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony Micelli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony Danza)</ENAMEX> befriends another girl who is about to become a model. That hastily planted character will turn up four nights later on ``Living Dolls,'' and ABC can always have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony</ENAMEX> and daughter visit her in future episodes. This may seem uncreative, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s statistics-keepers know that fewer viewers than ever bother to try new shows and such a ploy may help.
``Free Spirit,'' a show about a pretty witch who plays housekeeper to a divorced attorney and his kids, is another frothy comedy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> liked the idea but rejected the first script, written by a playwright under contract to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> ordered a quick rewrite from a writer with another studio, and once the pilot was accepted, assembled a staff of writers from within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s ranks. One key was the right actress to play <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winnie</ENAMEX>, the witch, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> went for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corinne Bohrer</ENAMEX>, whom ABC happened to have in a ``holding deal.''
``There is no guarantee a network will put on a show just because you use an actor they're holding,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Siegler</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Television</ENAMEX>. ``But they liked the pilot, and I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corinne</ENAMEX> is the perfect cross between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Montgomery</ENAMEX> {of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bewitched''}</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldie Hawn</ENAMEX>.''
``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peaceable Kingdom</ENAMEX>,'' about a gutsy woman zookeeper who lives right on the zoo grounds with her kids and pet seal, is another one of those warm-hearted family shows that make critics cringe. But, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Lemasters</ENAMEX>, head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> programmer: ``We needed a lot of new programs at 8, and we thought this show could really help us out. We liked the concept when it was developed, but we were afraid it could be a little soft. We told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> it needed marquee value, somebody like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindsay Wagner</ENAMEX> with whom they had a holding deal, and that's exactly who they got.''
Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> is on the air with ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardball</ENAMEX>,'' a joint production with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>, which wanted the kind of male, action\ show that would attract young men on Friday nights the way ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> Vice'' once did. A script was written by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Productions</ENAMEX> staffer, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> wasn't satisfied and thought of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lupo</ENAMEX>, whose many successes included one that helped change <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s fortunes, ``The A-Team,'' and who had moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>.
``Hardball'' is a buddy show about undercover cops that teams a cocky, longhaired younger man with a bull-headed, paunchy older guy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> had long been trying to corner actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashton</ENAMEX> after such films as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> Cop,'' and he got the part of the older cop. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>, was keen on hiring a strong-jawed young actor named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Tyson</ENAMEX>, who is already being promoted as the season's new sex symbol.
Getting all these shows on the air, though, doesn't mean money in the bank for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. The amount networks pay toward production costs has stayed flat in recent years while the costs have escalated, so a studio can be out millions of dollars with no payback if a show doesn't last long enough to be syndicated -- and only about 9% survive that long.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Lieberthal</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Television</ENAMEX>, says that a popular sitcom starting now could pile up $25 million in deficits over four years, which is how long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> waits before it tries to sell a series to TV stations. However, he says, the syndication revenue for that show could exceed $100 million over four more years, the kind of bonanza that keeps studios going. He also claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> is so good at nursing shows along, keeping plot lines and characters fresh, that it manages to keep more than 30% of its shows on long enough to syndicate.
In fact, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieberthal</ENAMEX>, one of the main reasons Columbia wanted to do ``Living Dolls'' is that it's ``the kind of show local stations would want to run at 5 p.m. in reruns. If we're right and it lasts, it's very good business.''
