President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will offer some thoughts about LDC debt when he addresses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> annual meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> today. But he won't need to mention to the assembled bankers and finance ministers that international efforts to relieve LDC debt are in disarray. They already know that. If he has some fresh ideas they will be welcome, and particularly if he emphasizes the role <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LDC</ENAMEX> countries themselves must play in their own salvation.
Clearly, the idea of merely throwing more money at the problem is wearing thin. IMF Managing Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Camdessus</ENAMEX> has been trying to put the best face on the uncertainties surrounding whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> will soon get an increase in its quotas. Dutch Finance Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Onno Ruding</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s policy-making ``interim committee,'' tried to sound optimistic Monday about a quota-increase agreement by December. But whichever way the President swings -- and the signals have been highly ambivalent -- certain of his advisers, not to mention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, are skeptical of that timetable.
There is considerable unhappiness in those circles with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camdessus</ENAMEX>, whose reputation as a manager has not been enhanced by a record level of arrearages on IMF loans and other signs of bureaucratic lethargy. Some see the failed nostrums of the 1970s creeping back into IMF adjustment programs. Most important, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camdessus</ENAMEX> unwisely has created the impression that he doesn't much like to cooperate with Americans.
Then there is the rising dissatisfaction of private banks. The President's audience today will have clearly understood what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.P. Morgan</ENAMEX> was saying last Thursday when it announced that it was sacrificing reported earnings to create a $2 billion reserve against potential LDC debt losses. The implicit message: If sufficiently provoked, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> is prepared to opt out of the ``concerted lending program,'' through which private banks cooperate with governments, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> on LDC bailouts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> also have expanded reserves. A departure by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> quite possibly would mark the beginning of the end of private-bank cooperation and that could put debt relief on hold.
Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> itself, under former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber Conable</ENAMEX>, shows signs of disaffection. Departing from the usual platitudes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>'s latest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Development Report</ENAMEX> says, in effect, that most of the debt problems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LDC</ENAMEX> countries are their own fault. They have misused the capital previously borrowed by funneling it into inefficient state enterprises or industries controlled by politically favored elites. Don't cry for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>. Just tell them to shape up.
Now, of course, it should be acknowledged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> had a central role in creating the debt problem. The dollar inflation of the early 1970s, combined with price controls on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil producers, generated the ``petro-dollar'' surpluses of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> nations that banks recycled into overly generous loans to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ldcs</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> has a crucial point if it is saying that the solutions must begin in the capitals of the Ldcs themselves.
Private banks holding LDC debt have become restive in part because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> and his underlings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> have made forgiveness a centerpiece of debt-relief efforts. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> first wanted to compensate the banks by giving them guarantees on the debt remaining after partial forgiveness, but the British and Germans balked on that last spring. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> later pushed through the Mexican relief program, which does have a forgiveness element. But now bankers and finance ministers raise doubts that such a program can be repeated.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> clearly deserved relief because President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> had undertaken courageous political and economic reforms. But however much justification there has been for the Mexican program, the limitations of that model have become obvious. Reductions in debt service to be achieved through write-downs are limited. More to the point, banks are not keen on forking up new loans while forgiving old ones.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camdessus</ENAMEX> has been courting the Japanese, who are today's holders of large dollar surpluses, as potential angels for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ldcs</ENAMEX>. But while the Japanese would like to have a stronger role in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IMF</ENAMEX> deliberations in return for ponying up more money, it is by no means clear that they are prepared to buy into a Franco-Japanese alliance that would undertake to solve the problems of the world economy. They are not wild spenders.
So where does the IMF go from here? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inevitably</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> report suggests, it may have to shift more responsibility for solutions to debtor-nation capitals. But in forging any actual solution, that's where most of the responsibility belongs.
