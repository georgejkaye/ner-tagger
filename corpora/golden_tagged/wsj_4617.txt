Concerning your Aug. 31 article about the defense industry, ``Unsettling Specter of Peace Has Caused a War Among Analysts Over the Possible Consequences'':
The people who really should be speculating about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s ``peacemaking'' are our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> allies. Once American troops are returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve</ENAMEX> units, neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> is going to generate a lot of business by sending them back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> should the Russian bear growl.
Notwithstanding the obvious problems of returning troops to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> across an ocean infested by Russian submarines, the political impracticality of calling up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard and Reserve</ENAMEX> units (remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> Wall?) almost ensures that our NATO ``allies'' will be going to the next war by themselves.
