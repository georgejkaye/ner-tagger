Two rival bidders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught Biosciences</ENAMEX> extended their offers to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based vaccine manufacturer Friday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut Merieux S.A.</ENAMEX>, which offered 942 million Canadian dollars (US$801.2 million), or C$37 a share for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>, said it would extend its bid, due to expire last Thursday, to Nov. 6.
A C$30-a-share bid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a pharmaceutical company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Basel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron Corp.</ENAMEX>, a bioresearch concern, was extended to Nov. 16. It had been due to expire Friday evening.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> previously said it would ensure its bid remained open pending a final decision by Canadian regulators on whether to approve the takeover. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX>, a vaccine and bioresearch firm based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lyon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, is controlled 50.1% by state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone Poulenc S.A.</ENAMEX>
The Canadian government previously said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merieux</ENAMEX>'s bid didn't offer enough ``net benefit'' to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> to be approved, and gave Merieux an until mid-November to submit additional information.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> officials said last week that they are ``highly confident'' the offer will be approved once it submits details of its proposed investments to federal regulators.
Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>'s shares outstanding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut Merieux</ENAMEX>, which already holds a 12.5% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>, said that at the close of business Thursday, 5,745,188 shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> and C$44.3/NNP million face amount of debentures, convertible into 1,826,596 common shares, had been tendered to its offer. At the close of business Thursday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer. At last report, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> had 21.8 million shares outstanding.
Separately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Supreme Court</ENAMEX> said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Toronto</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> in connection with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> bid.
In a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>, the parties said they agreed that as a result of reaching a C415 million research accord, ``It is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits {of the case} at this time.''
Lawyers for the two sides weren't immediately available for comment.
The university had sought an injunction blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>'s board from recommending or supporting an offer for the company by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX>.
