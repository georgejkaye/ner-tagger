<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spicer & Oppenheim</ENAMEX>, the 14th-biggest U.S. accounting firm, which recently has been under financial pressure, said it lost its biggest public-audit client, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns Cos.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Montgoris</ENAMEX>, senior vice president, finance, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>, the holding company for Bear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX>, a large securities concern, said next year's annual audit would be done by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte & Touche</ENAMEX>, the fifth-biggest accounting firm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte & Touche</ENAMEX> was formed recently by the merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins & Sells</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touche Ross & Co.</ENAMEX>
``This was a very difficult decision because of our long association with Spicer,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montgoris</ENAMEX> said. ``But because of our development of many new products, including real-estate-asset securitization in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, we need a larger auditor to handle our global requirements.'' Spicer had been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>'s auditor since 1944.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven D. Oppenheim</ENAMEX>, chief executive partner of Spicer, said he isn't happy about losing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> but believes his firm is getting a lot of new business in bankruptcy and litigation-support work to make up for the loss. ``Also, we're going to continue to do a substantial amount of other consulting and special projects for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>,'' he said.
While neither Spicer nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> would disclose the annual fee for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> audit, other auditors estimate it at about $500,000.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oppenheim</ENAMEX> said that with mega-mergers of major accounting firms increasing, ``there is going to be vicious competition from the big, new firms to take away the larger audit clients of smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPA</ENAMEX> firms such as us, while we may gain some middle-market work from the merged firms.''
He estimated that Spicer's revenue for the fiscal six months ending this month will rise more than 10% from a year earlier. In fiscal 1989, ended March 31, Spicer's revenue rose only 7%, to more than $70 million, from fiscal 1988, when revenue rose 11%.
Spicer recently cut 10% of its 1,000-member staff at nine U.S. offices. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oppenheim</ENAMEX> said the firm is now seeking to boost its professional staff by 5% to handle new business.
As to a report that Spicer is in preliminary merger talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laventhol & Horwath</ENAMEX>, the seventh-biggest accounting firm, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oppenheim</ENAMEX> said ``a great number of {accounting} firms want to talk to us'' about merger. He declined to comment further.
