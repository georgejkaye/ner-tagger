Shares of Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX>'s family's newspapers apparently will go public at a higher price than underwriters first anticipated.
While the preliminary prospectus for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Newspapers Inc.</ENAMEX> estimated an initial offering price of between $17 and $20, the shares were priced at $21 -- indicating the issue is receiving a warm reception. Underwriters have been on a road show this week, pitching the issue to prospective buyers.
Only 3,592,800 of 23,167,000 Class A common shares are being offered to the public. The majority of Class A and Class B continue to be held by family members. All of the estimated $75 million in proceeds would go to selling shareholders.
The vice president isn't among those offering shares for sale. Other selling shareholders include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Depauw University</ENAMEX>, his alma mater.
