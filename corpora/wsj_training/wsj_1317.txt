Just five months after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Group</ENAMEX> was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Roman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said he is leaving to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, 59 years old, abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency, whose largest client is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>, to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>'s executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications. He will succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry L. Freeman</ENAMEX>, 57, who has said he will retire in December. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take ``executive responsibility'' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmond Safra</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Safra</ENAMEX>. The company later apologized and agreed to make $8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman</ENAMEX> is retiring, he will continue to work as a consultant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> on a project basis.
Ad industry executives weren't surprised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>'s decision to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy.</ENAMEX> The agency, under his direction, bitterly fought a takeover attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> before succumbing in May. And although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX>'s chief executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sorrell</ENAMEX>, have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other, people close to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> say he was unhappy giving up control of the company. Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX>, a financial man, to cut costs at the agency.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> will be succeeded as the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX>'s flagship ad agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX>, 50, who had been president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North American</ENAMEX> operations and who, like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX>, is British. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Brody</ENAMEX>, 56, will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations. He had been president of the international operations. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> also had overseen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Group</ENAMEX>'s two other units, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scali Mccabe</ENAMEX> Sloves advertising agency and its research division, but those units will now report directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> appears custom-made for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> job. Known as a traditional executive, he is very much in the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> mold. Moreover, after 26 years at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safra</ENAMEX> incident. He also is close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James D. Robinson III</ENAMEX>. Aside from working with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> advertising account for about 11 years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>.
The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> had been pushed out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX>'s top spot by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX>. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> flatly denied the speculation, saying Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX> had tried several times to persuade him to stay, offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine (The wine, naturally, was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX>'s brand, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> client). ``He asked me not to resign. The implication that I was pushed aside wouldn't be accurate,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX>, traveling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>, couldn't be reached.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> first approached him about the job in late September. According to industry executives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sutherland</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> commissioner from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>, was also a serious contender for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> job. Although it ultimately wasn't offered to him, he will be on retainer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> as an adviser on international matters. After talking on and off for the past four weeks, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> said, he agreed to take the job because ``it's the right time, it's a terrific opportunity, and I think I leave the company in very strong hands. It was my decision, not anyone else's.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX>, his successor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy.</ENAMEX> The two executives could hardly be more different. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> comes across as a low-key executive; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> has a flashier personality. During time off, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> tends to his garden; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> confesses to a fondness for, among other things, fast cars and planes. Industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX> takeover brought them closer together.
``I'm the guy who made him head of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, and recommended him {to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX>} as my successor. Would I have done all those things successively if I didn't think he was the right guy?'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> asked. He labeled reports of friction ``ridiculous,'' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX>'s boat in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>'s public relations and government affairs, among other things, but he won't be involved in its advertising, which is handled by the operating units. ``I consider this a second career,'' he said. He also will sit on the company's corporate planning and policy committee, made up of the top corporate and operating executives.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>'s departure isn't expected to have any enormous repercussions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX> executives said the move won't affect their relationships with the ad agency. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX>'s relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies' work, and will continue to be,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hurwitt</ENAMEX>, a vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX>.
But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> isn't as well-known to many clients. ``Ken was my key contact,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Nicholas Hahn</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cotton Inc.</ENAMEX>, which represents cotton producers. ``I don't know {Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX>} all that well. I haven't seen or talked to him in several years.''
And some analysts questioned whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> would have the skills <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> needs to turn the agency around. While the agency has done well in many parts of the world, its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office has had a dismal track record recently; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX>. ``I think {Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX>} is going to need some help. I think they need creative leadership, and I don't think they have it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma Hill</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim & Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX>'s top creative executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Berry</ENAMEX>, left the agency earlier this year. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Berry</ENAMEX> was a creative inspiration at the company, and nobody has filled that void,'' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>.
But other analysts said that having Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> succeed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> would make for a smooth transition. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> has been there a long time, knows the culture well, is aggressive, and apparently gets along well with'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sorrell</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Wallach</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert.</ENAMEX> ``It's probably a reasonable transition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hopefully</ENAMEX>, he'll be the answer to the problems they've had in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.''
Sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> Unit Close
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Sciences Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Segundo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, said it is close to making final an agreement to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Consulting Associates</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Sciences</ENAMEX> wouldn't disclose the proposed purchase price for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Consulting</ENAMEX>, which counsels companies on logistics and supply. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lord</ENAMEX>, managing editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consultants News</ENAMEX>, an industry publication based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fitzwilliam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.H.</ENAMEX>, said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Consulting</ENAMEX>'s approximately $15 million annual revenue.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi</ENAMEX>, which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Consulting</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the proposed sale.
