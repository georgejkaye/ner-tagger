<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, one of the country's oldest mutual fund management companies, to a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> managers and investment funds affiliated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA Associates</ENAMEX>.
In selling Keystone 10 years after acquiring it, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, company acknowledged that the mutual funds business hasn't had much synergy with its core insurance business. And it isn't the first insurance company to have second thoughts about owning a funds group.
``Insurance companies originally thought they would do cross-selling'' of funds and other products, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perrin Long</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> ``It really hasn't worked out.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, which acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Investors Group</ENAMEX> in 1982, sold the $37.1 billion funds group in August for about $406 million in cash and stock. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> kept $110 million in cash and receivables.
The selling price for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX>, which has $11 billion under management, wasn't disclosed. One insurance industry executive familiar with the recent market for fund groups said the price probably was between $110 million and $220 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> declined to comment on estimates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Kevin Landry</ENAMEX>, managing partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA Associates</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> venture capital concern, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX> initially will hold a majority stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX>'s management, by meeting its stated business plan, will be able to increase its stake to 50% ``over time,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landry</ENAMEX> said. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> officers will have the right to buy out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TA</ENAMEX>'s interest ``more than five years down the road.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bissell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive, said seven managers are participating in the buy-out. He said he intends to make all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston company</ENAMEX>'s more than 100 officers eligible to obtain equity stakes eventually, as part of the process of buying up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TA</ENAMEX>'s stake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX>, founded in 1932, distributes its funds through broker-dealers, as well as through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX>, and industry sources say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX> has accounted for a relatively small portion of sales.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX> has been one of the weaker-performing of the major fund groups in recent years, by most independent rankings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kanon Bloch Karre</ENAMEX>, a mutual-fund brokerage and research firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, ranks Keystone in the bottom 30% of 92 major fund families, based on performance over the past 13 years.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bissell</ENAMEX> takes issue with such ranking methods. Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keystone</ENAMEX>'s funds don't fall within fund-objective categories, and ranking them against other funds in those categories gives an unfair performance assessment, he argues. But he concedes that some of the group's stock funds have performed poorly during some periods in the past 10 years. ``We still carry that (track record) along, even though we think we've fixed the problem,'' he says.
