<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Emeryville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, said it entered into a five-year research pact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoffmann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Roche Inc.</ENAMEX> aimed at developing anti-cancer drugs based upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX>'s previous research into oncogenes. Oncogenes are altered versions of normal genes that have been shown to cause cancer.
Financial terms weren't disclosed. Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffmann-La Roche</ENAMEX>, in exchange for sharing in research and drug development costs, will be awarded exclusive rights to market any resulting drugs world-wide. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX>, in return, will receive royalties on such sales.
Oncogenes are present in an estimated 30% of all cancers. By unraveling their role in cancer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX> scientists believe they can ``establish novel approaches to the discovery of anti-cancer drugs,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX> said.
The collaboration is the second this year between the biotechnology concern and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffmann-La Roche</ENAMEX>, the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, drug and health-care products concern. In January, the two companies announced a similar pact to employ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX>'s gene-replication technology to develop diagnostic products for cancer, genetic disorders and certain infectious diseases.
