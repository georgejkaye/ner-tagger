<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s national tobacco company, known for making brown-tobacco cigarettes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gauloises</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gitanes</ENAMEX>, is branching out.
Concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products, it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes, but also into electronic car-parking payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores. Brown tobacco in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> is a more pungent, stronger grade than the lighter grade, or blonde tobacco, used in so-called American-style cigarettes.
``We aren't Philip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris Cos.</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertrand de Galle</ENAMEX>, chairman of government-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe Nationale</ENAMEX> d'Exploitation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrielle</ENAMEX> des <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tabacs & Allumettes S.A.</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seita</ENAMEX>. He says that because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seita</ENAMEX>'s profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices, he doesn't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> concern has done. (Last year, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seita</ENAMEX>'s net profit soared 150% to 461.6 million French francs ($73.5 million) on sales of Ffr27.68 billion-a  1.7% profit margin.)
Instead, he said in an interview, he is looking for ways to exploit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s network of 39,000 tobacco agents, most of them cafes. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seita</ENAMEX> doesn't own the French tabacs, its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities.
One proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>. Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines, which deliver little paper receipts, drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops. Once activated, the card would sit in the car's window, showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain. When the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and, if it showed time remaining, save it for later. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seita</ENAMEX> is a partner in the project, which was developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matra</ENAMEX> SA using Japanese technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seita</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matra</ENAMEX> currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service.
And Seita is considering further diversification. It wanted to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>'s French cracker subsidiary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belin</ENAMEX>, in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores, but lost the bidding to food group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSN SA</ENAMEX>. It currently is considering bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish Match Co.</ENAMEX> And it retains an interest in acquiring candies and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops.
It also is trying to shore up its tobacco business. Brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises now make up just 40% of the French tobacco market, half the level of about two decades ago. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seita</ENAMEX> retains a manufacturing monopoly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand.
So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seita</ENAMEX> has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label, and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondes</ENAMEX> in new packaging, similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco Gitanes. The aim, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Galle</ENAMEX>, is to win market share from imported cigarettes, and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying French.
