The suspension of trading in shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cie.</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> and its three listed insurance subsidiaries has sparked rumors of an impending defensive alliance with other European insurance or banking groups.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Financiere de Paribas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurances Generales de France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Munich</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allianz AG</ENAMEX> all are being mentioned as likely partners for the French holding company. The most persistent rumor is that one or more of them would invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> or in its insurance units, possibly accompanied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> reorganization.
All concerned parties declined to comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> has scheduled an announcement for Monday. Its shares were suspended Wednesday at its request, pending that announcement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX>, whose shares are broadly held, has been the target of heavy trading and takeover rumors off and on for years. Trading has been heavy again since August. It has long been expected to announce some form of anti-takeover move.
Most recently, state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurances Generales de France</ENAMEX> announced in a regulatory filing that it built up a stake of more than 5% in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brokers</ENAMEX> said it was uncertain whether the state group was friend or foe.
The trading suspension affected Navigation <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mixte</ENAMEX>, as well as its units Via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurances Iard</ENAMEX> on the cash market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Via S.A.</ENAMEX> on the unlisted market and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhin et Moselle Vie</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nancy</ENAMEX> unlisted market.
The suspension didn't affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX>'s listed non-insurance units. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> holds majority holdings in such varied concerns as Via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francaise de Sucrerie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generale de Transport et d'Industrie</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saupiquet S.A.</ENAMEX>, a canned-food concern. It also holds stakes in a wide variety of other businesses, including a large baking concern.
In 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navigation Mixte</ENAMEX> had net income of 989 million francs ($155.3 million) on revenue of 18.13 billion francs.
