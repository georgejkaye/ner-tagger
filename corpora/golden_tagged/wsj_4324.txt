<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin S. Ackerman</ENAMEX> filed a counterclaim in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chancery Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX>, accusing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asher B. Edelman</ENAMEX> and companies he controls of improperly purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> shares in an effort to block Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX>'s attempt to oust the company's board of directors, including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX>.
In the suit, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> alleges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelogic Trace Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> ``admitted'' in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filing that they bought up to 30% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>'s stock in anticipation of the battle over the board seats.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> contends in the suit that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> and his companies spent $17 million to buy the stock, endangering the companies' financial health.
A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> said the computer-products company has yet to review the suit. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX>, she said, ``has been sending us draft copies of the suit, and we've been advised by our lawyers that the claims are totally without merit.''
In a suit filed earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> accused Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> and a group of shareholders of violating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> rules in their effort to oust Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX>. The suit alleged that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> and the dissident group contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> shareholders without filing the proper proxy material. The dissidents own about 4.5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>'s approximately 10 million shares outstanding.
