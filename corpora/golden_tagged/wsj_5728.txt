<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX> confirmed it may have been defrauded on some big weapons contracts, as British government concerns mounted about the defense contractor's future.
In a statement to its 24,000 employees yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s third-biggest defense-electronics concern said, ``It appears certain that the company and its advisers have been at least misled, and possibly made victims of serious fraud'' in a subsidiary's contracts. The contracts, including a Pakistani arms sale whose value may have been overstated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s books, have been the subject of an intensive company audit since last week.
The statement was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s first mention of possible fraud in the contracts and underscores the company's deepening problems. Last week, when it indefinitely halted trading in its shares here, it cited only ``significant irregularities'' in the contracts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> audit focuses on contracts booked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal & Control Group PLC</ENAMEX>, headquartered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, an arms merchant with which Ferranti merged last year. Transactions involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal</ENAMEX>'s former chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Guerin</ENAMEX>, are being investigated by U.S. government agencies for compliance with U.S. export-license requirements and other laws.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> continued its weeklong reluctance to discuss any details of its problems, but one company official confirmed reports that auditors are examining whether certain contracts booked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal</ENAMEX> ever, in fact, existed.
Official concern over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s problems is growing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, amid market speculation that large contract losses may force a government-orchestrated rescue of the concern. Yesterday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Trade Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland Yard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serious Fraud Office</ENAMEX> confirmed they have had contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> over the contracts but are postponing any action until after the company reports its audit results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom King</ENAMEX> said he's ``very concerned'' about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s problems and hopes for a speedy resolution.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s problems put the British government in a pickle. Just last month, it blessed a restructuring of its defense-electronics sector by clearing the planned purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plessey Co.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siemens AG</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> was counting on Ferranti to be the main competitor of that new powerhouse, thereby ensuring competitive tendering on its electronics contracts. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s sudden problems could shred the government's plan and cause it political embarrassment.
Analysts estimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s possible loss on the questioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal</ENAMEX> contracts at # 150 million ($235.6 million) to # 200 million -- about three to four times its # 55.8 million pretax profit for the year ended March 31. Write-offs of that magnitude, said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Gleeson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> stockbrokers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams De Broe Hill Chaplin & Co.</ENAMEX>, could force <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> to seek a rescue by another defense contractor.
In an interview with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> yesterday, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Alunjones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s chairman, acknowledged that the scandal is expected to create ``a hole in {the company's} assets*... which we will ultimately have to replace.'' He said the options under review include selling assets and entering into a partnership with another firm. He said ``the information we relied on'' to merge the firms ``has proved to be incorrect.''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Tate</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>'s lawyer, confirmed that a federal grand jury there is conducting a separate investigation of his client's business transactions. That investigation began long before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> scandal became public.
