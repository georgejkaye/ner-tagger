The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> moves were good news for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>, which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Sikes</ENAMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> chairman, championed deregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> at his last job as head of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> telecommunications agency. But it has been an open question whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX>, an extraordinarily cautious man, would continue pushing deregulation at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure.
``It means that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> is serious about the deregulation of long distance,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Grubman</ENAMEX>, a telecommunications analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc.</ENAMEX>, who attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> meeting. ``All the commissioners were in amazing agreement {to re-examine regulation} for only having been together for a few months.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> took three specific actions regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T.</ENAMEX> By a 4-0 vote, it allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> to continue offering special discount packages to big customers, called Tariff 12, rejecting appeals by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> competitors that the discounts were illegal. Then by a separate 4-0 vote, it chose the narrowest possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan, called Tariff 15, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> gave a 5% to 10% discount to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, company that oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Inns</ENAMEX>, in response to a similar discount offered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Corp.</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> The agency said that because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s offer had expired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> couldn't continue to offer its discount plan. But the agency specifically didn't rule whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users.
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Nacchio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s vice president for business-communications services, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resort Condominium International</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, to meet another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> bid. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> ``didn't say I couldn't do it again,'' he said.
Apart from those two actions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sikes</ENAMEX> and the three other commissioners said they expect to re-examine how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> is regulated since competition has increased. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Firestone</ENAMEX>, chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s common-carrier bureau, said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> applauded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s actions. ``The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> telecommunications firm said in a statement. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, was displeased with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> decision concerning Tariff 12, arguing that ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> can not be allowed to flaunt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> rules.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Telecommunications Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Sprint</ENAMEX> unit said it was ``obviously disappointed'' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> decision on Tariff 12. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Sprint</ENAMEX> said was it will petition the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> decision in federal court. ``We believe that the court will find it unlawful,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Sprint</ENAMEX> spokesman.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> filed a countersuit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly ``false and deceptive'' advertising. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight. Earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> in federal district court, claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s ads are false.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> assembled three of its top executives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, all visibly angry, to try to refute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s charges. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> has made hawks out of the upper echelon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grubman</ENAMEX>, who said he expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis.
