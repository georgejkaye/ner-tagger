<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> maintained a hammerlock on its position as the top underwriter of stocks and bonds in the third quarter, but a paucity of lucrative underwritings continued to depress profits in the securities industry.
Despite a big drop in interest rates and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average's rise to record levels during the quarter, Wall Street still hasn't recovered from the shakeout sparked by the October 1987 stock market crash. Disclosed fees from new securities offerings plummeted $830 million, or 28%, to $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 1989.
Equity financings, the traditional money-maker for brokerage firms, fell 37% in the three quarters, and only $15 billion has been raised with stock so far this year, compared with $23.8 billion a year earlier. The volume of initial public stock offerings declined 48% to $9.8 billion from last year's relatively anemic $19 billion; and 151 companies have gone public so far this year, compared with 210 in the first three quarters of 1988.
Fees from common stock offerings fell about $640 million in the first nine months to $868 million from $1.5 billion. Not since 1984 have investment bankers made less money from underwriting common, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Data Co.</ENAMEX>
Even at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>, the top U.S. underwriter for seven consecutive quarters, competitors as well as analysts say its growing market share hasn't resulted in significantly greater profitability. ``The general problem continues to be that securities firms have allocated too many resources to businesses that aren't particularly profitable,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Eckenfelder</ENAMEX>, securities industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>
For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merrill</ENAMEX> has made its biggest push in the market for investment-grade corporate bonds. As interest rates declined, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> raised its market share more than four percentage points to 21.5%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> is the only firm that has increased its market share and new-issue volume for four consecutive years in the investment-grade bond market.
But underwriting investment-grade corporate bonds has been among the least profitable activities on Wall Street in recent years. ``Profit margins haven't been good for some time and aren't likely to get better,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perin Long</ENAMEX>, a securities industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> People at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> say much of its net income last year and so far this year was generated by its merchant banking division, which includes high-yield junk bonds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edson V. Mitchell</ENAMEX>, a senior managing director responsible for orchestrating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s rise to No. 1, concedes that increased competition has made the traditional underwriting business -- buying securities from corporations and reselling them -- tougher.
``When you integrate the new-issue effort with secondary market trading, you can be profitable,'' he says. ``We believe we have the best fixed-income distribution system in the world,'' and that's what he says will make money in the long run.
Whatever the case, the 36-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>, who is described by colleagues as tough and humorless, is a rising star at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill.</ENAMEX> He ousted several <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> colleagues who questioned his often-repeated assertion that rising market share and greater profitability in corporate bond underwriting are compatible. Thanks to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>'s efforts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> also seems to be getting business that would have been unlikely a year ago.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Export Development Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble Co.</ENAMEX>, traditional clients of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> to arrange large U.S. bond offerings. The same month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Gas PLC</ENAMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> to sell its first offering in the Eurobond market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> also has been the most active underwriter of new preferred stock issues this year.
In the first nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> expanded its share of the U.S. debt and equity underwriting market to 16.5% from 14% over the same period last year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX>, which ranked No. 2, had 13.6% of the market, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> had 11%, 10.9% and 8.9%, respectively, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Data.</ENAMEX> World-wide, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> also was No. 1, with a market share of 15.4%.
Overall, the volume of new U.S. issues of debt and equity totaled $214.5 billion in the first nine months, just above 1988's new-issue volume of $210.4 billion in the like period. A one percentage-point drop in interest rates this year helped raise the volume of new debt securities to a record $193.9 billion from $181.4 billion a year earlier.
Elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> capital markets, mortgage and asset-backed bonds issued in the first three quarters totaled $88.7 billion, or 41% of the U.S. debt and equity new-issue market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX>-grade corporate bonds totaled $79.3 billion, or 37%. High-yield junk bonds totaled $20.2 billion, or 9.4%.
Initial public stock offerings amounted to $9.8 billion, or 4.6% of the market; secondary common offerings, $5.2 billion, or 2.4%; convertible bonds, $3.4 billion, or 1.6%; preferred stock issues, $5.6 billion, or 2.6%; and taxable municipal bonds totaled $2.3 billion, or 1%.
Overseas, the volume of international debt and equity securities offerings climbed to a record $186.2 billion during the first nine months from $159 billion in the 1988 period. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Securities Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa Securities Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yamaichi Securities Co.</ENAMEX> dominated the Eurobond market, where corporations and governments issue securities outside their home markets.
