<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>, having rid itself of asbestos, now sells fiberglass, forest products, minerals and industrial goods. Heady stuff it's not.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s ownership is unusual, and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- investors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>-based concern, which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year, is controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust</ENAMEX>. The trust, which owns 80% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s stock on a fully diluted basis, is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims.
When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> stock to cash. But as an 80% owner, if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market, it would likely depress the price of its shares.
Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will, instead, seek to convert the company's shares to cash, in some sort of friendly restructuring that wouldn't involve just dumping stock on the market.
``Their principal asset is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> common stock,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Halis</ENAMEX>, who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabre Associates</ENAMEX>, an investment fund that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> shares. ``If they tried to sell, they'd be chasing their own tail. What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares.''
The trust isn't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> stock. However, the trust's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims. Its cash and liquid securities fell by $338 million in the first six months of 1989.
The trust also will receive $75 million a year starting in 1991 on a bond it holds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>. And, beginning in 1992, it will have a claim on as much as 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s annual net income. Even so, the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch. As of June 30, it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims, for an average of $40,424 each. (The average should drop over time, since the most expensive claims are being settled first). And as of midyear, settled but unpaid claims amounted to $136 million -- more than half the trust's total of $268 million in cash and marketable securities. ``At some point, we're going to need an infusion of funds,'' a person close to the trust says.
Even before then, the trust may be eager to unload <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> stock. It doesn't pay a dividend, and this trust needs income. Moreover, with 88% of its assets tied up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>, the trust is badly in need of diversification. ``Obviously, a diversified portfolio would have less risk,'' the person close to the trust says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> itself doesn't rule out a restructuring. Though the ink is barely dry on its new, post-bankruptcy law structure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bullock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s head of investor relations, says the company is continually pondering ``whether there is a better way to be structured. We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares,'' he says.
Of course, one option would be for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> to buy out the trust's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders. But the trust, in most cases, is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993. And both the trust and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that, in the asbestos era, tarred the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> name. Thus, analysts say, the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s other shareholders. ``This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders,'' one investor says.
Even if there is no restructuring, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> seems to be attractive long-term. Its stock, at 9 5/8, trades at about 8 1/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bullock</ENAMEX> says 45% of revenues are tied to construction. Analysts predict little or no near-term growth.
They are, nonetheless, high on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s management. ``It's one of the best in the business,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Dobi</ENAMEX>. And he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible momentwhen other construction-related firms are hurting and selling cheap. With a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 1-to-1 -- and $329 million in cash -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> is indeed actively on the prowl.
So far, as a price-conscious shopper, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> hasn't bought much. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kleinaitis</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duff & Phelps</ENAMEX>, says, ``Even though they have borrowing power, they have been disciplined about acquisitions.'' And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleinaitis</ENAMEX> says that with 80% of its stock in friendly hands, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul.
