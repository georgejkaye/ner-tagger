After enduring three days of heavy selling, the beleaguered Nasdaq over-the-counter market finally rebounded, rising sharply in hearty trading.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite Index jumped 0.7%, or 3.35, to 463.28. It rose more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> Composite, which improved 0.2%. Among bigger stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index rose 1%, or 4.56, to 453.05, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average was up 0.2%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bruno</ENAMEX>, head of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>, said the OTC market has a habit of lagging big moves on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. While the industrial average rallied on Monday following last Friday's collapse, the OTC market, which didn't suffer too badly during the correction, tumbled.
``Our market got hit a lot harder on Monday than the listed market,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruno</ENAMEX> said. ``We're just recovering and getting back to business as usual. I'm encouraged by the action.''
The trading pace was busy, with 4,343 issues and 147.6 million shares changing hands. Advancing issues beat declining ones, 1,271 to 811.
Much of the jockeying by OTC traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern California</ENAMEX>. As investors speculated about the long - and short-term implications, shares of a number of companies that might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded. Heading the list: insurance, construction and technology companies located in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX>.
Insurance-related stocks were mixed as investors tried to figure out how  to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns. Traders said property-casualty companies with the heaviest exposure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area include the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OTC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Casualty</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gilmartin</ENAMEX>, a trader who follows insurance stocks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox-Pitt Kelton</ENAMEX>, said his strategy was to sell early.
Then, if the stocks fell sharply, he planned to begin buying them aggressively, on the theory that the companies that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims they will pay to earthquake victims and victims of last month's Hurricane Hugo. As well, reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits.
Many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry, which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilmartin</ENAMEX> said the hurricane damage wasn't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts. ``The companies just gave back what they had reserved for,'' he said. ``Now, they'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the future and that means rate increases.''
Overall OTC insurance issues were mixed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safeco</ENAMEX> fell 1/8 to 32 5/8 on 462,900 shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Casualty</ENAMEX> rose 1/4 to 51 3/4 on 137,200 shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul Cos.</ENAMEX> jumped 2 to 59 3/4 on 517,500 shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy Insurance</ENAMEX> fell 1/32 to 1 3/16; but volume totaled 1.2 million shares. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Insurance Index</ENAMEX> jumped 4.15 to 529.32 on the day, while the barometer of big insurance and banking issues climbed 1.72 to 455.29.
Investors expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungard Data Systems</ENAMEX>, a company that provides disaster recovery services for computer-dependent businesses, to profit from the earthquake. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungard's</ENAMEX> stock rose 1 3/4 to 21 1/4 on 194,000 shares.
Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kasler</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> road and bridge builder, were heavily traded, jumping 2 1/8 to 9 7/8 on 1.3 million shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy F. Atkinson</ENAMEX> added 7/8 to 16 7/8, on 335,700 shares. The company, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, provides industrial infrastructure engineering and construction services.
Traders were initially nervous about shares of companies, including many leading OTC computer companies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> with offices in the vicinity of the area damaged by the quake. But most of those stocks fared well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> gained 1 to 48 1/4; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashton-Tate</ENAMEX> rose 3/8 to 10 3/8. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX> also added 3/8 to 33 7/8. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems</ENAMEX> slipped 1/4 to 17 1/4. Shares of biotechnology companies in the area were also higher. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> was up 1/2 to 27 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX> gained 1/2 to 16 3/8.
The stocks of computer-related companies located outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> improved, too. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> advanced 1 7/8 to 80 1/2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus Development</ENAMEX> added 1 1/4 to 32 1/2.
In other earthquake-related news, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX>'s OTC market makers were excused from trading yesterday and its positions were frozen for the day by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Securities Dealers</ENAMEX>. Power couldn't be restored at the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> headquarters to allow trading yesterday morning. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Killion</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambrecht</ENAMEX> executive vice president, said he expects OTC trading at the company to resume this morning, either in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
In other trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medco Containment Services</ENAMEX> gained 7/8 to 15 on 1.9 million shares after reporting a loss for the first quarter, which ended Sept. 30. The company earned $6.6 million in the year-earlier quarter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s American depositary receipts added 3/8 to 10 3/4 on volume of 1.1 million. Analysts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> believe investors, despite their stampede to dump takeover stocks, should hold on tight to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares, this newspaper's Heard on the Street column said yesterday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen</ENAMEX> rose 1 1/2 to 50 3/4 in heavy trading. Analysts figure Amgen could benefit as a result of troubles facing its competitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics Institute</ENAMEX>, over the anti-anemia drug EPO. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics Institute</ENAMEX> disclosed recently that it is embroiled in a dispute with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boehringer Mannheim</ENAMEX>, which distributes the drug, regarding the usability of some batches.
