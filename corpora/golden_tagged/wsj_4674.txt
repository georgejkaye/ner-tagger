Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Capital</ENAMEX> is engaged in ``nothing current'' concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Savings.</ENAMEX> He said the matter is ``a file item that could be opened, but at the moment we aren't giving it priority.
