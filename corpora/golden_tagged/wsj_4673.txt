<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P Co.</ENAMEX>, owner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pabst</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Falstaff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl</ENAMEX> brands of beer, said it will try to block the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh Brewery Co.</ENAMEX>'s assets by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> sixth-largest brewer, said it will file suit in federal court alleging that a combination of the two brewers would violate antitrust law. The company also said it will participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> hearings on the proposed merger.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Golden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> said it had no comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX>'s plans.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> has signed an agreement in principle to acquire most of the beer assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh</ENAMEX> for $425 million. The purchase would give Coors the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schlitz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stroh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Milwaukee</ENAMEX> brands, among others, and requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> approval.
The acquisition would increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX>'s market share to about 20% from about 9%. Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch Cos.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, has about 43% of the domestic beer market and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller Brewing Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>-based unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX>, has about 22%.
``There are already two giants,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bitting</ENAMEX>, general counsel for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX>, and the acquisition ``would take two second-tier brewers and make them another giant, creating an oligopoly.''
In a prepared statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray S. Cutbush</ENAMEX>, president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. Heileman Brewing Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp Holding Ltd.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, said he doubted that the merger would pass ``rigorous antitrust guidelines,'' given the concentration in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> beer market. He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heileman</ENAMEX> is reviewing the issues raised by the combination with antitrust counsel and will ``advance its position in the appropriate form at the appropriate time.''
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said the company doesn't plan any action to block the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh</ENAMEX> deal. ``But we're still watching,'' he said. Spokesmen for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> didn't respond to inquiries about the company's position.
