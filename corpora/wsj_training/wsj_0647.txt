<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBI Inc.</ENAMEX> said that it can not pay the Oct. 31 dividend on its Series A convertible preferred stock, allowing the stock's holder to convert the shares into as much as 27.7% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBI</ENAMEX>'s shares outstanding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBI</ENAMEX> said that it has the funds to pay the dividend, but that it doesn't have the surplus or profit required under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> law for payment of the dividend. All the preferred stock is held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon</ENAMEX> Office Supply Stock Ownership Plan.
Under terms of the stock, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yukon ESOP</ENAMEX> can demand that the stock be redeemed for $4,090,000 on Nov. 30, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBI</ENAMEX> said it is legally prohibited from making the redemption. Failure to pay the dividend allows Yukon to convert all or some of its shares into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBI</ENAMEX> common after Nov. 30, at a conversion price based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBI</ENAMEX>'s closing stock price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBI</ENAMEX>, a maker of word-processing systems, said it can't predict if any of the preferred stock will be converted.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBI</ENAMEX> also said it has hired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> as its financial adviser and investment banker to help it restructure financially and improve its balance sheet.
