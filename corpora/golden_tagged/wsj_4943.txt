Consumer-electronics companies will sell a record $4.5 billion of color televisions, camcorders and videocassette recorders in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> in the fourth quarter, up 9% from a year earlier, predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Holleran</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Consumer Electronics</ENAMEX>' U.S. sales and marketing division.
At a news conference yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holleran</ENAMEX> cautioned that few consumer-electronics companies would realize profits from those sales because the industry ``remains constricted by excessive competition.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holleran</ENAMEX> estimated that 22 million color-television sets will be sold in 1989. Since 96% of all U.S. households now own a color television set, he says, that means 24% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> homes will have more than one color set. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>-based subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, sells consumer electronics in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> brands, which it acquired when it bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s consumer-electronics business last year.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holleran</ENAMEX> said industry color-television sales were up 12% through August, which he attributed, in part, to stable prices. He said camcorder sales should reach 2.3 million units for 1989, up 13% from last year but below some analysts' projections. Only VCR growth, he said, is likely to decline. Continuing a strong trend, large-screen color television -- sets with screens bigger than 25 inches -- was the sales leader in the first half, running about 23% ahead of 1988 sales. Large-screen sets with stereo sound have established an even higher growth rate, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holleran</ENAMEX> said; during the month of June alone large-screen stereo TV sales were 50% higher than a year earlier, he said.
Looking toward 1990, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holleran</ENAMEX> predicted that the strong sales growth in large-screen and stereo-sound television sets would help the industry's bottom line because these sets, which feature the latest in technological gadgetry, have higher profit margins.
Unit sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VCR</ENAMEX>'s -- now in the nine million to 10 million range -- will likely hold steady for the next few years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holleran</ENAMEX> estimated, because videocassette recorders have become a ``relatively mature product.'' However, he predicted that more of those sales could fall in the high end of the market. ``As the demand for stereo television grows,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holleran</ENAMEX> said, ``so will the demand for stereo <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vcrs</ENAMEX>.''
Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> brand of products, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holleran</ENAMEX> said ``we held our own'' in market share for color television and camcorders and gained three points in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">VCR</ENAMEX> share during the first half. The company this month launched a new advertising and merchandising campaign targeting traditional RCA customers as well as the ``younger, growing video generation,'' he said.
