Your Aug. 29 article ``Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, a Band of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reaganites</ENAMEX> Continues Fight to Slash Funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal</ENAMEX> Aid to the Poor'' could not have had a more misleading headline. As the article mentioned, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX> has, since its creation in 1974, misappropriated funds earmarked for the poor and used them to finance left-wing political causes.
The Reaganites on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> board have sought to increase legal aid to the poor by stopping this misappropriation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> should be more appropriately named the ``Left-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wing Services Corp''.</ENAMEX> because of this gross abuse of taxpayers' funds. Worse, however, is the fact that conservative activists now have their snouts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSC</ENAMEX> trough and are misappropriating LSC funds for their own pet causes.
What's needed is a legal-services voucher to eliminate the need for politically motivated legal-services middlemen, both liberal and conservative.
