<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins Engine Co.</ENAMEX> said the rising number of its shares bought by acquisition-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd.</ENAMEX> still appears to be for investment purposes.
But Wall Street didn't seem to agree. In composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> shares closed at $63, up $1.625.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial</ENAMEX> Equity said in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filing that it raised its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> to 11.5%. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Equity</ENAMEX> disclosed that it held a 9.9% stake, saying it bought the shares for investment purposes but reserves the right to change its plans. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Equity</ENAMEX> officials couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> spokeswoman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, said management at the diesel and automotive parts maker doesn't know of any change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Equity</ENAMEX>'s plans. But she conceded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cummins</ENAMEX> has little information about its big investor except for a sketchy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial</ENAMEX> Equity is a vehicle for British and U.S. investments and acquisitions for Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Brierley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX>. Last year, he made an unsolicited and unsuccessful takeover bid of $986.6 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calmat Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, prompting it to announce a restructuring including asset sales and a stock buy-back. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calmat</ENAMEX>'s interests include concrete, asphalt and land development.
Through a network of companies, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald</ENAMEX> controls businesses ranging from auto distribution in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> to cemeteries in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>. In some cases Brierley-controlled companies have sold their holdings back to the U.S. companies at a premium. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Equity</ENAMEX> sold back an 18.6% block of stock it held in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ameron Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monterey Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, pipe and concrete maker, for $2.50 a share more than the market price on the day the purchase was announced.
Securities analysts can't recall Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald</ENAMEX>'s acquiring a major U.S. company yet. Nevertheless, his stake is the second in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> by a foreign company in the past 10 months. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the founding family at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanson USA</ENAMEX>'s 8.8% stake for $72 million, ridding itself of that distraction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanson USA</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanson PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
Analysts have speculated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Equity</ENAMEX> stake may be an attempt at some form of ``greenmail'' -- forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> to buy back the stake at a steep profit. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanson</ENAMEX>'s stake was bought back in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, it was descendants of the founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cummins</ENAMEX> family, rather than the company itself, who paid. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins</ENAMEX> and the family acclaimed the purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanson</ENAMEX> stake, saying it wasn't greenmail, analysts said the transaction may make such a stake more inviting to investors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cummins</ENAMEX> is rebounding from an earnings slump last year. In the second quarter, net income was $23.9 million, or 83 cents a share, up from $1.7 million a year earlier, when preferred dividend requirements exceeded any per-share profit. Sales rose 18% to $982 million from $834.4 million.
