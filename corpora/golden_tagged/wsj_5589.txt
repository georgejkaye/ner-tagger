<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Juan Royalty Trust</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, won't pay a cash distribution to unit holders of record Sept. 29, according to its trustee, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas American Bridge Bank</ENAMEX>.
Terms of the royalty trust require that expenses in excess of revenue must be recovered from future months' income before distributions can be made. Increased capital costs, decreased production and a lower sales price of natural gas have created a cumulative negative amount of approximately $874,000 that must be recovered from future royalties, the trustee said.
The trustee also said it has been advised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southland Royalty Co.</ENAMEX>, which operates the trust properties, that royalty income for the next several months may remain negative or negligible because of the additional costs of drilling coal seam gas wells and seasonally depressed spot-market prices.
The trust's most recent distribution was 0.2451 cents a unit, paid Aug. 14.
