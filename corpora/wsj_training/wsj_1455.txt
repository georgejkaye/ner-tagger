Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant, architect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Mcdonough</ENAMEX> seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting. He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts. ``Look how much air is moving around '' he says. ``The ventilation here is great ''
You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> and his preoccupation with clean air. After years of relative obscurity, he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution, tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues, and avoiding mahogany, which comes from endangered rain forests.
He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quilted Giraffe</ENAMEX> restaurant -- ``architecturally impeccable,'' Progressive Architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX>, the Madison Avenue clothing store. He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space. He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coconuts</ENAMEX>.
What really stirs his muse, though, is aerobic architecture. Now the question is: Is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> ready for it? Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet, the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warsaw Trade Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, the first such center in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
The project has already acquired a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> cachet. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays. Some of the sales proceeds will go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Design Industries Foundation</ENAMEX> for AIDS. A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s in December.
If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX>'s plans get executed, as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum, steel and glass recycled from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>'s abundant rubble. A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space. Solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow. The windows will open. The carpets won't be glued down, and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes.
To the extent that the $150 million budget will allow it, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> will rely on solid wood, rather than plywood or particle board, to limit the emission of formaldehyde.
If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> has his way, the Poles will compensate for the trade center's emissions of carbon dioxide, a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear. The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $150,000, with the center's developer footing the bill.
The news hasn't exactly moved others in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX>'s profession to become architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Appleseeds</ENAMEX>. All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burgee</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm is designing the redevelopment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> Square, ``but we can't all carry it to that extreme.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Nichols</ENAMEX>, senior associate at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Graves</ENAMEX>'s architecture firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, says: ``We're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> responds: ``I'm asking people to broaden their agendas.''
The son of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX>'s executive who was stationed in many countries around the world, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and attended 19 schools in places ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shaker Heights</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, before entering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dartmouth College</ENAMEX>. He earned a master's degree in architecture from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>.
His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth. He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iceland</ENAMEX>. Living in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, he says, made him sensitive to the limits on food, power and water supplies. At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers.
He and a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dartmouth</ENAMEX> roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vermont</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX>'s first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Defense Fund</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big, operable windows.
Since the 1970s energy crisis, some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect: high indoor pollution. To reduce it at the fund's building, workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director's office. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jute</ENAMEX>, rather than a synthetic material, lies under the tacked-down carpets, and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic.
The budget was only $400,000. ``Athens with Spartan means,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> says. The fund's lawyers work in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenian</ENAMEX> grove of potted trees. Economists and administrators sit along a ``boulevard'' with street lamps and ficus trees. In offices, triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight. Offices with outside windows have inside windows, too, to let in more real daylight.
``We proved a healthy office doesn't cost more,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic Krupp</ENAMEX>, executive director of the fund.
It ``really looks beautiful and is very light,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Hornaday</ENAMEX>, a free-lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings. But, she says, ``I guess I didn't really notice the trees. Maybe they were hidden by all the people.''
Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quilted Giraffe</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX> renovation reflects much of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX>'s environmental concern. The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling, crystalline ``geode.'' It makes extensive use of stainless steel, silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors. To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX>, however, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country.
The ambitious Warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials. Its developer is a Polish American, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sasha Muniak</ENAMEX>. He had worked with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center. The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment, not readily accessible in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> now, for a growing number of Westerners doing business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonough</ENAMEX> thinks of the center as the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eiffel Tower</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>'' and ``a symbol of the resurgence of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>.'' If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Mathews</ENAMEX>, vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Resources Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, says that perhaps a quarter of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution. The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle Ages</ENAMEX>.
The future of the forest remains uncertain. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muniak</ENAMEX>'s company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balag Ltd.</ENAMEX>, has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it, but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained. After all, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muniak</ENAMEX> says, ``in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> there aren't too many people worried about the environment. They're more worried about bread on the table.
