U.S. auto makers will begin the 1990-model year with a whimper next week as slow sales of some models force the Big Three to temporarily idle at least nine car and truck assembly plants.
The closures are the latest sign that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S</ENAMEX> car makers could face rough going for the rest of the year. Companies have already cut back on their fourth-quarter production schedules and put consumer and dealer incentives on many of their 1989 and some of their 1990 model cars.
But the closings next week indicate the incentives and previously announced cutbacks aren't enough to keep inventories under control.
Such control is especially important now, as 1990 models begin rolling out of assembly plants. Some of these models are headed for dealer lots already crowded with 1989 models.
``Auto makers are willing to take {production} cuts instead of doing something drastic'' such as cutting prices, said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Qualls</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro-Economics Ltd.</ENAMEX> Stickers on most 1990 domestic models are rising significantly from 1989 levels, partly because of new safety equipment.
Almost 24,000 workers will be laid off because of the plant closings.
The largest number of shutdowns will come at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> Company representatives said the No. 1 auto maker temporarily closed a truck plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, this week and next week will idle truck plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shreveport</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La.</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moraine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>. The three plants, which employ a total of 6,900 workers, all build compact pickups and sport utility vehicles. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> plant is scheduled to reopen Oct. 16. The other two plants are expected to resume production a week later.
Two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> car plants in Bowling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del.</ENAMEX>, also will close temporarily next week for inventory adjustment. Bowling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX>, which builds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> Corvette, is slated to reopen Oct. 9, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, which builds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corsica</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beretta</ENAMEX>, will remain closed until Oct. 16.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> also will close for one week its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairfax</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>, assembly plant, which employs about 4,000 workers, to ``adjust'' parts deliveries from suppliers, a company spokeswoman said. The plant builds the Pontiac Grand Prix. As of the end of August, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> had a 99-day supply of the two-door cars; a 60-to-65-day supply is normal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has scheduled overtime this week at assembly plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Janesville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wis.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lordstown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, that build more popular products: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> Cavalier, Pontiac Sunbird, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> Lesabre and Oldsmobile 88.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> said it will shut for two weeks its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loraine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, assembly plant and close for one week its truck plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville Ky.</ENAMEX>, because of ``a shortage of dealer orders,'' the company said. About 2,700 employees will be affected by the downtime at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Loraine</ENAMEX> plant, which builds the Thunderbird and Cougar. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> truck plant builds medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks and employs about 2,000 hourly workers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> is temporarily closing two assembly plants next week for slow sales. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Assembly</ENAMEX> Plant No. 1, which employs 3,300 hourly workers and builds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge Daytona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Lebaron</ENAMEX>, will resume production the week of Oct. 9. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge City</ENAMEX> truck assembly complex in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warren</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, will resume production the week of Oct. 16. That plant employs 2,700 hourly employees.
Meanwhile, the nine major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto makers plan to build 149,601 cars this week, down 4.4% from 156,445 a year earlier and 1.7% lower than last week's 152,135.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamond-Star Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Normal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, a joint venture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> worked two hours a day of overtime this week. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> also scheduled overtime this week at a total of three U.S. plants.
