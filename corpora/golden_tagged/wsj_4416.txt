<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s exports of cars, trucks and buses increased from a year earlier for the first time since March, inching up 2.1% to 446,614 units, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> officials ascribed the gain chiefly to stepped-up shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oceania</ENAMEX>.
The increase in August was the first since exports showed a 19% rise in March, totaling 547,798 units.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s auto exports were sluggish for some time because of slumping shipments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, where Japanese manufacturers have started production in increasing numbers and have made exports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> unnecessary.
