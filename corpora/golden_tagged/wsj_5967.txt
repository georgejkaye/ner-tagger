<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> stock prices fell sharply Friday in relatively active volume ignited by large early sell programs and an uncertain opening on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>. But the market rallied from intraday lows on the back of limited new account buying.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> was closed for a holiday.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Monday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index of 225 stocks rose 38.21 points to 34440.09 just after the market opened.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> Friday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 100-share index closed down 15.5 at 2366.5, its lowest close since the 2360 on Aug. 17.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>-SE 100 showed some resilience after it rebounded from a session low of 2352.7, down 29.3. But dealers noted renewed pressure in late dealings as Wall Street lost early gains. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>-SE 100 never recovered to again test an early high of 2388.1.
The narrower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 30-share index settled at 1949.7, down 16.1. Volume was among the highest in recent weeks at 725.9 million shares, up from 515.5 million Thursday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries</ENAMEX> paced <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> to early gains after news that the U.K. Panel on Takeover and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mergers</ENAMEX> decided to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> time to clear regulatory proceedings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> before completing its # 13.4 billion ($20.8 billion) offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T.</ENAMEX> Later Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> said it will appeal the decision. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> closed at 819 pence ($12.71), up 18 pence (28 cents), although it had been bid as high as 830 during the session.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ranks Hovis Mcdougall</ENAMEX>, the food-products concern that often reacts counter to B.A.T price action because of a large stake held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> principals, closed at 448, down 15.
Dealers said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> showed signs of extreme nervousness, particularly in the later stages of the session, when Wall Street reversed early gains. The reversal in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> prompted a spurt of profit-taking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and some extremely choppy price action.
Light new account buying helped rally some shares late in the day, but overall the lack of aggressive buying at the start of the two-week trading account lent some credence to expectations that the market is poised for further declines.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Plaster Board</ENAMEX> closed at 255, up 15, on new account buying and talk of possible takeover interest in the company. The talk, however, hasn't been pinpointed even though the company's shares have been firming in recent sessions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadbury Schweppes</ENAMEX> closed at 399, up 10, on some fresh account buying, but also on talk of position-building by a possible suitor. Dealers also noted rumors that a large shareholder moved to sell its shares to an outside party. Neither rumor was confirmed.
Other takeover rumors also boosted selected shares counter to the market's overall decline.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Biscuits</ENAMEX> closed up 6 at 393. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland Bank</ENAMEX>, which has been rumored as a possible target for weeks, settled 4 higher at 379.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storehouse</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> retailer, finished unchanged at 145. The company disclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asher Edelman</ENAMEX> boosted his stake to 9% from 8.13%.
Dealers said the news helped support Storehouse, but they added that U.K. retailers have been receiving a lot of attention recently in takeover speculation, which muted chances for big gains in the company's shares.
``There's still a lot of corporate activity,'' a dealer said. ``We seem to be getting a bid a day, either rumor or fact. But what the market needs is some confirmation. It may be getting tired of talk.''
