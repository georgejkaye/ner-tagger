The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> set the stage for a debate over how to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> flag, sending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> competing measures designed to circumvent a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling that bars punishing a person who burns the flag as a political protest.
On a 9-5 vote, the panel approved a proposed statute that would prohibit desecration of the flag. The committee then voted 8-6 to send the Senate a constitutional amendment barring such desecration, with the recommendation that it not pass. The full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> is to consider the statute no later than Oct. 7 and vote on the constitutional amendment by the following week.
Congressional Democrats, wary of tampering with the First Amendment, want to try a statutory remedy, while Republicans, led by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, argue that only a constitutional amendment would protect the flag.
Last week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> voted 380-38 to approve a statute, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>) has promised to schedule a vote on a constitutional amendment after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> acts on it.
In June, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> threw out the conviction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration because he was ``engaging in political expression'' that is protected by the First Amendment.
