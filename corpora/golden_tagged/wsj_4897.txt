Loose talk about the special relationship between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> was once again in the air when I found myself here in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northamptonshire</ENAMEX> recently. As an antidote to the pseudo-history in the press, I decided to walk two miles down a country road and visit this village, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Washington</ENAMEX>'s ancestors are buried and where the Tudor manor house from which his great-great-grandfather emigrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> in 1656 still stands.
Were it not for this historical connection Sulgrave would no doubt be as unvisited as its neighboring small villages, tucked away in rolling farmland, but in 1914 a body of British subscribers, headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King George</ENAMEX> V, bought Sulgrave Manor and presented it to the peoples of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> to celebrate 100 years of continuing peace between them. Subsequently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Society of Colonial Dames of America</ENAMEX> endowed the house with the proceeds from an appeal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> that enlisted 35,000 subscribers and exceeded its target of $100,000 by an additional $12,000. Since then it has become a focal point for a small but persistent stream of visitors willing to make the huge leap of imagination needed to associate this peaceful spot with the whirlpool of today's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>.
The stained-glass panels in the window of the manor's Great Hall give them some help. They bear the arms of members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> family (again represented in the carved spandrels over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Porch</ENAMEX> doorway): three mullets (stars) and two bars (stripes). On the lawn flies the Star-Spangled Banner, and no one connected with the manor and its history believes this similarity in design is a coincidence. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Washington</ENAMEX> took his family crest with him when he left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> after having backed the wrong side in the Civil War.
It can be seen again in the little church of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. James</ENAMEX>-the-Less. Above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> Pew are four panels of Elizabethan glass, depicting the coats of arms of three generations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washingtons</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX>. Also here are the memorial brasses of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lawrence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amee</ENAMEX> and their four sons and seven daughters. To see them you must carefully roll up a slab of red carpet, protecting brasses now worn as thin as tissue paper. Behind the pew is a family tree, tracing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Washington</ENAMEX>'s line back to King <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> and the barons of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magna</ENAMEX> Charta. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colonial Dames</ENAMEX> have been active in the church too, presenting an organ in 1931. A further reminder of Anglo-American links is the tower screen, light oak picked out in blue and red, a gift of visitors from the States, beside which hang the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.
It is all very quiet and beautiful; golden marjoram bushes flame along the church path, and in the Deed Room at the manor daguerreotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX> look down on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Washington's</ENAMEX> inkstand, snippets of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Washington</ENAMEX>'s wedding dress and a ball gown, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s coat, his saddlebags and a shell button from the velvet coat in which he delivered his first presidential address. In addition there are a fine framed 19th-century Picture History of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, letters from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and other documents, as well as a square, squat and serviceable box: his liquor chest. Downstairs too there is a touching memorial. Installed by the Stars and Stripes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manchester</ENAMEX>, it is inscribed with the names of 112 American soldiers who died and were buried in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manchester</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great War</ENAMEX>.
But even in Sulgrave the 20th century has intruded. Not long ago thieves broke into the manor at night, planting their ladder in the exquisite herbaceous border and making off with 89 of the finer pieces from the collection. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rooms</ENAMEX> lovingly refurnished with fine period pieces now are missing clocks, chandeliers, chinoiserie, mirrors, a tea service and a set of early pewter plates. The carved Jacobean wooden wassail bowl that stood where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Washington</ENAMEX> once sat at table is gone, as is the famous Sulgrave clock. Fortunately the gilt frame of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert Stuart</ENAMEX> portrait of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> was being cleaned at the time, and the thieves did not bother with the unadorned canvas. But their haul was worth comfortably more than a million pounds (about $1.6 million).
The Director, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sirot Smith</ENAMEX>, is hopeful that at least some of the pieces will return: They all were catalogued and photographed and in 1972, after an earlier theft, the Sulgrave clock was returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX>. But many of the smaller pieces may well not come home to roost and will have to be replaced, a painstaking and expensive task.
Nor is this the only problem that confronts the manor. Although the Colonial Dames actively maintain their interest -- 160 of them come every two years to take tea on the lawn -- upkeep is a problem. The original endowment leaves the house underfunded, deathwatch beetle and woodworm have to be contended with, and the demands of conservation are continually on the increase. No help is forthcoming from either government, nor from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British National Trust</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sirot Smith</ENAMEX> has worked hard to improve the situation, notably with receptions this summer for members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and for firms with Anglo-American connections, celebrating the 200th anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s inauguration. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sirot Smith</ENAMEX>'s earlier experience as an educationalist also was brought into play in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, when the manor hosted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Histrionix</ENAMEX>, a history-reenactment society. Members lived in the house and grounds as they would have in the 18th century, including eating and sleeping
With such efforts and with the steady stream of paying visitors it is hoped that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sulgrave Manor</ENAMEX> will remain, to quote the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>'s opening speech: ``A shrine for all Americans who visit the old country and a centre from which sentiments of good will between the British and American peoples will ever radiate; these sentiments we believe to be the greatest security for the world's peace.''
About 15 miles from Sulgrave as the crow flies is Upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heyford</ENAMEX>, a USAF base with an F111 nuclear force. With luck the special relationship that started with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washingtons</ENAMEX> and that visibly flourished during President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s recent visit will survive to assist in rendering it obsolete.
