Americans are drinking less, but young professionals from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> are rushing to buy premium-brand American vodka, brandy and other spirits. In particular, many are snubbing the scotch preferred by their parents and opting for bourbon, the sweet firewater from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> countryside.
With <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> liquor consumption declining steadily, many American producers are stepping up their marketing efforts abroad. And those efforts are paying off: Spirits exports jumped more than 2 1/2 times to $157.2 million in 1988 from $59.8 million in 1983, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Distilled Spirits Council</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, a trade group.
``Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Bellas</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beverage Marketing Corp.</ENAMEX>, a research and consulting firm. ``If you want to be a player, you have to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>. You must have world-class brands, a long-term perspective and deep pockets.''
The internationalization of the industry has been hastened by foreign companies' acquisitions of many U.S. producers. In recent years, for example, Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heublein Inc.</ENAMEX>, while another British company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness PLC</ENAMEX>, took over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Distillers Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schenley Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>
But the shift has also been fueled by necessity. While premium-brand spirits like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smirnoff</ENAMEX> vodka and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Daniel</ENAMEX>'s whiskey are riding high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, domestic spirits consumption fell 15% to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979.
In recent years, growth has come in the foreign markets. U.S. brandy exports more than doubled last year to 360,000 proof gallons, a standard industry measure, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group</ENAMEX>, an industry association. Exports of rum surged 54% to 814,000 proof gallons. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> is the biggest importer of both rum and brandy from the U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, the world's third-largest liquor market after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, helped American companies in April when it lowered its tax on imported spirits and levied a tax on many domestic products. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> wineries, benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies, are expanding aggressively into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, the wineries are promoting their products' Pacific roots and courting restaurant and hotel chefs, whose recommendations carry weight.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown-Forman Corp.</ENAMEX> has increased its marketing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Comfort Liqueur.</ENAMEX> Using cinema, television and print ads, the company pitches Southern Comfort as a grand old drink of the antebellum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American South.</ENAMEX>
The biggest foreign inroads, though, have been made by bourbon. While U.S. makers of vodka, rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad, trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon. (All bourbon comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Daniel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste.) Moreover, just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries, a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore. How was the West won? With a six-shooter in one hand and bourbon in the other.
``We imagine with bourbon the Wild <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, Western motion pictures and gunmen appearing,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenji Kishimoto</ENAMEX>, vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suntory International Corp.</ENAMEX>, a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suntory Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s largest liquor company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suntory</ENAMEX> distributes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown-Forman bourbons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
Bourbon makes up just 1% of world-wide spirits consumption, but it represented 57% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> liquor exports last year, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobson</ENAMEX>; no other category had more than 19%. Big U.S. distillers are fiercely vying for this market, which grew to $77 million last year from $33 million in 1987, according to government figures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim Beam Brands Co.</ENAMEX>, a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Brands Inc.</ENAMEX>, is the leading exporter of bourbon and produces 10 other types of liquor. The company says it will increase its international advertising 35% in 1990, with bourbon representing most of that amount.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schenley Industries</ENAMEX> unit has increased its TV advertising in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, enabling it to install prominent counter displays. The company's I.W. Harper brand is the leading bourbon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, with 40% of the market.
Bourbon exporters have succeeded in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> where other industries have failed, avoiding cultural hitches in marketing and distribution by allying themselves with local agents. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim Beam Brands</ENAMEX> has a distribution partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikka Whiskey Co.</ENAMEX>, a distiller. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram Co.</ENAMEX>, which exports Four Roses bourbon, has such a link with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirin Brewery Co.</ENAMEX>
Some bourbon makers advertise abroad as they do at home. To promote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Daniel</ENAMEX>'s overseas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown-Forman</ENAMEX> uses the same photos of front porches from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lynchburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, and avuncular old men in overalls and hightops.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beam</ENAMEX> print ads, however, strike different chords in different countries. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, land of the outback, a snapshot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beam</ENAMEX> lies on a strip of hand-tooled leather. West Germans get glitz, with bourbon in the foreground and a posh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> hotel in the background. Ads for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> are artsy and irreverent. One ad features a huge robot carrying a voluptuous woman in a faint. The tagline: ``I only asked if she wanted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beam</ENAMEX>.
