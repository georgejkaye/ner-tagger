<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New American Shoe Co.</ENAMEX> filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
The petition was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plainview</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, company has manufacturing facilities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New American Shoe</ENAMEX>, a maker of discount casual and athletic shoes, was established in April 1988 under a plan of reorganization filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amfesco Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>, a predecessor company that had a similar Chapter 11 proceeding, under which a company continues operations while working out a plan to pay debt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pollack</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New American</ENAMEX>, said the company couldn't overcome the $21 million debt burden inherited from its predecessor.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New American</ENAMEX> Shoe listed assets of $17 million and liabilities of $48 million, he said. The largest creditors are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Banking Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irving Trust Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Pacific Business Credit Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contitrade Financial Services</ENAMEX>. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> is a fully secured creditor, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pollack</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pollack</ENAMEX> said the company had negotiated since February with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irving Trust</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banco Popular</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, which collectively hold 30% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New American</ENAMEX>'s stock, to reduce the debt burden to a level that could attract investors. Those negotiations proved unsuccessful, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pollack</ENAMEX> said.
Under the 1988 reorganization plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert B. Campbell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New American Shoe's</ENAMEX> chairman, owned 55% of the company, while the three banks owned 30% and shareholders the rest. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s $20 million investment in the company had partly funded the reorganization plan.
In a news release, the company said it had experienced severe financial problems almost from its inception. Negotiations with potential investors and financial institutions about obtaining additional funding have been unsuccessful but are continuing, the release stated.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New American Shoe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> government has expressed interest in keeping the company's factories there operating, and has arranged for private and government financial institutions to discuss local investment possiblities with the company.
