A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by 18 states alleging that numerous big insurance companies conspired to control the insurance market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Van de Kamp</ENAMEX>, whose office is heading up the states' case, immediately vowed to appeal and to keep appealing all the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, if necessary.
Neither the dismissal nor the promised appeal are a surprise. In his preliminary opinion circulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William W. Schwarzer</ENAMEX> had said that, even if the companies colluded to drive up insurance rates, the companies were probably protected from any liability by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccarran-Ferguson</ENAMEX> Act of 1944. That act grants the insurance industry broad exemptions from antitrust laws.
The suit's primary targets included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Casualty & Surety</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allstate Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartford Fire Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. Basically, the states alleged that through threats and other coercive tactics beginning in late 1984, the companies illegally conspired to deny certain kinds of coverage for such things as pollution damage. Insurance rates skyrocketed and many communities were hurt because they had to pay much higher premiums for far less coverage.
In his final ruling, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwarzer</ENAMEX> said that, though the insurance companies' conduct ``may well state a claim for relief'' under antitrust laws in any other industries, the insurance industry's antitrust exemptions made it immune from liability in this case.
