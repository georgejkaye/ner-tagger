Investors dumped technology shares and ran for cover to stocks of companies with stable earnings, driving certain sectors of the market sharply higher.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average rose 21.85 to 2694.91, the largest gain since Aug. 24, when the average broke its all-time record in a 56.53-point rally. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume rose to 164,240,000 shares, the highest in more than two weeks.
Despite the rally and the rise in volume, traders said investors didn't trade a broad range of stocks. Special situations -- technology, airlines, waste management companies and consumer goods -- dominated trading.
``It's a market that has all kinds of cross-currents,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John B. Burke</ENAMEX>, a veteran floor trader on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. ``The dollar, capital gains, interest rates, technology stocks -- these are the underpinnings of the market. But the whole thing is awash in conflicting aspects.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> topped the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>'s most active list, falling 2 1/2 to 109 on nearly four million shares. Wednesday, the computer giant said profit for the third quarter and the year will be below analysts' expectations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s announcement caused a flight to stocks of companies with sound earnings prospects, especially because today is the last trading day of the quarter, and money managers show clients what they own. Drug stocks gained in the run for big, stable companies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> added 2 1/4 to 76 1/4. The company announced a marketing and research pact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer</ENAMEX> rose 1 to 68 3/8, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbott Labs</ENAMEX> gained 1 7/8 to 64.
Consumer stocks also rose in the flight to safety. Three are in the Dow industrial average: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX>, which gained 4 1/2 to 165; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>, which added 3 1/2 to 120 3/4, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX>, which climbed 2 7/8 to 67 1/2.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> stock, climbed 1 1/4 to a 52-week high of 43 7/8 on volume of 1.9 million shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>, the owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, soared 4 3/4 to 83 3/4 on 2.1 million shares on various takeover rumors, including talk about a possible joint proposal from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>'s management, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American's</ENAMEX> unions and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bass</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. Traders also said there were rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> were buying stock in the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> was cited as a heavy buyer of the stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> declined comment on the rumors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX>, which reached a preliminary agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World</ENAMEX> airlines for a joint computer reservation system, gained 1 1/8 to 71 3/8. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Transportation Average</ENAMEX> rose 10.49 to 1438.12.
Some brokerage stocks slipped. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> dropped 1/2 to 30 1/4 as institutional accounts sold the stock in expectation that third-quarter earnings might be disappointing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the activity of its stock.
Elsewhere in the computer sector, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment</ENAMEX> lost 1 3/4 to 91 7/8, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer</ENAMEX> tumbled 1 3/4 to 86 1/2, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> dropped 7/8 to 50 3/8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cray Research</ENAMEX> retreated 1 3/4 to 40 3/4.

As for food and beverage issues, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borden</ENAMEX> rose 2 1/4 to 36 3/4 after announcing plans for a major restructuring, including the closing or sale of about 25% of its plants and a cutback of about 15% in its work force.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX> gained 1 3/8 to 59, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> surged 3 to 73 1/2, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> climbed 2 1/8 to 70 1/2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conagra</ENAMEX> added 1 3/8 to 39.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bristol-Myers</ENAMEX> gained 1 to 52 3/8 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite trading of 1.8 million shares. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approved plans for expanded distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDI</ENAMEX>, the company's experimental AIDS drug. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb</ENAMEX>, which plans to merge with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bristol Myers</ENAMEX>, rose 3 1/8 to 125 3/8.
Other drug stocks besides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> to attract buyers included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli Lilly</ENAMEX>, which went up 1 3/4 to 62 3/8; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner-Lambert</ENAMEX>, up 3 1/4 to 110 1/2; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products</ENAMEX>, up 1 1/2 to 100 1/2, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX>, up 1/4 to 38 1/4.
Issues of footwear companies were especially active. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A. Gear</ENAMEX> fell 1 7/8 to 43 1/4 on two million shares as investors took profits after the company reported earnings for the quarter ended in August, which met analysts' estimates. But its two major competitors both rallied on heavy volume; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok International</ENAMEX> jumped 1 7/8 to 18 1/4 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> dealings, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX> rose 2 3/8 to 68 in over-the-counter trading.

The search for companies with the potential for earnings growth also sent investors to the big-city bank sector, due partly to optimism that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Argentina</ENAMEX> may resume payments on its debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> added 1 1/2 to 34, J.P. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> gained 1 1/4 to 44, Chase <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> rose 2 3/8 to 43, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Banking</ENAMEX> advanced 1 1/4 to 39 7/8 and Bankers Trust <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> rose 2 to 53 5/8.
