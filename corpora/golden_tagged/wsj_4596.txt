Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Dyson</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>) is returning $18,000 in campaign donations, gathered for him in 1987 by executives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys Corp.</ENAMEX>, because of suspicion they were illegal.
The congressman, a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX>, returned another $1,000 Unisys gift earlier this year after the donor admitted as part of a guilty plea that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> contractor had reimbursed him for the gift from corporate funds in violation of federal law.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dyson</ENAMEX> said some of the contributors of the $18,000, all connected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX>, have pleaded guilty to making illegal donations to other congressional campaigns. ``We are not alleging that the contributions were made illegally,'' he said. ``I am making a personal decision, however, that the funds be returned out of an abundance of caution.''
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dyson</ENAMEX>, who announced he is running for re-election, also said a former administrative aide improperly diverted $7,275 in campaign funds for the aide's personal use. The congressman said he expects his campaign committee will pay a fine to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Election Commission</ENAMEX> as a result. The aide committed suicide last year.
