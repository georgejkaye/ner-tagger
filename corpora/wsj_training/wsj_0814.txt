In search of buyers for upscale department-store chains such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>, investment bankers are turning to -- who else? The Japanese. But so far <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s cash-rich retailers are proving to be cautious shoppers.
``We have the money to buy. But operating a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> department-store chain would be very difficult,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motoyuki Homma</ENAMEX>, managing director of the international division at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi Ltd.</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s leading department stores.
Japanese retail executives say the main reason they are reluctant to jump into the fray in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is that -- unlike manufacturing -- retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles. The Japanese have watched the Europeans and Canadians stumble in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market, and they fret that business practices that have won them huge profits at home won't translate into success in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Japanese department stores are also wary of attracting negative publicity. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>'s recent headline-grabbing acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX>, many say it makes good political sense to lie low. ``It's a question of timing,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayumi Takayama</ENAMEX>, managing director of international operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isetan Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> department store.
Still, for those with a long-term eye on the vast U.S. retail market, this is a tempting time to look for bargains. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> is trying to unwind its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing operations, which include such well-known stores as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breuners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivey</ENAMEX>'s. And debt-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> is giving up the 17-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s group.
``Every department store in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is taking a look,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Allen</ENAMEX>, a retail analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclay's</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan) Ltd.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>, however, doesn't think that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is about to embark on a major buying binge.
Nonetheless, speculation heated up yesterday when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyu Department Store Co.</ENAMEX> confirmed a report in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nihon Keizai Shimbun</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s leading business daily, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyu</ENAMEX> is talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> about buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyu</ENAMEX>, however, said no agreement had been reached.
Nor is Tokyu the only Japanese retailer interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, which bankers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> estimate could cost between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. Seven Japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Traub</ENAMEX>, and more than half are seeking additional information on the group, bankers say.
What Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> is hoping to put together, investment bankers say, is a management-led group to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> department-store group that he heads from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores</ENAMEX> subsidiary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired last year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction. Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and its stores that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s.
Hoping to avoid another takeover, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> retained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> to help him find partners for a management-led buy-out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ideally</ENAMEX>, investment bankers say, he wants to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store to forge a global retailing network. ``When you look at the economics, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> needs a Japanese and a European partner to make it work,'' says one investment banker who follows the retail industry. ``Looking only at a narrow American strategy isn't where it's at.''
Persuading tradition-bound Japanese retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing industry isn't likely to be so easy, analysts say. Up until now, most stores have followed the same basic overseas strategy: First they set up overseas merchandising offices to import items and track new fashion trends. Then they opened small gift shops mostly aimed at Japanese tourists.
Reluctant to advance further on their own, some stores have settled for tie-ups with famous specialty shops. Last March, Isetan invested 1.5 billion yen ($10.6 million) in a venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barney's Inc.</ENAMEX>, an up-scale <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> specialty clothier. The first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barney</ENAMEX>'s shop is scheduled to open in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> next year.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> recently increased its equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany & Co.</ENAMEX> to 13%. Through the longstanding relationship between the two companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> has opened 22 Tiffany shops in its stores and arcades in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. Plans are under way to open a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany's</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> to cater to Japanese tourists; it will be run mostly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX>.
Some industry observers say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX>'s classy image makes it a possible match for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Company</ENAMEX> officials say they are studying various proposals but won't discuss details.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takashimaya Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s oldest department store, is another name that keeps popping up as a potential fit with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eiji Nakazato</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takashimaya</ENAMEX> general manager, admits that his company's image is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX>'s and that there is some interest in the idea. But he stops there. ``We'd like to do business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>,'' he says. ``But it looks tough.''

The Vatican was in the red last year.
It said the regular 1988 deficit amounted to $43.5 million, based on revenue of $74.4 million and expenses of $117.9 million. But it said extraordinary expenditures for its radio station and restoration of buildings increased the deficit to $57.2 million.
A statement from the council of cardinals said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catholics</ENAMEX> had responded generously to an appeal last year to give more money after 1987's record $63 million deficit. The statement said a 5% jump in the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>'s Pence'' collection -- the annual offering from Catholics to the pope -- helped cover the deficit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> member Cardinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Carter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican Radio</ENAMEX>: ``Now that we say we covered our deficit this year, people are going to relax and say well that's fine, the Holy See is out of the hole. But we're... going to be in the exact same situation next year.''
Former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> is to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> at the invitation of the government beginning Saturday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> announced. According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s office, ``This is solely a fact-finding trip. There will be no sightseeing, no shopping and no social events.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s office said the former president ``expects to have one-on-one discussions with the major Chinese leaders'' and will give his assessment of those leaders to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> upon his return.
A poll conducted in 12 of 16 NATO countries shows that the Dutch appear to be the strongest supporters of the alliance. The poll, conducted for the Dutch daily De Telegraaf by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup International</ENAMEX> said 81% of Dutch people supported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> was the second most pro-NATO country with 78% supporting the alliance, followed by the U.S. with 75%, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> with 71%, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> with 69% and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> with 63%. All other countries registered support below 50%.
The Israeli <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers' Association</ENAMEX> filed a police complaint against an Arab pasta maker for using the four colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag on spaghetti packages. ``We asked police to investigate why they are allowed to distribute the flag in this way. It should be considered against the law,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Leish</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the association. The spaghetti is made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al Ghazel Macaroni Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bethlehem</ENAMEX> and is marketed in a package decorated with green, black, red and white stripes.
British postal authorities say they have uncovered a large-scale scheme where unscrupulous stamp dealers chemically removed stamp cancellations, regummed the stamps and sold them to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> collectors or, in large lots, to British businesses. The scheme allegedly cost the post office # 10 million ($16.1) in revenue in the past 12 months. Dealers bought the used stamps cheaply from charities, including the Guide Dogs for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blind Association</ENAMEX>. The charities regularly sell used stamps, which they collect from children and other donors, to raise funds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akio Tanii</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ENAMEX>, presented the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> consul general in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Osaka</ENAMEX> with a $1 million check to help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s earthquake victims. The company's U.S. subsidiary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, had donated over $35,000 worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita</ENAMEX>-made flashlights and batteries to residents shortly after the disaster, a company spokesman said. Several other Japanese companies and regional governments have sent aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumitomo Bank</ENAMEX> donated $500,000, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> prefecture $15,000 and the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Osaka</ENAMEX> $10,000.
Chinese officials are trying to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canton Trade Fair</ENAMEX> to lure back overseas traders after the bloody crackdown on dissent. But attendance is down from previous years.
What's more, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> textile trader says, some Chinese exporters from state-run enterprises are protesting the crackdown by dragging their feet on soliciting new business. ``They are angry about the government... so they hold back the goods,'' he said.
This autumn's edition of the biannual fair will run through Oct. 31. Inside the 156,000-square-yard glass exhibition complex, products ranging from clothing to AK-47 machine guns are on display.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair</ENAMEX> officials say that 21,000 guests visited during the first five days, a 10% drop from the spring exhibition. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s official Xinhua <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Agency</ENAMEX> reported that the number of foreign businessmen was greater than the previous fair -- without providing statistics.
In another sign of glasnost, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</ENAMEX>'s long-banned chronicle of Soviet repression, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulag Archipelago</ENAMEX>,'' is now recommended reading in one 11th-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> history class.... British customs officers said they'd arrested eight men sneaking 111 rare snakes into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> -- including one man who strapped a pair of boa constrictors under his armpits. A customs official said the arrests followed a ``Snake Day'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utrecht University</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, an event used by some collectors as an opportunity to obtain rare snakes.
