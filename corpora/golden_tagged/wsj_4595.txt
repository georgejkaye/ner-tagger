Investors filed lawsuits against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Trading Group Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel Trading Co.</ENAMEX>, charging the options brokerage firms with engaging in fraudulent and abusive sales practices.
The suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX>, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mateo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, was filed in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>; the other was filed in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel</ENAMEX> is based. Both complaints seek class-action status.
The civil litigation is the first to follow two lawsuits filed earlier this month by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> regulators' suits, the latest complaints allege, among other things, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel</ENAMEX> misrepresented to clients the potential for making large profits in commodity futures options, and didn't adequately outline the associated risks. The suits both also seek undetermined damages, to be trebled under federal racketeering statutes.
Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>'s action, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> fined Siegel $100,000 and ordered it to withdraw permanently from exchange membership. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> said in part that Siegel ``favored its own rather than customers' best interests'' by making trades in their accounts without customer approval. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel</ENAMEX> agreed to the fine and withdrawal of membership without admitting or denying the exchange's allegations.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel</ENAMEX> official referred calls seeking comment to the company's attorney, who couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Trading Group</ENAMEX> attorney declined to comment, saying he hadn't seen the lawsuits.
