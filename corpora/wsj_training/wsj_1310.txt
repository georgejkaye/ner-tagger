A federal judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> has entered a judgment requiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> organized crime figure to pay the government $250,000, representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Brotherhood of Teamsters</ENAMEX>.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Obermaier</ENAMEX> said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Lombardo</ENAMEX>, who the government alleged was the ``captain'' of organized crime in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, was one of numerous defendants in the government's sweeping racketeering suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teamsters</ENAMEX>. In the suit, filed in June 1988, the government accused the union's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering. Among other things, the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union's top officials.
U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Edelstein</ENAMEX> also permanently enjoined Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombardo</ENAMEX> from any future dealings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teamsters</ENAMEX> or any other labor union.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lombardo</ENAMEX>, the last of the defendants to settle the suit, agreed to pay the government the $250,000 within one week.
