<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway Corp.</ENAMEX> has paid the Canadian government $45 million Canadian (US$38 million) to settle a decade-old customs dispute.
The out-of-court settlement amounts to 40% of the Canadian government's C$113 million claim against the direct sales company for duties and penalties owed as a result of customs evasion in the 1970s.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to defrauding Canadian customs in a separate 1983 criminal prosecution. But the government had to undertake a civil action to collect the duties and penalties that the government claimed were owed.
The government decided to accept the out-of-court settlement to save the time and expense of a civil action that could have dragged on indefinitely, said a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revenue Canada</ENAMEX>, the federal revenue department.
Government officials also said they weren't certain that even if the claim were upheld by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Court</ENAMEX> that they would be able to collect the full amount. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX> officials had said the company's ``maximum exposure'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, based on the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX>'s Canadian properties, was C$6 million.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway's</ENAMEX> headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, a spokeswoman said the company is ``pleased'' with the settlement. She said that under the arrangement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX> is prohibited from commenting on the settlement's terms and conditions.
The case has been a public-relations, as well as a financial, headache for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amway</ENAMEX> made a short-lived bid in May for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Products Inc.</ENAMEX>, opponents of the offer cited the Canadian dispute in efforts to discredit the company.
The settlement was the largest ever made in a Canadian customs case, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revenue Canada</ENAMEX> official said. The Canadian government spokesman said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amway</ENAMEX> made the C$45 million payment Sept. 15.
In the 1983 criminal action against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amway</ENAMEX>, the company paid a C$25 million fine after pleading guilty to defrauding the government by declaring false values for goods imported into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> over 15 years.
When the out-of-court settlement was reached in the civil action, the case was still in its pre-trial examination for discovery stage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX> had fought, mostly unsuccessfully through the courts, to prevent having to provide various documents and witnesses to the pre-trial hearing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX> officials said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amway</ENAMEX> made the proposal for the settlement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX>, founded in 1959, is owned by the families of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Van Andel</ENAMEX>, chairman, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Devos</ENAMEX>, president. For the year ended Aug. 31, sales were about US$1.9 billion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX> doesn't disclose earnings.
