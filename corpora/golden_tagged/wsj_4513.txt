Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nott</ENAMEX> will retire as chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers & Co.</ENAMEX> at year end, handing the reins to Michel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David-Weill</ENAMEX>, who will become the first person to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard group</ENAMEX>'s British, French and U.S. operations concurrently.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David-Weill</ENAMEX> already exercises effective voting control over half the equity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers</ENAMEX>, the investment-banking group's British operation, according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard</ENAMEX> official. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson PLC</ENAMEX>, the British media group, owns the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David-Weill</ENAMEX> also is senior partner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard group</ENAMEX>'s French and U.S. arms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Cie.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX> The three Lazard firms are linked through complicated cross-shareholdings.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David-Weill</ENAMEX>, 56, will become chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Verey</ENAMEX>, 38, a rising star in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers</ENAMEX>' mergers-and-acquisitions department, will move up to chief executive from deputy chief executive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Agius</ENAMEX>, 43, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nelson</ENAMEX>, 42, both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based managing directors, will become vice chairmen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers</ENAMEX>.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, a 57-year-old former British defense secretary who has headed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers</ENAMEX> for five years, initiated his own departure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard</ENAMEX> officials said. ``His record has always been spending five years at something and then moving on,'' said a colleague. ``He feels now it's time to move on.'' Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> didn't return phone calls yesterday.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David-Weill</ENAMEX> said Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John ``</ENAMEX>indicated he had done what he set out to do, and now he wants to do something else.''
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> helped steer Lazard away from the pitfalls encountered by many competitors that acquired British securities-trading and sales operations prior to the deregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s financial markets in 1986. Instead, he focused on boosting fee-producing operations like mergers-advisory services. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers</ENAMEX> ranked eighth among British bid advisers in the first half, up from 11th a year earlier. Combined with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres operations</ENAMEX>, it would have ranked third. One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers</ENAMEX> client is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verey</ENAMEX> helped mastermind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s current restructuring plan, aimed at defeating a # 13.35 billion ($21.62 billion) bid from Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David-Weill</ENAMEX>, who represents the fourth generation of a French banking family, said in an interview from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> that his assumption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Brothers</ENAMEX> chairmanship reflected the increasing ``globalization of industrial thinking'' that is bringing the world's financial and business markets closer.
``Our clients want to have the advantage of speaking to two and sometimes the three firms combined. Having a {single} chairman will make that easier,'' he said. The three firms, he added, ``have difficult sorting-out to do, all the time. If it is done for a time with one single voice, the sorting-out will be very easy.''
What Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> will do next isn't clear. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David-Weill</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard</ENAMEX> directors said Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> hasn't told them what he plans, though some speculate he may be appointed chairman of a major British company, or perhaps re-enter politics.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energetic</ENAMEX>, outspoken and at times impatient, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> entered British politics in the mid-1960s after training as a lawyer and investment banker. He rose to become defense secretary during the Falklands War, only to quit in 1983 in a dispute over the future course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> administration.
