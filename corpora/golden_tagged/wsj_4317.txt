An early scene in the hot new film ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> and Me'' shows a water tower being demolished at an empty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> factory in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX> The scene symbolizes the movie's message: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> abandoned and destroyed the town of its birth, committing corporate matricide.
But in fact the scene is one of rebirth as well as death. The water tower was part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> factory complex that's been gutted and converted into a new high-tech engineering center. Next week, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> executives will travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> to dedicate the center, which will house 1,500 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> engineers. About half of them are being transferred into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> from elsewhere.
So the water tower scene really symbolizes the fundamental flaw with ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> and Me.'' Yes, the movie is full of wonderfully clever and caustic comedy that's winning rave reviews from the sort of critics to whom film is a two-syllable word. But it paints a picture of despair at a time when there's finally some reason for optimism, however guarded, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> and factory towns like it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s record is far from perfect, but the company is hardly the Monster that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ate Flint</ENAMEX>.
The ``Roger'' in ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> and Me'' is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger B. Smith</ENAMEX>, the controversy-prone chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> ``Me'' refers to the film's creator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Moore</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> native and former editor of a counter-culture newspaper and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Jones magazine</ENAMEX>, the 35-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> also stars in this, his first film. He pops up time and again, trying to confront Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and invite him to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> to witness the city's woes first-hand. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> carries his search to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> headquarters, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> Athletic Club and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grosse Pointe Yacht Club</ENAMEX>. The last quest was bound to be futile, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detroiters</ENAMEX> will know, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grosse</ENAMEX> Pointe is Ford country. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> actually hangs out across town at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bloomfield Hills</ENAMEX> Country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX>, but that club isn't as photogenic.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> and Me'' played two sellout showings at the 27th <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Film <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Festival</ENAMEX> this week, and the film lives up to its dark comedy billing. It's hard to know whether to laugh at or cry about the impoverished woman who raises rabbits to sell as pets or as meat. She slaughters and dresses the bunnies herself, but later concludes she wants to be a veterinarian.
The atmosphere at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Center</ENAMEX> after Wednesday's debut was as darkly comic as the film itself. One fan asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> whether his film had ``radicalized'' the workers back home. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart Mott</ENAMEX>, left-wing activist heir to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> fortune, strode to the stage in khaki clothes and a fishing vest to declare his affection for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>. Later, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mott</ENAMEX> hugged the young film maker, who explained that the film functioned as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mott</ENAMEX>'s ``own personal release'' (presumably from guilt).
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX>, some 60 miles north of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>, is home to 150,000 souls. In 1978 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> employed 72,000 people there, making Flint the consummate company town. That's what <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> still is, even though the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> employees has fallen to about 45,000.
What happened is no secret. A haughty, complacent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> got hit with the cold new reality of international competition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> -- like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> and other industrial giants -- bears plenty of blame for letting itself get so bloated that it had to discard workers like excess baggage from a sinking ship.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> compounded its troubles with hare-brained civic schemes: a downtown luxury hotel to promote tourism, of all things, an indoor ``theme park'' called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Autoworld</ENAMEX> and a downtown shopping complex. The city fathers paid television evangelist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Schuller</ENAMEX> $20,000 to come to town and pronounce: ``Tough times don't last, tough people do.''
In 1984 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s big Buick assembly plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX> was scheduled for extinction. But the man in charge, a vice president named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Reuss</ENAMEX>, persuaded the company to invest $350 million to transform the factory into a cutting-edge body-and-assembly complex called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick City</ENAMEX>. It was a ``bet your career'' move and it looked to be a losing bet at first.
The workers couldn't handle the robots, the robots couldn't work with each other, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick City</ENAMEX>'s launch in 1985 was a disaster. By the time the plant was debugged, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s sales were so low that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick City</ENAMEX> needed just one shift of workers. The second shift was laid off in October 1987. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> chose a new president in May 1987, it wasn't Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuss</ENAMEX>.
But then a funny thing happened. ``Union and management both realized that they had to work together like heck to pull themselves out of the mess they were in,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis B. Campbell</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> vice president who now runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick City</ENAMEX>. Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Yaklin</ENAMEX>, president of the local union, ``Finally, management is letting our people use their minds as well as their hands.''
Last March, the plant's second shift was recalled. In June, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> Lesabre, built at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick City</ENAMEX>, was rated the second highest quality car in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> -- foreign or domestic -- by the respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.D. Power</ENAMEX> independent survey. Lesabre sales have surged, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick City</ENAMEX> is now working overtime. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, has moved his family out of an exclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> suburb and into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flint</ENAMEX>, and his children attend Catholic schools in the city. In 1987 Flint voters, fed up with civic boondoggles, elected a 29-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Point</ENAMEX> graduate as mayor. Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Collier</ENAMEX>, now a ripe old 31, has balanced the budget and reduced crime. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX> may be a social radical, but now he's about to become a rich entrepreneur. He sold his house, went into debt and held weekly bingo games to finance ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX> and Me.'' He's entertaining bids for distribution rights to the film, and expects to land $1 million or more.
In short, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>, whose talent is undeniable, is a great American success story. Just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flint</ENAMEX> once was, and, like so many other factory towns across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, is struggling to become again.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingrassia</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX>'s bureau chief in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>.
