<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Bancorp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, said it will apply additional funds to its reserve for taxes after settling disputes with authorities, which will result in a net charge of $3.2 million against third-quarter earnings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore H. Silbert</ENAMEX>, chairman, wouldn't disclose the amount of its settlement, the company's level of tax reserves or changes in reserves. He said the company remains ``moderately profitable.''
The bank holding company of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling National Bank & Trust Co.</ENAMEX> said it settled disputes with federal, state and city governments for 1977 through 1981, citing expenses of fighting such government claims. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silbert</ENAMEX> attributed the disputes principally to the compounding of interest and divestiture of non-banking subsidiaries prior to 1979.
In the first six months, the company had a loss of $1.99 million, resulting from the ``high prevailing costs'' of some short-term debt it was servicing.
Sterling also increased its board membership to 14 and elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lillian Berkman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene T. Rossides</ENAMEX> as directors.
