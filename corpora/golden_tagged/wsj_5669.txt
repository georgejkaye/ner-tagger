<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> said it plans to build a magnetic-tape-coating plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>.
Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, said the new facility will be established in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dax</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontonx</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> at a cost of 500 million francs ($75.4 million).
The plant will make coated-magnetic tapes to be supplied to the three tape-product plants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> maintains in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> -- two in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Construction</ENAMEX> will start early in 1990, with production scheduled to get under way in the spring of 1991. The new plant will employ about 100 people.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western European</ENAMEX> plants have acquired tape material from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> But because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s rapid expansion in the magnetic-tape markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, production has reached a scale that justifies the establishment of a coating facility there, officials say.
