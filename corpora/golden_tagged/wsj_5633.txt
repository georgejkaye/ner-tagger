Investors looked for leadership in the market but found none.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average eased 0.19 to 2687.31, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s 500-stock index edged down 0.18 to 346.55. Volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> picked up only slightly to 141,610,000 shares from Monday's 136,940,000.
Trading was thin enough that a brief spurt of computer-driven program selling near the close wiped out the day's gains in a matter of minutes.
Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> announced a funding agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York</ENAMEX> yesterday, traders said many investors remain concerned about the future of leveraged buy-outs because of the cash squeeze at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based retailer, a major junk-bond issuer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consequently</ENAMEX>, some flight-to-quality buying was seen in big, well-known stocks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX> rose 1/2 to a new high of 42, for example, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> rose 2 1/4 to 158 5/8.
Meanwhile, undaunted speculators traded a number of rumor-driven or ``whisper'' stocks back up again. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotels</ENAMEX>, currently entertaining acquisition offers, rose 2 to 101 1/4. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, rose 3/4 to 76 1/2.
``What you are seeing is an attempt to restore confidence after they knocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humpty Dumpty</ENAMEX> off the wall last week,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Solomon</ENAMEX>, technical analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>.
Outside of the takeover arena, however, investors sat, wondered and barely traded.
``There is no market leadership to speak of,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Grohowski</ENAMEX>, director of equity portfolio management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marinvest</ENAMEX>. ``Where are the values? In cyclical stocks, we are still worried about the possibility of a recession. And consumer stocks still look expensive. It is difficult to find compelling stories'' to trade on, he said.
Money managers appeared to shrug at yesterday's consumer price report for August. Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, consumer prices rose 0.2%. Because prices will probably rise in the next few months, many analysts concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> won't lower interest rates anytime soon. But that conclusion didn't seem to prompt any response from the money managers.
``There is an attitude of non-interest, and it has been a little puzzling,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Puccio</ENAMEX>, managing director in charge of equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX>, which shot to a 52-week high Monday, fell 1 5/8 on profit-taking to 113 7/8. The company announced a 3-for-1 stock split and an increase in its quarterly dividend, pending regulatory approval.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> halted trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> at 11:33 a.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EDT</ENAMEX>, shortly after the company informed the exchange of the stock split. The exchange doesn't usually halt trading on stock split announcements. But exchange officials were concerned that investors might not initially understand that the company's actions are subject to approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.C. Holdings</ENAMEX> was the largest loser on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> in percentage terms, dropping 1/2 to 2 1/8 after yesterday's Wall Street Journal quoted an analyst as saying that the highly leveraged company is close to defaulting on its junk bonds and might declare bankruptcy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Products</ENAMEX> was the most active stock, slipping 2 1/8 to 31 3/4 on volume of 2.2 million shares.
The company cut its earnings estimate for the full year as a result of softening sales trends in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and a stronger-than-expected dollar abroad. Earnings for 1989 now are projected at $1.95 to $2.15 a share, compared with earlier estimates of $2.30 to $2.40 a share.
Also on the most active list, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara Mohawk Power</ENAMEX> gained 5/8 to 14. An article in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barron</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX> said the utility hopes to return the No. 1 Unit of its Nine Mile Point nuclear facility to full power soon. The unit has been idle for nearly two years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ames Department Stores</ENAMEX> lost 7/8 to 16 5/8. A 1.2 million-share block was traded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> in the afternoon. The company said it is planning to issue $100 million of convertible debentures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> gained 2 1/4 to 44. Trading in the stock was halted late Monday when the banking concern announced a series of moves to improve its capital position, including the $1.28 billion sale of a 60% stake in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT Group</ENAMEX> unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank</ENAMEX>. The Japanese bank also will pay $120 million for a 4.9% equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster Entertainment</ENAMEX> gained 1 to 16 after it agreed to sell one million of its shares to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Cable</ENAMEX> for $15 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank System</ENAMEX> lost 1 3/4 to 21 1/8. The stock slid 1 1/8 Monday after it said it would take a charge of $25 million to $40 million against third-quarter earnings to raise its loan-loss provision.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian Associates</ENAMEX> fell 1 1/4 to 25 3/4. The company said it expects to report fourth-quarter net income lower than the 45 cents a share it reported for its third quarter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus</ENAMEX> gained 1 1/8 to 34 1/2. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> said the company agreed to sell the credit card operation of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dreyfus Consumer Bank</ENAMEX> to a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> for $168 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> eased 1/4 to 49 5/8.
Dayton <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> gained 1 3/8 to 61 3/8. The company is offering to buy back seven million of its 7.7 million common shares outstanding for between $60 and $65 a share.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> closed unchanged at 36 3/8 on volume of 1.1 million shares. The company boosted its quarterly dividend by three cents to 25 cents a share. Separately, the company's president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.C. Hoff</ENAMEX>, said he will retire at the end of the year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner-Lambert</ENAMEX> gained 2 1/4 to 106 1/2. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney Harris Upham</ENAMEX> raised its recommendation on the stock to ``trading buy'' from ``hold ,'' according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Professional Investor Report.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee</ENAMEX> dropped 1 1/8 to 49 3/8 after gaining 2 1/2 points Monday. The company's 84-year-old co-founder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean A. Mcgee</ENAMEX>, died Friday.
