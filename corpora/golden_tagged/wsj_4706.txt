A grand jury agreed to investigate last Wednesday's crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair Group Inc.</ENAMEX> jetliner at the request of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, District Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Santucci</ENAMEX>.
The plane, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, crashed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Guardia Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queens</ENAMEX> killing two of 63 passengers.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santucci</ENAMEX>'s decision to present the inquiry to the grand jury is unusual and could lead to criminal charges against the pilots.
The grand-jury investigation threatens to undermine future airline-crash inquiries, warns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airline Pilots Association</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Duffy</ENAMEX>. ``Never has anyone talked about criminal penalties in airline safety before,'' he said.
It is unusual, perhaps unheard of, for local authorities to conduct a criminal investigation into an airline crash, most observers agree. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duffy</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santucci</ENAMEX>'s actions set a far-reaching and disturbing precedent. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duffy</ENAMEX> contends that airline and airport personnel, fearful that they might be indicted, will be reluctant to cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation and Saftey Board</ENAMEX> inquiries. That lack of cooperation will delay the airline industry's, the union's and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>'s joint effort to find out what went wrong and correct the error, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duffy</ENAMEX> said.
``What we got here is a grandstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.A.</ENAMEX> who is into an area he knows nothing about,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duffy</ENAMEX> said.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> spokesman says he doubts Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santucci</ENAMEX>'s criminal investigation undermines the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>'s efforts. The spokesman pointed out that last May charges of criminal recklessness were brought against the ship captain of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> Valdez by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaskan</ENAMEX> authorities when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> tanker ran aground and spilled 10.9 million gallons of oil into the Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sound</ENAMEX>.
``We have seen criminal investigations conducted by local authorities at the same time as ours before,'' he said.
A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queens</ENAMEX> district attorney said no specific targets have been named and no charges have been brought in the investigation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Guardia</ENAMEX> crash.
The grand-jury investigations could lead to the indictment of Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Martin</ENAMEX>, and co-pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Constantine</ENAMEX> Kleissas on reckless-endangerment or negligent-homicide charges.
The pilots' lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick P. Hafetz</ENAMEX>, contends Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Santucci</ENAMEX> has ``no basis for any criminal investigation.
