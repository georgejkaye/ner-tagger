<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pembridge Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bermuda</ENAMEX>-registered holding company headed by a former colleague of financier Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>, launched a # 697 million ($1.13 billion) takeover bid for U.K. paper and packaging concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG PLC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pembridge</ENAMEX> is offering 590 pence ($9.54) for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> share. It said this month that it would make a bid at ``somewhat below'' the market price at the time, which was 604 pence. Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> shares jumped 4 to 599 pence on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s stock exchange yesterday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> officials so far have spurned the approach by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pembridge</ENAMEX>, which has built up a 25% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX>. To win over a majority of holders, analysts say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pembridge</ENAMEX> may have to increase its offer to 650 or 700 pence a share. But at that level, they say, the high cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pembridge</ENAMEX>'s financing would quickly erode the potential profit from breaking up the company.
