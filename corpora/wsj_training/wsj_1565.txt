A letter from Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kerry</ENAMEX> chides us today for implying that he had ``flip-flopped'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX>. He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time, hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup.
Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise. It meant to convey our hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Senator</ENAMEX> and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>, for example, also are part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Castro</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Medellin</ENAMEX> cartel nexus. In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition, Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerry</ENAMEX> makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap. We were wrong.
