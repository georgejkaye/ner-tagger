The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> earthquake.
The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance, but the cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
By a lopsided 401-18 margin, the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters, and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991, and the issue forced a confrontation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> leadership and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> district was at the center of the earthquake last week. Going to the well of the chamber, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX> demanded the costs be fully counted. His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead.
``We do not come to this House asking for any handout,'' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Democrat. ``We do not intend to hide these costs from the American people.''
The $2.85 billion package incorporates $500 million for low-interest disaster loans, $1 billion in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters. The funds are in addition to $1.1 billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from Hugo, bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $4 billion in unanticipated spending.
Because of the vagaries of Gramm-Rudman, the immediate impact is relatively small. But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991. Within the appropriations process, the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget.
The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight, and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and, critics say, mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance. The hastily drafted measure could hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required. And the state's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year.
Also, the high price of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average. For example, disaster loans, which will go to small businesses and homeowners, offer credit as low as 4% in some cases. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $500,000 from $100,000 to assist the hard hit but often wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina</ENAMEX> district.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> is expected to make some modifications today, but both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight's deadline. Administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding, and the Senate changes are expected to be largely technical -- dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total Small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Administration</ENAMEX> loans to $1.8 billion to accommodate the increased activity expected.
Yesterday's floor action came as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill, representing a 5% reduction from last year and making severe cuts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests for installations abroad. An estimated $25.8 million is allocated to continue work in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oman</ENAMEX>. But all funding is cut for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>, and projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> are cut to $13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request.
Closer to home, the negotiators were more generous. An estimated $38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.G. Hefner</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> chairman. And $70.2 million would go to projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> represented by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> counterpart and fellow Democrat, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> are traditionally powerful within the conference, but equally striking is the dominance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Byrd</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">W.va.</ENAMEX>) even added report language listing $49.4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year.
No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>), who chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> defense subcommittee. In the final trading, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> was insistent on setting aside $500 million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal 1990. But it gave ground to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye</ENAMEX> on a number of projects, ranging from a $11 million parking garage here, to a land transfer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, to a provision to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> state. The tribe is one of the poorest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inouye</ENAMEX>, who chairs the select committee on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Affairs</ENAMEX>, used his power to move $400,000 from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> to the Bureau of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Affairs</ENAMEX> to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative, cutting other federal spending 0.43% to pay for it. A formal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference is expected to ratify the accord later this week.
