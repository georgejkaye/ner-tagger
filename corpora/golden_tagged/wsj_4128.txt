<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armand Hammer</ENAMEX> loves biographies.
The industrialist, art collector and self-appointed diplomat has written or commissioned no fewer than four books about himself, with a fifth in the works.
But Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s affection for literary introspection screeches to a halt when it comes to the work of a bespectacled journalism instructor who has spent nearly five years assembling the first unauthorized Hammer biography.
So perturbed is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental Petroleum Corp.</ENAMEX>'s venerable chairman by ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armand Hammer</ENAMEX>: The Untold Story'' that he's trying to scuttle the book's planned publication this month by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX>'s Little, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown & Co.</ENAMEX> subsidiary. Lawyers for the 91-year-old executive complain it's ``riddled'' with scandalous falsehoods distressing to the doctor and his family. The lawyers have threatened to file suit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and have already taken the first steps toward filing a suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> declined through a spokesman to discuss his objections to the book, but the prospect of a rumble over the biography has hands rubbing in the book world, where controversy equals sales. Author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Bruck</ENAMEX>'s timely inside look last year at junk-bond king <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> jumped to the best-seller list after the brokerage house fought bitterly with the author. Salmon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rushdie</ENAMEX>'s nearly impenetrable ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satanic Verses</ENAMEX>'' took off only after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayatollah Khomeni</ENAMEX>'s death threats.
Speaking generally, ``as a publisher, we're delighted when someone attacks our books,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Osnos</ENAMEX>, associate publisher at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random House Inc.</ENAMEX>, the division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Publications Inc.</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ebury Press Ltd.</ENAMEX> subsidiary holds the British rights to the unauthorized biography of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>.``It's the modern-day equivalent of being banned in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Weinberg</ENAMEX>, the book's author, maintains that Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s dilemma isn't truth but ego. ``He has spent so much time building his image and wanting to be remembered in a certain way that now he's troubled by cracks appearing because of the book,'' he says, maintaining that every detail in his densely footnoted work has been checked for accuracy.
While in many ways an admiring portrait, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX>'s book looks at much that Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> covered up or glossed over in his most recent, best-selling autobiography, published in 1987. It explores a questionable bankruptcy filing by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s father, which a court-appointed official suggested was fraudulent. It finds that the doctor failed to mention plans to visit post-revolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> when applying for a passport in the early 1920s and recounts scrutiny by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> of the doctor's early travels to that nation.
Moreover, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX>, who teaches investigative journalism at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>, has unearthed documents indicating that although Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s insights on East-West relations are generally listened to, he has scarcely been the valued confidant of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> officials and presidents as he has portrayed. Once he was even publicly ridiculed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin Roosevelt</ENAMEX>, according to the book.
Letters by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s lawyers, sent to Little Brown this summer and obtained by The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>, complain that the biography ``is beyond redemption by correction,'' containing dozens of passages implying that Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> ``is and has been throughout his life unscrupulous and willing to attain personal goals and ambitions through criminal act, breaches of fiduciary duty or other unconscionable behavior.''
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s British lawyer, in a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ebury Press</ENAMEX>, goes further, charging that ``it is difficult to envisage a more despicable attack upon a gentleman who, throughout his long life, has done so much for his country and so much in the interests of health care and world peace.''
Counters Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX>, ``the objections in the letters are both ludicrous and defamatory.''
Such are the battles of unauthorized biography these days, in a market hungry for inside dope on the rich and famous. Authors and their subjects have squabbled for years; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Wilde</ENAMEX>'s advice to the famous was to outlive their biographers. Most lawsuits don't inhibit properly researched biographies in this country, although libel laws in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> and elsewhere make opposition easier overseas.
According to the 41-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX>, his decision to play Boswell to Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s reluctant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> came about almost by accident in 1984, when a friend considered and then discarded the idea of a biography of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>.
Though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX> wasn't aware of it at the time, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> soon knew all about his project. According to Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s lawyers, he had gotten the details from a copy of the publishing proposal, one that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX> angrily says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> wasn't entitled to have.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Brown</ENAMEX> beat out five competitors for the publishing rights, agreeing to pay a $160,000 advance for the book. And, starting in 1986, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX> wrote seven letters to Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> asking for interviews.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> never responded. Senior executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental</ENAMEX> avoided Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX>'s calls. Even the company's top spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Ashley</ENAMEX>, refused to return any of the 20 or so calls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX> made.
Though locked out of the company, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX> began contacting more than 1,000 people who had once worked for Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> or otherwise knew him. About 700 agreed to talk.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s apparent displeasure with the unauthorized biography hung like a pall over the project. The Soviet government informed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX>, through its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.A.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> Institute of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX>, that is wasn't interested in aiding his research. Advice columnist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abigail Van Buren</ENAMEX>, a longtime friend of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>, agreed at first to meet with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX> but changed her mind after talking to one of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s lawyers.
But others did talk, including Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Buren</ENAMEX>'s twin sister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Landers</ENAMEX>, and publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Forbes</ENAMEX>. Both spoke of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX> in laudatory terms.
Countering the official silence from Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberg</ENAMEX> dug into dozens of cases of personal and commercial litigation, government investigations, divorces, property transactions and correspondence that have marked Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s long and active life. To add breadth to the search, he hired researchers from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX> and studied documents originally written in a dozen languages, including Chinese and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estonian</ENAMEX>.
The letters by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s lawyers arrived soon after the book was set in type, apparently based on a reading of a review copy. Copies of the letters were sent not only to Little Brown but also to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Richard Munro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas J. Nicholas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Ross</ENAMEX>, the top executives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>.
So far, the saber-rattling hasn't halted publication in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Brown</ENAMEX> is distributing 50,000 copies to bookstores. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ebury Press</ENAMEX>, facing preliminary steps of litigation, had agreed to wait at least until the end of last month before proceeding.
