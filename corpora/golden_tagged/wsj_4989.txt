<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie Group L.P.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton H. Meyerson</ENAMEX> has withdrawn as a general partner because of ``differences in business philosophy'' with fellow general partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dort A. Cameron III</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie</ENAMEX> also said that, as a result of that split, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard E. Rainwater</ENAMEX> has withdrawn as a limited partner.
None of the three could be reached for comment but the split between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyerson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX> was described as ``amicable'' in a news release by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie</ENAMEX>. The investment partnership is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie</ENAMEX> officials wouldn't comment on whether they planned to maintain a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> office.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Robinson</ENAMEX>, who represents Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainwater</ENAMEX>, said the departure of his client, a long-time friend of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyerson</ENAMEX>'s, was also friendly.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie</ENAMEX> is an outgrowth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment L.P.</ENAMEX>, a profitable investment partnership founded by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainwater</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX> in 1984. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment L.P.</ENAMEX> was part of a shareholder group that won a 1988 proxy battle for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consolidated Oil & Gas Inc.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainwater</ENAMEX> has withdrawn from managing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment L.P.</ENAMEX> but will remain as a limited partner.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment L.P.</ENAMEX> is no longer seeking new ventures, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie</ENAMEX> would continue to do so. ``The participation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainwater</ENAMEX> had in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Airlie</ENAMEX>, while significant, as a percentage of the whole thing was fairly small,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie</ENAMEX> will continue to be actively looking for new investments. It's just that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX> will be doing it.''
Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie</ENAMEX> was among the investors backing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am Corp.</ENAMEX>'s unsuccessful bid to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlie</ENAMEX> is said to have amassed funding of more than $1.6 billion since it was founded a year ago by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX>, a former aide to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> junk-bond chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyerson</ENAMEX>, who was president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Data Systems</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Ross Perot</ENAMEX> owned the company.
In addition to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainwater</ENAMEX>, other Airlie investors included brothers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Bass</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitable Life Assurance Society</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. They will remain as limited partners, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX> said.
