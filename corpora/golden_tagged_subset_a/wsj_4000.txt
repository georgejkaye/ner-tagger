A group including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm I. Glazer</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, private investor, said he and members of his family hold a 6.24% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley-Davidson Inc.</ENAMEX> and may seek control of the company.
In a filing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> said it acquired the stock of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>-based motorcyle manufacturer as an investment and currently is evaluating its position with respect to the company.
The group may seek to acquire a controlling interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX> or seek representation on the company's board. It didn't rule out approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX> management or board members in connection with its possible plans.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX> officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment yesterday.
According to the filing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glazer group</ENAMEX> holds 539,200 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX> common shares, including 187,700 shares bought from Aug. 1 to Sept. 29 for $29.31 to $40.185 a share.
Depending on market conditions and other factors, the group may buy more shares or sell shares in the open market, in private transactions, or ``otherwise,'' the filing said.
As the price range in the filing indicates, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX>'s stock has been moving sharply higher in recent weeks. When asked about the jump last week, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley</ENAMEX> official said that the company wasn't aware of any reasons for the stock's strength, saying ``we're trying to figure it out ourselves.'' One rumor that surfaced late last week -- and was quickly squelched by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley</ENAMEX> -- was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> was interested in buying the company.
News of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glazer group</ENAMEX>'s filing wasn't disclosed until after the close of the market yesterday.
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley</ENAMEX> shares slipped 50 cents to close at $39 1/8. Since mid-September, however, it has surged from $32 a share to trade as high as $40 5/8.
