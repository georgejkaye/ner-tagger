As expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Interstate Bancorp</ENAMEX> reported a net loss of $15.5 million for its third quarter because of hemorrhaging at its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Interstate Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> unit.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based bank holding company disclosed last Friday that it had taken a huge $350 million provision for loan losses at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> bank, the result of the state's worsening real-estate market.
