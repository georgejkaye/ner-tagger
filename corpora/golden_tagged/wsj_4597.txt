<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Systems Technology Inc.</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Pension Trust</ENAMEX> seized its 85-title film library and other collateral after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Systems</ENAMEX> defaulted on a loan with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> trust.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Pension Trust</ENAMEX> credited the company nearly $3.8 million after taking control of the library, reducing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Systems</ENAMEX> remaining debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> to $12.6 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Systems</ENAMEX>, which converts black-and-white film to color videotape, said it is working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Pension Trust</ENAMEX> to restructure the debt.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Systems</ENAMEX> shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $2.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Systems</ENAMEX> first disclosed in March that it had missed the debt payments and that it might ``seek relief from creditors'' to complete a reorganization. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buddy Young</ENAMEX>, the company's president and chief executive officer, yesterday said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Systems</ENAMEX> doesn't anticipate filing for bankruptcy-law protection. The company's total debt stands at about $17 million, he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Systems</ENAMEX> will have a net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 after taking a $4 million nonrecurring write-down from the loss of the library, which includes the film ``Room at the Top,'' and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbott & Costello</ENAMEX> television series. But on an operating basis, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> said, the company will post the largest profit in its history.
