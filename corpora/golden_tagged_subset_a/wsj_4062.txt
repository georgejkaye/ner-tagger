<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistics Canada</ENAMEX> said its industrial product price index declined in August for the second consecutive month.
The index, which has a base of 100 for 1981, was 131.1 in August, off 0.1% from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> but up 1.8% from a year earlier.
The agency attributed the 0.1% August decline partly to an appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. It said the currency change put downward pressure on vehicle and pulp and paper prices.
Prices of intermediate goods were off 0.2% from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and up 1.1% from a year earlier. Prices of finished goods were unchanged from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and up 2.8% from a year earlier.
