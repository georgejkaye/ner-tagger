<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks closed with marginal losses, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index bouncing back from early lows owing to last-minute arbitrage buying.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> stocks finished moderately lower on profit-taking among market makers.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index of 225 selected issues, a 70.66-point gainer Monday, was down 1.47 points at 34471.07.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Wednesday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index rose 77.89 points to 34548.96.
Tuesday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 650 million shares, up from 490 million Monday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing shares, 481 to 442, while 195 others remained unchanged.
As the directions of the foreign exchange market and domestic interest rates remained unclear, investors were cautious, shying away from active buying, traders said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masami Ohkuma</ENAMEX>, a senior trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBS Phillips & Drew International</ENAMEX>, called Tuesday's trading dull, a disappointment for major brokerage houses that declared Monday that the market had touched bottom and was poised for a rebound.
Although these brokers were trying hard to spread optimism, it is difficult to encourage cautious investors to participate in active buying, another trader asserted.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Stock Price Index (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Topix</ENAMEX>) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 3.80 points Monday, was down 3.16 points, or 0.12%, at 2619.07.
The Second Section index, which gained 15.38 points Monday, was up 2.90 points, or 0.09%, to close at 3412.09.
Volume in the second section was estimated at 22 million shares, up from 19 million Monday.
Tuesday's losers were spread widely among steels, constructions, part of hightechnologies, pharmaceuticals and foods.
All ``big five'' steels continued to retreat following last week's gains. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Steel</ENAMEX> fell 14 yen (9 cents) to 776 yen ($5.31). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kawasaki Steel</ENAMEX> shed 12 to 825.
High-technologies were mixed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> lost 60 to 8,160 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TDK</ENAMEX> was down 80 to 5,550, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX> added 150 to 4,350.
Pharmaceuticals were sold on profit taking.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yamanouchi</ENAMEX> lost 50 to 3,760, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eisai</ENAMEX> dropped 60 to 2,380 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chugai</ENAMEX> was up 40 to close at 2,200.
On the other side, gainers included housing issues. Traders said the sector attracted investor interest because of their strong earnings outlook due to growing demand for high-quality houses.
An analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dresdner-ABD Securities</ENAMEX> said, however, that only a limited number of housing issues recommended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities</ENAMEX> have been bought lately. Thus, it is still premature for housings to lead the market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sekisui House</ENAMEX> was up 30 to 2,520 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa House</ENAMEX> climbed 60 to 2,720.
Real estates and railways received buying interest for earnings prospects based on existing property holdings Tuesday, but ended mixed as investors took profits, traders said.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 100-share index closed 12.3 points lower at 2361.5, some 10 points above a session low of 2351.4 and decidely off the intraday high of 2379.4.
The narrower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 30-share index settled 10.6 points lower at 1948.3. Volume was 393.5 million shares, up from 310.2 million Monday.
Thin market conditions, which largely featured market-makers dealing among themselves, helped to amplify the level of selling in the market, dealers added.
Dealers said market makers were active in liquidating holdings in a broad array of shares, positions they had built up in recent weeks anticipating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>-SE 100 would aggressively test its all-time high of 2443.4.
Though dealers stopped short of saying the action marked a big turnaround in sentiment, they acknowledged continued liquidation like that featured yesterday could push the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>-SE 100 through the technically and psychologically important 2350 level and potentially end chances of a substantive rebound in the index during the next few weeks.
Some of the bad news is focused around U.K. defense contractor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s problems with its U.S. subsidiary. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s search for fresh capital as it tries to sort through its problems with the unit has helped to refocus attention on potential for less than robust U.K. corporate earnings growth, dealers said.
During the session, a number of brokerages also downgraded their earnings projections for various companies, which helped to add further weight to the growing sentiment, dealers said.
A late announcement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX> that it may bid for a friendly stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX> helped inject some fresh confidence into what has largely been a takeover-driven market, dealers said. But the market didn't react aggressively outside bidding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares sharply higher.
Dealers said the lack of overall market response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> news wasn't totally surprising. They maintained that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> was widely known to be shopping for potential partners for some time and its share price has been moving steadily higher in recent months as a result.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s largest pharmaceutical maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaxo</ENAMEX> was a major loser despite pretax full-year earnings that were in line with market expectations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaxo</ENAMEX> fell initially on profit-taking after the results and then on modest downgradings by some brokerages after the company said it expects margins to narrow over the remainder of the year. It closed at # 15.25 ($23.97), down 61 pence (96 cents), in active trading.
Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>. South African gold stocks closed higher.
Share prices closed lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX>, were higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX> and little changed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX>.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>.
