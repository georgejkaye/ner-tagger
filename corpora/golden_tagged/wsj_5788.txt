It sounds incredible, even for a boondoggler like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX>.
But a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> program run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX> to auction off property confiscated from scofflaws is losing money.
No one seems certain exactly how much because, government auditors say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>' books are a mess. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> aides believe the program has fallen some $8 million in the hole since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> took it over in 1985. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> staffers put the loss at $10 million.
``There have been real problems with how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Customs</ENAMEX> has managed this contract from the very beginning,'' says Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Levin</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> Democrat. ``Now we're seeing some of the unfortunate results.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, as reported, is investigating the matter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affidavits</ENAMEX> filed in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> allege that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> has been making ``fraudulent claims'' to the government and ``deliberately billing'' it for storage of items that have been out of the company's hands for up to three months.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> officials won't comment on the criminal inquiry. But they say the program's critics fail to consider that even worthless goods must be stored while a suspect's case slogs through the legal system. They also say balance-sheet estimates by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> don't take into account property that the government decides not to sell off, but instead distributes to various agencies for their own use. If credited for those transfers, they argue, the program would be in the black.
``We've done a very outstanding job,'' insists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy P. Hooks</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> executive who runs the program. ``We're providing an outstanding service to Customs and a benefit to the taxpayers.'' But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> agents in the field tell a different story. Documents unearthed by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX>'s staff and made available to this newspaper suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> is mismanaging things, and that monitoring by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> is deficient. ``The administration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> contract may be leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> vulnerable to a charge of waste, fraud or abuse,'' warns a June 1988 memo from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs' Southwest</ENAMEX> region office to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> headquarters.
The June memo says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> charged $25,516 for 16 days storage of 503 pieces of loose pipe. When regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> officials, checking up on the company, solicited a comparative bid from a local pipe yard that serves as a bonded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> warehouse, they found ``an identical shipment with the same amount of sorting work would cost $4,300 for one month's storage, including all in\ handling charges,'' according to the memo.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hooks</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX>'s tally was justified because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> ordered the pipes sorted, stacked and transported in unusually quick fashion. He also says the company was unable to find a lower-cost alternative. Still, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> spokesman says of the incident: ``There is a problem there. Thank God things like that don't happen very often.''
But they apparently do, if the memos obtained by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX>'s office are any indication. While examples in the documents generally don't involve big dollar amounts, critics of the program say they illustrate a pattern of questionable transactions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specifically</ENAMEX>, the memos allege that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> has raised program costs by getting outside appraisals on jewelry when in-house Customs personnel could have done the job; by needlessly shuffling items from one district to another for auction; and by failing to get rid of merchandise in a timely fashion.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hooks</ENAMEX> disputes the allegations. In the case of outside appraisers, he says, they are brought in because Customs personnel aren't always equipped to handle specialized work; the government, he adds, caps the amount that can be spent on that part of the project. He also says goods are moved to a common selling point to ``get a competitive crowd and maximize revenues.'' He denies that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> fails to dispose of items quickly, though he says the bookkeeping on that can be ``skewed'' because some bidders fail to claim their merchandise. ``I have to sell some items three times,'' he says.
Nonetheless, some lawmakers argue that there is a built-in incentive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> to run up costs, all of which are covered by the government. Though up to 80% of the company's fee is based on performance -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> consistently has rated it ``very good'' -- the basic fee structure that's negotiated at the outset of the fiscal year is linked to anticipated program expenses. Thus, the more costs soar, the higher the next year's base fee is likely to be. ``The contract is so loosely drawn, it's riddled with opportunity for fraud,'' charges Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Clay Shaw</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Republican.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> spokesman contends that ``the government is not out to make money'' on the program, which he says is designed to free agents from ``custodial duties'' so they can concentrate on law enforcement. But Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaw</ENAMEX> counters, ``We seize hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets, and then we throw it all away. We envisioned the whole process as potential profit.''
Actually, most of the seized items aren't auctioned off at all; almost three-quarters are remitted, usually as part of a settlement in which the original owner pays Customs its costs -- and often a penalty on top of that. ``Customs should be in the black no matter how you cut it,'' Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX>'s aide says.
Part of the problem may be the way the government calculates costs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX>, for instance, sold for $100 some jewelry that had been seized in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Paso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> put the cost of the sale at $819. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> says $774 of that amount stems from a government formula to recoup overhead expenses. ``Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> did nothing wrong, there's still obviously a problem here,'' says the aide to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> was brought aboard to make the seized-property program run smoother after a 1983 report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s investigative arm, blasted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX>' management of the program and recommended hiring a private contractor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> won the accord because its sophisticated computer system could track Customs' nationwide inventories.
Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> committees are abuzz that it might be a shoo-in to win an extension of the pact, which recently was put out for bid. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> says it isn't even planning to go after the contract again because it's trying to focus on its core aerospace businesses.
