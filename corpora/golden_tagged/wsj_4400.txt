Major trans-Pacific container ship companies have agreed to raise shipping rates to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> effective next April 1.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans-Pacific Westbound Rate Agreement</ENAMEX>, a rate-making body based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, said its 10 members plan to raise rates by $140 to $250 a 40-foot container, or about 10%. The ship conference represents such major carriers as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American President Cos.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maersk Line</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea-Land Services Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSX Corp.</ENAMEX>
The increase, if it sticks, would help restore westbound container rates to 1979 levels before rates plummeted, the conference said. Among the commodities affected are forest products, scrap metal, chemicals, resins, hay, food products and manufactured goods.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Gottshall</ENAMEX>, the conference's managing director, said attempts by trans-Pacific carriers to raise westbound rates Sept. 1 and March 1 were largely resisted by shippers.
The conference hopes to garner greater support for its April 1 rate increase by giving shippers six months advance notice. ``Shippers have indicated that it makes their lives much easier if they can plan for rate changes way in advance,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Smith</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alex.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown & Sons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>.
