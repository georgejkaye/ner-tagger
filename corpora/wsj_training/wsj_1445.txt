<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner Peripherals Inc.</ENAMEX>, which has a near-monopoly on a key part used in many portable computers, is on target to surpass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> business history.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers. It said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared 72% to $11.8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $6.8 million, or 19 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Its revenue totaled $184.4 million, an increase of 172% from $67.8 million a year ago.
For the nine months, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Jose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>-based company said net income jumped 84% to $26.9 million, or 69 cents a share, from $14.6 million, or 43 cents a share. Revenue nearly tripled to $479 million, from $160 million.
Analysts expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner</ENAMEX>'s earnings to reach roughly $40 million, or $1 to $1.05 a share, on sales of $650 million, for 1989, the company's third full year in business. That's a faster growth rate than reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX>, which didn't post similar results until its fourth year, in 1986. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX>'s performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers, the computer industry's fastest-growing segment. Since its inception, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines.
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> controls an estimated 90% of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers. The company supplies drives to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zenith Data Systems</ENAMEX>, the top two U.S. manufacturers of laptops, and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharp Corp.</ENAMEX>, the leading Japanese laptop makers.
``They've had this field to themselves for over a year now, and they've been greatly rewarded,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Katsive</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disk/Trend Inc.</ENAMEX>, a market researcher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Altos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
In the coming months, however, this is likely to change. Next month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagate Technology</ENAMEX>, which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers, plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers.
And the Japanese are likely to keep close on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner</ENAMEX>'s heels. ``They are going to catch up,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Claridge</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC</ENAMEX> already produce hard-disk drives, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also is studying the field, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claridge</ENAMEX> said.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> isn't standing still. Yesterday, the company introduced four products, three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks. Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of power and one weighs just 5.5 ounces.
``Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our (older) products,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finis Conner</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name. ``We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can.'' These new products could account for as much as 35% of the company's business in 1990, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> estimated. ``We're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> already is shipping its new drives. Last week, for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine, which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase.
From its inception, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> has targeted the market for battery-operated machines, building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagate</ENAMEX>. The availability of these drives, in turn, boosted demand for laptop computers, whose usefulness had been limited because of lack of storage.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conner</ENAMEX> also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX>, which as of July owned 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner</ENAMEX>'s stock. Sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> represented 26% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner</ENAMEX>'s business in its third quarter, compared with 42% in the year-ago period.
