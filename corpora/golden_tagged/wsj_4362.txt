<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> has all but run out on the fiscal 1990 budget. Only one of the 13 regular appropriations bills has reached the president. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> has now voted on capital-gains and a drug-bill funding deal appears concluded, it's too late for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to complete the remaining spending bills on time. Instead, the president is sent an ``emergency'' continuing resolution to get us past Sunday, when the government would otherwise have to shut down.
Still looming Oct. 16, however, is budget director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX>'s Gramm-Rudman-Hollings report, saying whether, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-R-H</ENAMEX> accounting rules, the deficit forecast will exceed the $110 billion trigger for fiscal 1990, and, if so, what the sequester (or, across-the-board cuts) will be.
Will the deficit be significantly greater than the $100 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-R-H</ENAMEX> target? Will federal spending be held in check? Will there be a sequester? A lot depends on the strategy the president employs during the next two weeks.
The president, no doubt, hopes for a ``kinder and gentler'' scenario. To wit, after a smashing victory in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> on the Jenkins capital-gains plan, he signs the energy and water appropriations bill and the continuing resolution -- in order to give evidence of wanting to ``work with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.'' In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, he wins again on capital gains, defeating Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX>'s IRA ``substitute.'' The reconciliation bill then sails through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> without any additional major changes. At the president's urging, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> trims remaining appropriations and holds spending just tight enough to get the deficit estimate under the $110 billion sequester trigger.
But budget season is not a kinder, gentler time. Already, the president is at a strategic disadvantage, having little option but to sign the continuing resolution that extends through Oct. 25. Without action by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the Oct. 16 report should invoke a sequester. Had the continuing resolution's expiration date been sooner than Oct. 16, the president would have been in a position to veto any extension that invoked a sequester and could have used the threat of a shutdown as a bargaining chip.
Before the month is out, the two sides will begin to play hardball. What's likely is some variant of the following scenario:
After passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenkins</ENAMEX> plan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, the president signs the energy and water bill, as well as the continuing resolution. Despite the president's opposition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> then passes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bentsen</ENAMEX> IRA plan, but the Democrats fail in their effort to eliminate the ``bubble'' (raise the marginal income-tax rate to 33%). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenkins</ENAMEX> plan makes it through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.
The Democratic leaders, now eager to force a confrontation with the president over new taxes, give the green light to the appropriations committees to incorporate ``essential'' additional spending. They pass the word to the appropriators that a sequester may be in the works, so in anticipation domestic spending is increased and cuts are made in defense and foreign affairs. They give a similar green light to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means and Finance</ENAMEX> committees, and amid rancorous exchanges the majority accepts numerous ``add-ons'' to entitlement programs.
Just before Oct. 16, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> sends the president a reconciliation bill and an omnibus appropriations bill tied together. With increased spending and a revenue loss, a sequester is imminent. The Democratic leadership agrees to relent, provided the president asks for a modest tax increase -- modest in the present year, but increasing rapidly thereafter.
This is the tricky part. To nearly everyone's amazement, the president signs the omnibus package. However, he reveals that he plans to exercise his authority under the Constitution to item-veto individual spending accounts -- sufficient to get the forecast deficit below the $110 billion trigger. (This is the controversial proposal that has been championed on this page and elsewhere.) No sequester is ordered.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Democrats (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Synar</ENAMEX> again?) promptly sue in federal court, and the outcome is uncertain. But President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, if he prevails, has made a major advance in restoring the power of the presidency over budgetary matters. And even if he loses, he will have won. The Democrats, not he, will be seen as forcing a sequester. And, by at least trying, he will have kindled a national debate, perhaps leading to a line-item-veto constitutional amendment or at least to new ``rescission'' authority. Also, whether or not he prevails in court, he will have lowered the spending baseline, making it easier to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-R-H</ENAMEX> next year.
Of course, let's not forget the debt ceiling, which is now a cliff. If not revised earlier, on Nov. 1 the ceiling falls from $2.87 trillion to $2.17 trillion, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government will have no choice but to default on its obligations. (It is conceivable that this could be avoided by the president's taking Draconian steps to restrain spending immediately -- sure to be challenged in court -- and\ to sell the gold in Fort Knox; neither is likely.)
Neither the congressional leadership nor the administration has any interest in holding up revision of the debt ceiling. But it appears a group of fiscal conservatives in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> may well threaten to block a debt-ceiling bill in order to get major concessions. Unfortunately, the changes they have in mind are quite modest -- a rescheduling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-R-H</ENAMEX> deficit targets and a phasing out of the Social Security surplus in the calculation of the deficit (i.e., the proposal being sponsored by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Gramm</ENAMEX>). Far better would be real procedural reform, such as enhanced rescission authority, biennial budgeting, making the budget resolution a joint resolution instead of a concurrent resolution (that is, making it a law), and so forth.
So there is good news. Federal spending probably will be lower next year than many had reason to believe when the budget process got started in January. There is not likely to be a tax increase, and the budget deficit will at least be lower than last year. Also, there is a chance the president will assert, or be granted, more control over federal spending.
The bad news is that we have to go through all of this again next year
