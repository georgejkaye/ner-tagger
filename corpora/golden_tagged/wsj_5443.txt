<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert I.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toussie L.P.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based investment partnership with a 9.9% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lionel Corp.</ENAMEX>, said it would consider extending its offer to acquire the rest of the specialty toy retailer.
The partnership had set a Sept. 18 deadline for the company to consider the $8.25-a-share, or about $100 million, offer for the remaining stock.
In a letter contained in a filing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toussie</ENAMEX> chastised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lionel</ENAMEX> for letting the offer expire without first convening a board meeting to consider it.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lionel</ENAMEX> informed the partnership that the regularly scheduled September board meeting fell after the deadline for the proposal expired. If the offer was still valid at that time, it would be added to the regular agenda, it said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toussie</ENAMEX> said the partnership is considering adding to its stake and would ``keep all of our options open'' regarding the possibility of either filing a lawsuit or making a hostile offer if the board refuses to meet with it. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lionel</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the company hadn't seen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing and wouldn't comment.
