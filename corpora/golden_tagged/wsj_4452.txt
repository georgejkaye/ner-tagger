Democratic Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Morrison</ENAMEX> is calling for a grand-jury investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> during the years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Pierce</ENAMEX> was Secretary. That's a good idea. Better a grand-jury investigation, which at least operates under an established and identifiable rule of law, than the kangaroo-committee hearings into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> that Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lantos</ENAMEX> and his peers are staging. Both Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> and his former aide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Wilson</ENAMEX>, are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lantos</ENAMEX> committee. It looks to us as if these two men are standing up to another bullying committee -- and for the right reasons. Both Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> charge that the committee's statements so far make it clear that it has prejudged them. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> adds that the committee is setting him up as ``a prime candidate for a criminal investigation.''
On Tuesday Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> and his colleagues ripped into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Pierce</ENAMEX> for citing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> rule that lets subpoenaed witnesses bar cameras from their hearings. An incensed Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> argued that the rule was adopted during ``the notorious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccarthy</ENAMEX> hearings.'' Today, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX>, the rule isn't ``required as a protection to any witness.'' What Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> left out was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccarthy</ENAMEX>-era rule was created after civil libertarians complained that publicity-seeking Congressmen were using the televised hearings to beat up on witnesses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incredibly</ENAMEX>, a familiar Mccarthyite phrase rang out at the hearing to muzzle Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s lawyer. ``Point of order,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Shays</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Weickerian Republican</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>. ``There are two people sitting at the desk who haven't yet been invited; they're not yet part of this process.''
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> agreed and told attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Perito</ENAMEX> not to speak. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perito</ENAMEX>: ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chairman</ENAMEX>, respectfully --''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX>: ``You have not been called upon to make a comment, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perito</ENAMEX>. If this chair recognizes you, you will make a statement, not until then.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perito</ENAMEX>: ``I will accede to the chair's request.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX>: ``It's not a request, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perito</ENAMEX>. In essence, gentlemen, at this hearing you are in fact a potted plant.'' So much for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miranda</ENAMEX> rule.
From what has come out of the hearing so far, the conclusion of a full-page treatment of the issue and 34 named principals in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> last month still appears to hold: ``The activities revealed so far do not appear to be illegal, investigators say, but questions have been raised about the size of some fees and the propriety of the lobbying involved.'' Presumably a grand jury would officially establish what has been generally conceded. Then perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> and the others would feel free to talk plainly about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. The odor of red meat would drift out of the hearings, taking with it most of the klieg lights and panting coverage, but what would remain -- pure politics -- would still be very much worth the public's attention.
The public might discover what the members of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX>'s committee and his witnesses already know -- that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> since its birth in 1965 has been a playpen for developers and politicians. Instead of market-driven development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s projects are inherently political. When subsidized projects go up, some politician takes credit for the achievement and some developer ends up making political contributions (also legal).
In the Reagan years, the ``crime'' was that the developers' political overhead went into consultants' fees and not into a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Congressman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAC</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bluntly</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> wants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s money to go to his colleagues and their projects. Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> really is incomparably sleazy; if so, maybe someone should start talking about shutting the place down.
For now, we have the current standoff, in which two Ivy League lawyers named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> have decided that to survive they have to stand up to Congress by invoking a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccarthy</ENAMEX>-era rule written to protect citizens from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s kangaroo committees.
