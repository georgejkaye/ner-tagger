<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.D. Searle & Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX> unit, is launching a program to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them.
Called Patients in the Know, the program features fact sheets designed to be easy to understand. The sheets tell how the medicine works, describe how to use it and list its possible side effects. They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Searle</ENAMEX> will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores.
Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients. ``We believe that every drug that's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Teich</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Citizen Health Research Group</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Nader</ENAMEX> affiliate. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teich</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Searle</ENAMEX> is ``the only company I know that voluntarily'' will make consumer information available.
According to federal officials and drug-industry studies, nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year aren't used properly, meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication. ``We think it's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Searle</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheldon Gilgore</ENAMEX>.
