<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom International Inc.</ENAMEX> announced a major financial restructuring that gets the company out of the high-yield ``junk'' bond market and gives it considerable flexibility to make acquisitions and pursue other expansion plans.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>'s chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Biondi</ENAMEX>, said the company is considering a number of ``small-to-medium-sized acquisitions,'' such as television stations, and has had talks with a number of other entertainment concerns regarding possible combinations or joint ventures. The company also continues to pursue a sale of an interest in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime Networks Inc.</ENAMEX> unit to other companies in the cable-TV industry, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>, a broadcasting, cable-TV, and entertainment concern, was acquired two years ago in a $2.3 billion leveraged buyout by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Amusements Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dedham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, theater chain controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sumner Redstone</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Amusements</ENAMEX> wound up with control of 83% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>, and has since sold a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> assets to raise cash and to pay off debt.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> declined to discuss recent reports that the company has had talks with companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> about a possible merger or other combination. ``What both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumner and I</ENAMEX> have said is that we will consider any deal that makes sense for the company,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> said. But he stressed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> won't be sold outright because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redstone</ENAMEX> ``wants to be involved in management and be a significant owner'' of any concern.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redstone</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> has considerable borrowing capacity available if it wants to make a big purchase, which it will pursue ``if it makes rational sense.'' But he agreed with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> that ``we wouldn't do it unless we control the company.''
As part of the restructuring, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> said it is replacing its remaining $1 billion of high-yield bank debt with a $1.5 billion unsecured bank agreement. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> said the new credit line will give the company $400 million to $500 million in additional borrowing capacity, part of which will be used to redeem $200 million principal amount of its 15.5% junior subordinated debentures due 2006. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> has a total of about $480 million of these securities outstanding.
``We can now retire the preferred without selling more assets,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> said yesterday. ``Under the old agreement, we would have to hock assets to retire the preferred or other outstanding debt.'' Since the 1987 buy-out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> has raised cash from the sale of assets such as its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orion Pictures Corp.</ENAMEX> stock for $44 million and two cable systems for $545 million.
While a number of such highly leveraged companies have had extreme difficulty recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> appears to have emerged from the high-yield market as a healthy ongoing concern. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biondi</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redstone</ENAMEX>, who is chairman of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Amusements</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>, said in a statement that the financial restructuring announced yesterday removes ``the last vestiges of our LBO structure'' and frees the company of a number of restraints contained in the prior credit program.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> said its new 10-year bank agreement, provided by a group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank N.A.</ENAMEX> unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> will allow it to lower interest costs significantly and to launch a $500 million commercial paper program, which was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> board yesterday. Under the new bank agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> can make as much as $300 million in asset sales without bank approval, and invest as much as $300 million in ventures or existing operations without approval.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> may have some tough going ahead, however. The company is launching a new cable comedy channel at the same time as one being launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archrival Home Box Office</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> The competition is likely to be fierce among the two, which are also embroiled in a major legal battle in federal court here. In May, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX>, charging unfair competition in the pay television market.
