<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monarch Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> has decided not to sell its disability income insurance business and instead plans to expand it, with the goal of doubling its size in the next three years.
Last July, the company hired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> Capital Markets to help it study various strategies for the unit, including boosting its growth, reinsuring existing blocks of the business or selling it entirely. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monarch's</ENAMEX> stock surged after the announcement on speculation that if the unit were sold the cash might be used to buy back  shares or even take the firm private.
Last year, the disability income unit contributed $19.5 million of Monarch's total $33.8 million in pretax profit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon N. Oakes Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monarch's</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive, said the insurer had terminated talks with several companies that had expressed an interest in buying the unit.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakes</ENAMEX> said the interest that other insurers showed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monarch</ENAMEX>'s disability income products that was ``the determining factor'' in the company's decision to keep the unit. Many life insurers want to offer disability income insurance, but would prefer to let Monarch handle the underwriting, administration and claims processing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monarch</ENAMEX>'s highly automated back office already handles disability income insurance products for eight other insurers, which sell the policies under their own name. Some 14 other companies sell the Monarch disability income policies under Monarch's name through their sales agents.
Monarch shares fell 50 cents to close at $37.50 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday.
