Upset over the use of what it says are its exclusive trademarks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hells Angels Motorcycle Corp.</ENAMEX> is fighting back -- in court. Concord <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Horizons Corp.</ENAMEX>, creators of a 1988 movie called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nam Angels</ENAMEX>, used the gang's name and trademarks without authorization, the not-for-profit corporation says in a complaint filed in federal court.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nam Angels</ENAMEX> depicts a group of the cycle gang's members on a mercenary mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viet Nam</ENAMEX> during the war years.
In addition to being broadcast on cable television, the movie also is being distributed on videocassettes, the suit alleges in seeking unspecified damages. Also named in the suit is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Home Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Culver City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, its parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heron Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broadstar Television</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, holders of the copyright on the movie.
A Concord spokeswoman called the suit ``unfounded'' but declined to comment further.
Besides being upset with the film's use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hells</ENAMEX> Angels name and logos, the Angels are angry with their depiction in the movie.
``There is absolutely no way our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hells</ENAMEX> Angels in this movie,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Christie</ENAMEX>, president of the club's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ventura</ENAMEX> chapter. ``Portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization -- loyalty and trust.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nam</ENAMEX> Angels shows Angels fighting with each other and also depicts them as showing no remorse when a member is killed. Both of these actions aren't characteristic of real Hells Angels, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christie</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hells Angels</ENAMEX> was formed in 1948 and incorporated in 1966. In addition to 26 chapters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, there are 40 chapters in foreign countries.
