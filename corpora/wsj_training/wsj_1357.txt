A federal judge granted a temporary stay of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Student Aid Commission</ENAMEX>'s emergency action to stop guaranteeing loans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Technical Schools</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Education & Software Inc.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Student Aid Commission</ENAMEX> took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Technical Schools</ENAMEX> for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop-out rate far in excess of federal standards, and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Education & Software</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> education services company, called the commission's action ``precipitous and unwarranted.''
The court set a hearing on the emergency action for Oct. 30. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Education & Software</ENAMEX> posted a $250,000 bond against potential losses to the student aid commission and to taxpayers in guaranteeing any more loans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Technical</ENAMEX> Schools students prior to the hearing.
