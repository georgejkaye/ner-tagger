The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> shelved an unfair-trade complaint against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> after receiving assurances that the Latin American country will take certain steps to protect the patent rights of foreign pharmaceutical companies.
Trade Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> announced that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association</ENAMEX> has agreed to withdraw its complaint as a result of continuing progress in negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> and its promise of further concessions. However, she warned that the U.S. won't ``hesitate to reopen the matter if {further} progress is not forthcoming.''
The association, which represents the leading U.S. drug manufacturers, confirmed that it is withdrawing the complaint. In its petition filed in August 1988, the trade body charged that, since 1980, its members had lost $526 million in sales opportunities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> because the absence of legal protection for pharmaceutical patents allows the sale of unauthorized copies.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> didn't disclose how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> intends to satisfy the U.S. industry's demands. She acknowledged, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Argentina</ENAMEX>'s willingness to ``modify its pharmaceutical product-registration procedures.'' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> said she will pursue the issue further with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>'s Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Domingo Cavallo</ENAMEX> and Economics Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nestor Rapanelli</ENAMEX>. Both officials are expected to accompany Argentine President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Menem</ENAMEX> in his visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> this week.
