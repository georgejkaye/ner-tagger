The suit, filed by shareholders Kalman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Hager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, seeks class-action status for shareholders who owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> stock as of May 10, 1989, and alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty in devising the rights offering. The suit seeks an injunction against the implementation of the plan, plus unspecified damages.
