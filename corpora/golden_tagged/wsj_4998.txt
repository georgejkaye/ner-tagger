<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi Group</ENAMEX> said its trading activities could post a loss of $100 million by the end of 1989 because of the impact of ``extraordinary events'' on international trading operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> said in a brief statement that the losses would be reflected in the parent company's balance sheet and that financial operations have ``largely been completed'' to offset the losses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> issued the statement in response to a report in an Italian financial newspaper that the trading practices of two senior traders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> office had cost the group as much as $200 million for operations including, but not limited to, soybean trading.
