This hasn't been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg Co.</ENAMEX>'s year. The oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share. The company's president quit suddenly. And now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant.
The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, facility wasn't to begin turning out product until 1993, so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills Inc.</ENAMEX>, has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX>' share is about 27%.
Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>. Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales.
Analysts say much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krispies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frosted Flakes</ENAMEX>, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say.
``Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch food</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Maguire</ENAMEX>. ``They are not a happy group of people at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Battle Creek</ENAMEX> right now.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Battle Creek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world.
Another analyst, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Maxwell Jr.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Securities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, recently went to a ``sell'' recommendation on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> stock, which closed Friday at $71.75, down 75 cents, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading. ``I don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> can get back to 40% this year,'' he said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s main problem is life style. People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that's `healthy' for you -- oats, bran.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX>' share increased to 30% or more.
In announcing the plant delay, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E. Lamothe</ENAMEX> said, ``Cereal volume growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has not met our expectations for 1989.'' He said construction wouldn't resume until market conditions warrant it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities. The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Battle Creek</ENAMEX> headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity. A large plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Covington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>, is to come on line next year.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> officer, who asked not to be named, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX> project was ``pulled in for a reconsideration of costs,'' an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction. Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
A company spokesman said it was ``possible, but highly unlikely,'' that the plant might never be built. ``As we regain our leadership level where we have been, and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity, we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan,'' he said.
The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s largest construction project. The company had retained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluor Daniel</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluor Corp.</ENAMEX> as general contractor.
But in recent weeks, construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site. Subcontractors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fluor Daniel</ENAMEX> already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said.
Last Friday's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic. Until recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.
Although he called current market conditions ``highly competitive,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamothe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year. Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.
As expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> reported lower third-quarter earnings. Net fell 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share. Sales rose 4.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.
The company had a one-time charge of $14.8 million in the latest quarter covering the disposition of certain assets. The company wouldn't elaborate, citing competitive reasons.
