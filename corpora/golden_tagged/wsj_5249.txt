A shareholder in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> filed suit in federal court here, claiming that officers of the company artificially inflated the stock's value by misrepresenting the concern's financial prospects.
The class-action complaint by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Schwartz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, follows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX>' announcement Monday that it expects to post third-quarter net income of 35 cents to 38 cents a share, well below analysts' previous estimates of 47 cents a share.
The stock, which had been trading at $33.50 a share, plummeted following the announcement. In national over-the-counter trading, it closed at $24.75 a share, up 50 cents.
The suit, filed for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace & Haber</ENAMEX>, also names as defendants several company officers, including three who allegedly sold shares of Stratus in August.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX> spokesman wasn't immediately available to comment on the suit.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX> official on Tuesday said the company became aware Sept. 14 that it wouldn't realize third-quarter expectations, and ``made every effort to make the information public as soon as it became available to us.'' The company has declined to confirm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> figures on stock sales by its executives, reported in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> Wednesday.
According to the suit, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> bought 100 shares of Stratus Aug. 9 at $31.875 a share. The suit seeks unspecified damages related to the recent fall in the company's share price.
