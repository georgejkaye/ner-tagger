All <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Winkler</ENAMEX> wants is a chance.
Sure, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX>'s resume is impeccable. After spending a decade as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fonz</ENAMEX> on ``Happy Days,'' he jumped a few years ago to producing and directing. He directed last year's MGM release, ``Memories of Me,'' starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Crystal</ENAMEX>. He briefly was director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touchstone Pictures</ENAMEX>' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hooch</ENAMEX>,'' with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Hanks</ENAMEX>, but left early  on because of ``creative differences.'' He directed various TV shows. He's been executive producer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s ``Macgyver'' for five seasons.
But sorry. That just isn't enough to guarantee a job directing commercials. Not anymore.
That's right, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX> wants to turn his hand to directing commercials. But now that so many motion picture and TV directors are clamoring to direct commercials -- now that commercials are seen as downright fashionable as well as profitable -- it isn't easy to break in. Indeed, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX> has taken a step that no self-respecting name director would have had to take years ago: like a beginner, he's created a speculative reel of commercials to show advertisers what he can do.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX>, ensconced in his cluttered office on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> lot, a space crammed with movie posters, paper work and photographs of his family, is clearly nervous as he shows a visitor the reel. This is the first time an outsider has gotten a glimpse of the still unfinished cut of six commercials. Soft-spoken, in baggy pants and loafers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX>'s only touch of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> is the matching pink of his button-down shirt and slouchy socks.
``Thirty seconds is a lot more difficult than two hours,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX> says. ``Every three-second cut is so vital, it's shocking. Anybody who thinks they can waltz in and do {commercials} from a different discipline is in for a rude awakening.''
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX> calls himself ``brand new at this,'' he actually has more than a passing familiarity with commercials. He acted in about 30 of them as a struggling young actor, happily taking them on while his former classmates at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> drama school turned up their noses and waited on tables instead. He was a shill for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alberto VO5</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H&R Block</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Talon</ENAMEX> zippers and Sanka coffee. More recently, he directed his first two TV commercials, one for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX>, and a second for Worlds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wonder</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Ruxpin</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiat</ENAMEX>\ client.
The idea for creating a reel, though, came in early summer, after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX> agreed to direct commercials through Odyssey <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Filmakers</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odyssey Entertainment</ENAMEX>. Despite his established reputation, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX> didn't have much of a track record in commercials. At the same time, other feature film directors with more film experience than he has were swarming over the TV ad business.
Clearly, the stigma that once attended TV commercial work is almost gone. Part of the credit goes to the handsome pay: top commercial directors make from $7,500 to $10,000 a day and really big names can make almost double that. And directors say filming commercials is a lot like going to the gym -- it keeps them in shape between films.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX>'s bid for entree into commercials is a series of six fake ads for four real products. There are two funny spots for Le Menu frozen chicken dinners starring his friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Tucker</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Markowitz</ENAMEX> on ``L.A. Law'') with a flock of live chickens. There's a biker chick for Windex. And there's a spot with two little boys eating Doritos. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX>, who is active in children's charitable organizations, is known for working well with kids.
Sitting on the edge of his chair, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winkler</ENAMEX> doesn't relax until, at the reel's end, his visitor offers a compliment. Then he collapses in relief. ``I look at commercials with great respect now,'' he adds. ``What it took to get them on the screen is extraordinary.''
Ad Notes....
ACQUISITION: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landor Associates</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-based identity management firm that helps companies manage their corporate and brand images. Terms weren't disclosed, but industry executives believed it would fetch around $20 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald M. Casey</ENAMEX>, 53, who headed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y&R</ENAMEX>'s design and sales promotion operations, becomes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landor</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Diefenbach</ENAMEX>, who had been president and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landor</ENAMEX> and who industry executives say has been unpopular with some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landor</ENAMEX>'s management, will move to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y&R</ENAMEX> as director of corporate development. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diefenbach</ENAMEX> is a ``talented'' executive and declined to comment on his popularity.
