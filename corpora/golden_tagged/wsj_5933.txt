<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico Wines & Spirits International</ENAMEX> said it plans to introduce <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Priviet</ENAMEX>, a premium vodka from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>, in the U.S. in October.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Priviet</ENAMEX>, whose ad pitch will be ``Serious vodka you don't have to take too seriously,'' will be priced around $10 a bottle, compared with the $13 generally charged for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX>'s Stolichnaya line of Russian vodkas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Priviet</ENAMEX> will be launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhode Island</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX> expects to roll it out nationally next year.
The new vodka will be included as part of a 1972 trade agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico Inc.</ENAMEX>, a soft-drink, snack food and restaurant concern. Under the pact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola</ENAMEX> concentrate is sold to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, and in return, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX> is given the rights to supply Russian vodkas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Translated roughly from Russian, Priviet means ``my best regards,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX> said.
