One day after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed Inc.</ENAMEX> made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie, its stock didn't trade and the company forecast a ``significant'' drop next year in sales of its core product.
That disclosure came, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> alerted the company that trading wouldn't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided.
In addition to the forecast, the company also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead. The spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> stock today.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX>, which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease, on Tuesday announced the resignations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert S. Ehrlich</ENAMEX>, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie I. Shapiro</ENAMEX>, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. They were succeeded by executives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fresenius USA Inc.</ENAMEX> and its parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fresenius AG</ENAMEX>, which owns about 45% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX>.
At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Brunswick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Medical Care Inc.</ENAMEX> Following that announcement Tuesday, however, company officials were unavailable to elaborate.
Yesterday, the spokeswoman said sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> products through the exclusive arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Medical</ENAMEX> accounted for 87% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX>'s 1988 sales of $21.1 million. The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Medical</ENAMEX>, the spokeswoman said.
Nonetheless, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> currently expects that 1990 sales... will be significantly below their 1989 level,'' the company said in a statement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> said yesterday that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fresenius USA</ENAMEX> would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels. In any case, supplies to patients won't be interrupted, the company added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fresenius</ENAMEX>, a West German pharmaceutical concern, has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70% and 80%. The transaction also would combine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fresenius USA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX>.
But the plan now is being ``reformulated,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> said, declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination. Said the spokeswoman: ``The whole structure has changed. The value of the company has changed.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> did say that the proposal still would infuse cash into Delmed but less than the $10 million originally expected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX> also would receive the North American rights to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fresenius AG</ENAMEX> products.
Another option for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delmed</ENAMEX>, the company said, is that it could sell its plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ogden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>. It added that no discussions about such a sale are under way.
