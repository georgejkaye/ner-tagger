Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses, the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> would have been much less, as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial ``Subsidizing Disaster.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands, such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX>.
As you mentioned, subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal Barrier Resource System</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Taxpayers Union</ENAMEX> would like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coastal Barrier</ENAMEX> Improvement Act of 1989.''
This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support. Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development. However, home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxpayers Union</ENAMEX> study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to $9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years. Already, the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated $800 million.
