<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> said it may have to buy back about $415 million of convertible debentures, including about one-third of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX>'s stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, after the planned restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> is completed.
The move appears designed to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s original investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>.
Under agreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> will, if requested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>, offer to buy back two series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> debentures, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> said. The buy-back, at par plus accrued interest, would occur within 12 months after the planned restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and its subsidiaries is completed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> is an investment holding and real-estate concern owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reichmann</ENAMEX> brothers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> would offer to repurchase all of its 184 million Canadian dollars (US$155 million) of 7.5% convertible debentures, Series A, and all of its US$260 million of 7% convertible debentures.
At last report, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> held C$46.6 million of the Series A debt, convertible into 1.48 million shares, and all of the 7% debt, convertible into 10 million shares. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> debt held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> is convertible into stock representing about one-third of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s 38.4% fully diluted stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX>'s fully diluted stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> is currently 43.2%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> said the aggregate amount needed to buy back the debentures can't exceed the net proceeds received by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and its subsidiaries from the restructuring. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> has agreed to lend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> US$250/NNP million to help it meet liquidity needs, and will supervise a major refinancing and restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and its subsidiaries, which include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s and other department store chains.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> said its agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> regarding the restructuring will be in effect for two years and may be extended to about four years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross Cowan</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.</ENAMEX>, said the buy-back agreement appears to be a ``safety clause'' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s earlier investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s stock price doesn't improve after the restructuring.
``It looks like a backstop for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> to protect their original capital in the convertible debentures,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cowan</ENAMEX> said.
The Series A debt is convertible into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stock at C$31.50 a share, and the 7% debt is convertible at US$26 a share. In trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> closed at C$15.125, up 87.5 cents, on volume of 1.2 million shares.
