Federal prosecutors said they have obtained a guilty plea from another person in the government's ongoing probe of illegal payments in the record industry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Craig</ENAMEX>, an independent record promoter, pleaded guilty to payola and criminal tax charges, according to a statement issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Feess</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney here. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Payola</ENAMEX> is the practice of making illegal, undisclosed payments to radio station personnel in return for getting the stations to play certain songs over the air.
As part of his plea agreement with the government, the 44-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX> faces a maximum of three years in prison. In return, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX> agreed to cooperate in the government's continuing payola probe, says a spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney's office.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX> and three others were indicted last year as part of that payola probe. Two other defendants previously pleaded guilty, and charges against the third were dropped.
