Four workers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE Corp.</ENAMEX>'s headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis, and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX> employees to the viral infection, company and city officials said.
The four cases were all reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX>'s medical director and state and local health authorities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX> shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX>'s private food vending contractor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARA Services Inc.</ENAMEX>, was suffering from a strain of the virus, officials said. More than 700 people work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX> building. The cafeteria remains closed.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Mcbride</ENAMEX>, city health director, said his staff suspects the hepatitis, which can be highly contagious, was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus.
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted hasn't been determined but should be known by the end of the week, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcbride</ENAMEX> said.
Hepatitis A, considered the least dangerous strain of the virus, has been confirmed in at least one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX> employee, company and city officials said.
``From a public health point of view we're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening,'' said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Provato</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX>'s medical director. ``It's a double-edged sword though, because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX> officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mattausch</ENAMEX>.
The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin, which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A, in anyone who has contracted the disease, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattausch</ENAMEX> said.
``We're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattausch</ENAMEX> added, ``and that means virtually everyone who works here.
