<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technodyne Inc.</ENAMEX> is to be delisted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> because it no longer meets the exchange's financial requirements.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technodyne</ENAMEX> said that among the reasons for the delisting is that the distributor of non-prescription pharmaceuticals has been unprofitable for the past three years. The company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action Drug Co.</ENAMEX> subsidiary filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection last month.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said that the exchange takes a number of factors into account, but it ``will consider delisting'' when a company has posted losses for three of the past four years and its shareholder equity is less than $4 million.
Common shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technodyne</ENAMEX> will continue to trade on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> under the symbol <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TND.B</ENAMEX> and on the over-the-counter market.
