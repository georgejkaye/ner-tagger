The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report losses on a per-share basis, along with total amounts, in corporate earnings stories and statistical tables, starting today.
In the past, losses were expressed only as totals. Per-share numbers were calculated only when a company reported a profit.
``We're making the change partly because the per-share loss is commonly used in the business world, including many companies' earnings statements,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Pearlstine</ENAMEX>, managing editor of the Journal. ``It provides the stockholder with a gauge for equating a loss with individual holdings.''
A per-share loss also is used in calculating the price-earnings ratio of a stock. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> will continue to report the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P-E</ENAMEX> ratios and yields of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Averages each Monday. A full listing of the companies in the indexes and their profit or loss per share will continue to be published quarterly.
As with profit per share, losses per share are calculated from the number of common shares outstanding, after allowances for preferred stock dividends.
