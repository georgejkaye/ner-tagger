<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX>, seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market, unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video.
The move also helps the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly, supplying every Hollywood movie company -- isn't made obsolete by the upstart <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> business.
While the prototype converter is costly, it's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium.
``The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Niles</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> pioneer in high-definition programming. He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hdtvs</ENAMEX>.
Japanese electronic giants, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX>, have focused almost entirely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> hardware, and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition. And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development. It's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> says its new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCD HDTV</ENAMEX> converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video. Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers. Otherwise, they'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color Tvs.
It would be like ``watching a black and white movie on a color TV set,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm G. Saull</ENAMEX>, chairman of the film and video department at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochester Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>.
The new converters are ``a critical link between film and the television domain,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joerg D. Agin</ENAMEX>, vice president and general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion Picture</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audiovisual Products</ENAMEX> division.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> won't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market, but it's estimated the machine may be available within two years. A similar machine already on the market, made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank Sintel Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rank Organisation</ENAMEX>, costs about $500,000.
And the potential market is tremendous, industry experts say. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> takes off in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters, known in the industry as telecines. Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations.
``The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J. Stumpf</ENAMEX>, vice president-engineering and development at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Universal City</ENAMEX> Studios. And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niles</ENAMEX>, the program producer, contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s move is ``a sound marketing decision. They can't afford to stay out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX>.''
Indeed, the stakes are high. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> electronics industry estimates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> market will total about $150 billion over the next two decades, with an additional $400 billion expected to go for related products.
Hdtvs break down images into more than 1,100 lines, compared with 525 for today's televisions, providing considerably sharper detail. And the sets are wider, resembling the dimensions of a movie screen.
But the financial rewards aren't expected soon, nor are they guaranteed. Experts estimate the first sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hdtvs</ENAMEX> won't be available for another five to 10 years, and will probably retail for more than $3,000 each in today's dollars. Some critics say they won't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price.
Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> couldn't risk letting HDTV turn its motion-picture film business into a dinosaur. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> understands <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> is where everybody is going,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIT</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spaull</ENAMEX>.
