Two large Australian banks confirmed they purchased stakes in one another's stock but denied that merger talks are under way.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Australia Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> said it acquired ``several parcels'' of shares in rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANZ Bank</ENAMEX> said it acquired ``one package'' of shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Australia Bank</ENAMEX>.
Trading in the two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Melbourne</ENAMEX>-based banks' shares surged on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> last week on merger rumors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adelaide Steamship Co.</ENAMEX>, an investment company that owned an estimated 10% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANZ</ENAMEX>, 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Australia Bank</ENAMEX> and 8% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westpac Banking Corp.</ENAMEX>, recently sold some of its holdings.
Some analysts said those sales might have sparked the cross-buying by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Australia Bank</ENAMEX>. Some analysts say they expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Australia Bank</ENAMEX> eventually to merge. There also is speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westpac</ENAMEX> could merge with government-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> if the government decides to sell it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANZ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Australia Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westpac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth Bank</ENAMEX> are the four dominant banks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>.
