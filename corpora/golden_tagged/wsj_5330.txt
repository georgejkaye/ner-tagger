<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s surprise strike for a minority stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX> well may turn into a bidding contest for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s leading luxury car maker.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s share price soared yesterday as investors speculated that others also may amass significant holdings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares climbed 43 pence to 510 pence ($8), this year's highest level, after heavy trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s stock exchange. The stock price ``will continue to go bonkers,'' increasing pressure on any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> predators ``to be at the negotiating table as soon as possible,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gavin Launder</ENAMEX>, an auto industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> brokers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinwort Benson Securities.</ENAMEX>
In a prelude to a possibly unfriendly offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> said Tuesday that it intends to buy as much as 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares, the maximum allowed under current <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> government restrictions. Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials said they began buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares after hearing industry rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> and other auto makers wanted to pursue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>.
It isn't clear whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> actually is interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>. The No. 1 auto maker took a close look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> a few years ago, but decided then that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> had too many problems to make it a good value. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> also has a full plate already; it's struggling to turn around its sagging car market share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and is pushing to boost earnings during Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger B. Smith</ENAMEX>'s last year on the job. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX>, for its part, isn't interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Lutz</ENAMEX>, president of auto operations, said yesterday.
Analysts, meanwhile, speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s move may prompt the buying of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares by other European auto makers -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen AG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB Volvo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, Europeans aren't fettered by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law limiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. company</ENAMEX>'s holding to about 1% for 30 days.
``One could say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ford</ENAMEX> has taken all the heat and now they {auto rivals} can walk in because the door is open,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Blythe</ENAMEX>, business strategy vice president for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford of Europe Inc.</ENAMEX> ``Without a doubt, that would complicate things,'' he added in an interview at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s plush <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> office -- a block from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> dealership.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s European rivals ``will come into the fray because the thought of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s financial muscle coming into {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>} could significantly alter the balance of power'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and European luxury car markets, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Reitman</ENAMEX>, European auto-industry analyst for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBS-Phillips & Drew</ENAMEX>. Other car makers also may start buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares just to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> a more expensive target for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>. Analysts have put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s value in a takeover fight at between # 6 ($9.42) and # 10 a share, or between about # 1 billion and # 1.8 billion.
Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VW</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo</ENAMEX> spokesmen denied speculation about their possible interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot</ENAMEX> spokeswoman didn't return calls.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> declines to say how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares it owns, but has indicated its purchases wouldn't have exceeded the $15 million limit set for 30 days by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> could have bought about two million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares Tuesday, or about 1.1% of the 182 million outstanding. The British government's anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares without permission until Dec. 31, 1990.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is dangling access to cash and technological know-how in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>. But the fiercely proud British company prefers to remain independent and publicly held. In months of recent talks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> Chairman Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Egan</ENAMEX> offered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and several other car makers a chance to become passive, small shareholders. ``He hasn't found any takers for that {idea} from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> or anyone else,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blythe</ENAMEX> said. ``The terms he was seeking would give a very minority benefit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> in exchange for a big investment.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> wants more. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blythe</ENAMEX> hinted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> car producer ultimately might offer Jaguar a deal along the lines of its 1987 purchase of a 75% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> doesn't meddle with management decision-making, but ``has brought tremendous security to a company that had for 20 years lived a very precarious life,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Gauntlett</ENAMEX>, chairman of the tiny U.K. car maker.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> isn't interested in an Aston <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX>-type deal. ``You don't own very much if you only own 25%,'' said a spokesman.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, is marshaling its forces for what could be a long and costly siege. The company is courting British government officials, and hand-delivered letters to many Tuesday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials also briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> analysts late yesterday afternoon.
``I don't think we'd use the government to pressure him {Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John}</ENAMEX> into being cooperative,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blythe</ENAMEX> said. But by promoting its role as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s biggest car maker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> hopes to convince the government that it shouldn't impose additional anti-takeover protections for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> will raise its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> stake to the maximum 15% after the 30-day waiting period expires, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> executive said.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> might withdraw if a bidding war inflated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s price too much. ``There is a price above which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> won't go,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blythe</ENAMEX> said, declining to specify that price. ``We aren't interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> at any price.''
