<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Resources Inc.</ENAMEX> is working against an Oct. 15 deadline to complete the sale of its core businesses while facing the potential loss of its sales force and continued pressure from creditors.
The financial services company has been trying to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing since it failed to make interest payments in June on nearly $1 billion of debt.
In late August, Integrated signed a letter of intent to sell most of its businesses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall Financial Group</ENAMEX>, a partnership of a branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronfman</ENAMEX> family and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandy Moross</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> investor, for $310 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> hopes to reach a definitive agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX> by Oct. 15; creditors and sales representatives agree that it must be done by then if the field force is to remain intact. Otherwise, the vital sales force may unravel, and creditors will grow more restive.
``If this deal is signed, sealed and delivered on or before the 15th, they will keep 90%'' of the sales force, said one managing executive who was at a recent meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX> and about 350 managing executives here. On the other hand, he said, ``everybody I know'' will sever its relationship with Integrated if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX> transaction fails and nothing else comes along by that date.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehall</ENAMEX> in late August agreed in principle to pay $310 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Resources Equity Corp.</ENAMEX> and several other of Integrated's core financial services companies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equity Corp.</ENAMEX> is a loosely constructed group of independent brokers and financial planners who sell insurance and annuities, limited partnerships, mutual funds and other investments for Integrated and other companies.
When the sale accord was announced, Integrated said its investment banker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>, would continue to solicit bids for the units.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has received a number of firstround bids'' from other interested parties, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen D. Weinroth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated's</ENAMEX> chairman and co-chief executive. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinroth</ENAMEX> last month took a leave of absence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> to work full time at Integrated in the debt restructuring effort.
``We expect to hold to the timetable,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehall</ENAMEX>'s managing partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Lance Sauerteig</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sauerteig</ENAMEX> said so far there aren't any major obstacles to its offer, which also includes buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resources Trust Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Clearing & Services Corp.</ENAMEX> The agreement didn't include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX> is expected to continue to administer the remaining real estate and other partnership businesses.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sauerteig</ENAMEX> said he understood that sales representatives reacted favorably to the meeting. ``The reality of it is that these are very smart people... (who) clearly have been hurt by this and want to see a deal go through,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sauerteig</ENAMEX> said.
``Everybody's banking on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronfmans</ENAMEX>'' concluding the deal, the Integrated managing executive said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinroth</ENAMEX> declined to identify the other parties he said had sent bids to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> family was rumored to be interested, but a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors Co.</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Golden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, beer company, said no one at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> has any knowledge of any such bid. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufman & Broad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bass</ENAMEX> also had been rumored to be interested. But sources familiar with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bass</ENAMEX> say that after reviewing the assets he lost interest.
``I'm certainly hopeful'' that a higher bid will come along, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinroth</ENAMEX> said. ``Obviously a buyer who will take everything would make our life easier.'' Asked whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehall</ENAMEX> would consider getting into a bidding war for the Integrated units, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sauerteig</ENAMEX> said, ``We made our bid, and we think it was a fair proposal.''
Meanwhile, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinroth</ENAMEX> dismissed speculation that a bankruptcy-law filing is imminent for Integrated. ``We certainly don't have any intention of filing in the immediate future,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinroth</ENAMEX> said. He said he isn't under any increased pressure from creditors, who are owed a total of about $1.8 billion.
Senior Integrated creditors, who hold claims of about $1 billion, would receive proceeds from the sale of the Integrated core businesses. They and other creditors then would receive a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated</ENAMEX>'s remaining real estate and other partnership assets, which Integrated currently values at about $700 million. The partnership assets, which would have a long-term value of $2.5 billion, will gradually be liquidated.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinroth</ENAMEX> declined to speculate on what would happen to the discussions with other bidders or the agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX> if Integrated were forced into bankruptcy. ``We don't have a definitive agreement with them (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX>), so that isn't addressed,'' he said. ``I'm sure it's one of the issues that will be covered'' in a definitive agreement.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinroth</ENAMEX> also said the company is preparing its second-quarter financial report. ``We found something we had to write down that was big, but we will probably find something else'' that would help balance it, he said. ``It's going to hurt the cash flows a little bit.'' He said he doesn't think the report will substantially alter a restructuring plan that Integrated expects to file with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> in three weeks.
The plan apparently offers senior creditors a little more than 70 cents on the dollar for their claims and junior creditors half that much. Integrated junior junk bonds are trading at about eight cents on the dollar, while senior debt is trading at about 38 cents on the dollar, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.D. Smith & Co.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sauerteig</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehall</ENAMEX> said he isn't sure how a bankruptcy-law filing would affect the agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated.</ENAMEX> ``It would make some difference if we've already negotiated a definitive agreement,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Walzer</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.D. Smith</ENAMEX>, which trades in distressed securities, said he doesn't think a bankruptcylaw filing is a short-term probability. ``It's hard for me to think of an interest group who would benefit'' from a filing before the sale of the core companies is closed, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Miller</ENAMEX>, an attorney representing senior Integrated creditors, said that although his group feels a bankruptcy-law filing is ``always an available'' alternative, ``we {'ve been urging bondholders to hold the course while we conduct due diligence.'' He said the bondholder group hired the firm he works for, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlack, Israel & Liberman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> to evaluate Integrated's assets.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said, ``Our position is that in bankruptcy the chances are very, very great that there will be less value to distribute.'' He cautioned that the sales force is ``a bunch of indpendent people'' and said ``the fear is that in a bankruptcy proceeding these people would abandon'' the company.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> conceded that some junior bondholders who are ``looking at eight to 10 cents on the dollar'' are angry. ``Some of them are very indifferent about whether this thing goes into Chapter 11'' of the federal Bankruptcy Code, he said.
