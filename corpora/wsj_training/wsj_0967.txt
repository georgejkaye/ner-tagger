<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North America Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz AG</ENAMEX>, paid Massachusetts $9.1 million in taxes, bringing to an end a 10-month-long corporate tax chase.
Officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Revenue</ENAMEX> had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court. But ``the check arrived in the mail,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Kidder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX>, which had said it didn't owe taxes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> partly because it sells its cars at a dock in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> and not in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, didn't explain its change of heart.
Last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press, the commissioner said. The dispute was the subject of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> article in August.
The amount covers taxes, interest and penalties owed from 1966, when the state began collecting corporate taxes, to 1985. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years 1986 through 1988, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kidder</ENAMEX> added.
Under Massachusetts tax laws, corporations must pay 9.5% of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities, including warranties, customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships.
