For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay Pacific Airways</ENAMEX>, the smooth ride may be ending.
The first signs of trouble came last month when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> carrier, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swire Pacific Ltd.</ENAMEX>, posted a 5% drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year.
Securities analysts, many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s interim figures, believe more jolts lie ahead. Fuel and personnel costs are rising, and tourism in and through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> remains clouded by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s turmoil since the June 4 killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>.
In addition, delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes. And tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline.
There also is concern that once <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> reverts to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s sovereignty in 1997, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> will be forced to play second fiddle to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s often-disparaged flag carrier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, or CAAC.
``The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod Eddington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s commercial director.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Hall</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Capel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">) Ltd.</ENAMEX>, says there isn't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s tight labor market, or the strengthening of the local currency, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. These factors are further complicated by the airline's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> says.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s profit to grow around 13% annually this year and next. In 1988, it earned $2.82 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> (US$361.5 million) on revenue of HK$11.79 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> is taking several steps to bolster business. One step is to beef up its fleet. In addition to aircraft from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 Airbus A330-300s. The expansion, which could cost as much as US$5.7 billion over the next eight years, will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991, up from 30 at the end of last year, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd.</ENAMEX>
The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s aging fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Tristars</ENAMEX> for regional flights, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. Fierce bidding for young employees in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is pushing up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s labor costs by 20% a year for low-level staff, while experienced, skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain. Some jobs already have been moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, and there are plans to place others in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Bell</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the airline, says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> is working to promote <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as a destination worth visiting on its own merits, rather than just a stopover. Although the June 4 killings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> have hurt its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> flights, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s other routes have retained high load factors. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> regards promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as an important part of attracting visitors from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged.
There also has been speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> will be among the major private-sector participants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government's plans to build a new airport, with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> officials decline to comment on the speculation.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s recent link with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> -- as an important part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s strategy. But he emphasizes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> hasn't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carrier or with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>, the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade. Analysts believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis, particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers.
``We think alliances are very important,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> says. ``But we'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else's. I'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother.''
In a pattern it aims to copy in several key <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> destinations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> recently announced plans to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> by flying into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carrier.
``We'll never have a big operation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and they'll never have one as big as us in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> says. ``But this way, American will coordinate good extensions to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>. We'll coordinate on this end to places like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bangkok</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian traffic</ENAMEX>, which currently accounts for 65% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX>'s business, is expected to continue as the carrier's mainstay. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> to 14, and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>. Further expansion into southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> is also possible, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX>, the spokesman.
While a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997, such a move isn't an option for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> because it would jeopardize its landing rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> emphatically rules out a move to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>: ``Our lifeblood is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> traffic rights.''
He says the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s airlines, which include the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Dragon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlines</ENAMEX>, will continue to be negotiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s government. But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>.
``My feeling is {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> doesn't} have a hope in the long run,'' says an analyst, who declines to be identified. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay</ENAMEX> would love to keep going, but the general sense is they're going to have to do something.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddington</ENAMEX> acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes, but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future. ``We're confident that it protects our route structure,'' he says, ``and our ability to grow and prosper.
