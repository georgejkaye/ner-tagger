``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Crowd</ENAMEX>'' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Ramsey Ehrlich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry J. Rehfeld</ENAMEX> (Little, Brown, 444 pages, $19.95), describes the displacing of the old ``our crowd'' Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Steinberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Weill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Wasserstein</ENAMEX>. Its many lively stories include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutfreund-Postel</ENAMEX> holiday cheer imbroglio. These two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Crowd</ENAMEX> families lived in the same apartment building, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postel</ENAMEX> penthouse perched on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutfreund</ENAMEX> duplex. The penthouse elevator started up from the Gutfreund landing, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Gutfreund</ENAMEX> used to turn off its light, to give the impression that there was no higher floor. Eventually, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Postel</ENAMEX> broke his toe in the dark.
Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutfreunds</ENAMEX> determined to put up a 22-foot Christmas tree, weighing a quarter of a ton, to amaze their holiday guests. For this, a crane needed to be mounted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postels</ENAMEX>' terrace. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postels</ENAMEX> did not give permission. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutfreund</ENAMEX> workers went ahead anyway, only to be captured ``in flagrante'' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Postel</ENAMEX>, who called the police.
Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutfreunds</ENAMEX> finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and an 18th-century mansion with a specially excavated $1 million garage in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postels</ENAMEX> had obtained an injunction to prevent any future hoisting of trees, and in a neighborly spirit hit both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gutfreunds</ENAMEX> and the building with a $35 million lawsuit. Nothing less, it seemed, could console them for their traumas.
Where had all the money come from? The young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gutfreund</ENAMEX> had been discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Salomon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Bros.</ENAMEX> when he was still a bearded liberal, and put to work as a trader, and then as a rough-and-tumble syndicator. ```Get off your...,' he would bellow,'' say the authors. Rising in the firm, he became powerful and bland, though his new wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX>, made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks. After he had been head of the company for 3 1/2 years, he and his partners sold it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phibro</ENAMEX>, a powerful commodity trading outfit, for $550 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phibro</ENAMEX> stock. Limited partner Billy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX>, whose family name had been on the firm's door for 70 years and who had hoped it would be there forever, was not consulted. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gutfreund</ENAMEX> collected $32 million, while Billy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> got $10 million, much less than if he had conducted the sale. ``I felt betrayed,'' he later said. Worse, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX>'s timing had been off. Its profits, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phibro</ENAMEX>'s, soared over the next two years, and had it held out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> could have gotten an even bigger bundle.
The book also recounts the not dissimilar maneuvers surrounding the changing of the guard at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehman Bros.</ENAMEX> and other grand old firms. Often the genteel, conservative, long-term-oriented investment bankers were displaced by crude traders: ``When angered, he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale-blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits,'' the authors say of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Glucksman</ENAMEX>.
The earlier generation of ``our crowd'' bankers -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belmonts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warburgs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lehmans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baches</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schiffs</ENAMEX> -- had stressed above all probity, tradition, continuity and reputation. They were old-fashioned elegant gentlemen, who happened to be of German Jewish extraction. But in the harsh world of today's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous successors. The cuckoo prefers the nests of other birds and heaves out their eggs. But the old guard hired the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Crowd</ENAMEX> people: It brought in its own cuckoos. So, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Crowd</ENAMEX> toppled from the branch, it shouldn't have been too surprised.
The old guard had every right, however, to disdain the newcomers' new ways of making money, such as greenmail. (A Fortune article on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Steinberg</ENAMEX> was entitled, ``Fear and Loathing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Boardrooms.</ENAMEX>'') Their other staple has been corporate takeovers, often hostile and financed by junk bonds. Hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon. Sometimes they are constructive, but often not. First, by making management focus on short-term results, they inhibit building for the future -- just the opposite of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. Second, a long-term shareholder of a good company needn't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily: It will bounce back. But if a raider takes over when the stock is weak, the shareholder never gets his recovery.
The raiders, meanwhile, have evolved their own pattern for spending their new millions. As described in ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Crowd</ENAMEX>,'' they take on ambitious new wives, move to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bedford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, buy OK pictures, and let their wives share the wealth with decorators. Having donated heavily to museums, they demand a place on their boards.
The book is patronizing about this nouveau riche struggle for respectability, which has its tawdry aspects. However, on balance, the charity game helps <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>. If those who have the money don't get involved with the museums and the charities, then City Hall will do it, badly. It has been rightly observed that the main thing wrong with tainted money is, t'aint  enough of it.
A handful of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Crowd</ENAMEX> operators have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal, and have ended up in the slammer or paying huge fines: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Boesky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Levine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Siegel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Posner</ENAMEX>, and now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leona Helmsley</ENAMEX>. The glitzy office that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Boesky</ENAMEX> vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Rich</ENAMEX> and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinky'' Green</ENAMEX>, today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Crowd</ENAMEX> is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this. However, the phenomenon is not specifically Jewish. It has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in, and that a few will cut corners in the process. Some pretty seamy stuff built the turn-of-the-century families' Fifth <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newport</ENAMEX> palazzi and endowed their daughters' weddings to foreign noblemen. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> was a piker compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Gould</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Fiske</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Commodore Vanderbilt</ENAMEX> thought nothing of bribing judges and legislators. So who knows? In a generation or two some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Crowd</ENAMEX> may attain true respectability, perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors. Or perhaps Wall Street, when it has suffered enough, will realize that finance is a service industry, and change its ethos.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Train</ENAMEX> is president of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Train</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Investment Counsel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
