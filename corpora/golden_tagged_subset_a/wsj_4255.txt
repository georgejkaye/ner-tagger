Anti-nuclear activists sued the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Administration</ENAMEX> and the president to stop the Oct. 12 launch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galileo</ENAMEX> probe to Jupiter, citing safety risks.
The three groups, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Coalition for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace and Justice</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christic Institute</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foundation on Economic Trends</ENAMEX>, alleged in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> court here that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> had underestimated the risks of the launch. They said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> hadn't planned how to evacuate people around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in case the shuttle Atlantis exploded. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantis</ENAMEX> will boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galileo</ENAMEX>, which carries 50 pounds of radioactive plutonium for power.
Galileo ``will condemn thousands of persons residing in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> to a wholly unnecessary and virtual certainty of contracting cancer in the event of a shuttle accident resulting in the release of plutonium,'' the groups said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> have long contended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galileo</ENAMEX> is safe. In nearly all potential accidents, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s impact statement, the plutonium release would be so small it wouldn't cause any cancer deaths.
A separate interagency panel also rated the safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Galileo</ENAMEX>, and came up with some substantially different risk assessments than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NASA</ENAMEX>. To pick up enough speed to reach Jupiter, for instance, Galileo must fly twice past Earth. If the craft crashes into Earth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> estimated that only nine cancer deaths could result. The interagency panel, however, said the cancer death count could total, at worst, 2,000.
