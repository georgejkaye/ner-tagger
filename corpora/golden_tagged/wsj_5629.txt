Have you driven a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> lately? Before long, the answer might be yes even if your car is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> or, perhaps, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> yesterday jolted the automotive world -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> -- by disclosing that it wants to buy a stake of up to 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s leading luxury-car maker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX>. The announcement came just two weeks after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> said it was negotiating ``closer cooperation'' with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab Scania</ENAMEX>
Other European auto makers -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group Lotus PLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automobili Lamborghini S.p. A.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfa Romeo S.p. A.</ENAMEX> -- have surrendered their independence in recent years, but now the trend, driven by growing competition, may be shifting into high gear. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s overtures to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> haven't produced any firm deals yet, auto-industry watchers are already wondering who's next. Prime candidates for an alliance, they suggest, are <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vickers PLC</ENAMEX>, which makes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolls-Royce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bentley</ENAMEX> cars, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porsche AG</ENAMEX>. Some even suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayerische Motoren Werke AG</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX>, might one day need a partner.
All are gilded marques that confer instant status on their owners, especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, where sales of European luxury cars boomed in the early 1980s. But in the last few years, their U.S. sales have plunged, thanks to a lower dollar that made all imports more expensive and to an onslaught of new competition from Japanese luxury cars. Now, many of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s best-known small auto makers -- BMW being the notable exception -- are struggling financially, and unable to spend the huge sums needed to develop and market innovative new models in an increasingly competitive world.
``The European little guys were already losing out as independent competitors before the Japanese came on the {luxury-car} scene,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Womack</ENAMEX>, research director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Motor Vehicle</ENAMEX> Program at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>. ``I basically think all the little guys are going to become subsidiaries of the big guys.''
Such a shakeout promises to be shaped by individual corporate strategies, executive egos and, not least, by national pride. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s bold bid to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfa Romeo</ENAMEX> a couple of years ago got squashed when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S.p. A.</ENAMEX> came on the scene, and argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfa</ENAMEX> should be kept in Italian hands. Likewise, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> tried to buy the Land <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rover</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leyland</ENAMEX> subsidiaries of state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BL PLC</ENAMEX> three years ago, British politicians howled at the thought of foreigners owning a national institution. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> backed off.
It isn't clear how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British pride</ENAMEX> might affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s move on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>, but the U.S. auto maker clearly will have to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s corporate pride first. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s terse announcement was made at around 4 p.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> time and 11 a.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDT</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>. ``We believe there are substantial benefits for both companies in a holding that could lay the foundation for a long-term association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Lindsey Halstead</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, said. He praised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> as ``an outstanding British company with a distinctive product range,'' and promised that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> should eventually gain control, it would keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> ``as a separate and autonomous entity.''
Those diplomatic words notwithstanding, the announcement caught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> executives flat-footed. Though rumors of a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> overture had been circulating since last spring, the executives had no warning of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s decision beyond a phone call from the auto maker just before the announcement yesterday.
``I think we are going to remain independent,'' declared Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Egan</ENAMEX>, the tough-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> chairman who was dubbed ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Iacocca</ENAMEX>'' for rescuing his company from the brink of bankruptcy in 1986. ``I would remind you of the'golden share' provisions.''
The ``golden share'' is a strong anti-takeover measure. When the British government sold its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> in 1984, it retained one share that prevents any outside investor, British or foreign, from buying more than 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> without the government's permission. The golden share expires on Dec. 31, 1990.
It isn't clear how the British government might view <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s move, but the spate of British acquisitions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> in recent years might head off outright opposition. ``We look silly if we don't allow Americans to buy here,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Willetts</ENAMEX>, director of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based think tank with close ties to Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>. ``The last thing you want is to give the economic nationalists in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> an excuse to be obstructive about British takeovers.''
But it is clear that, beneath Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>'s stern words and the golden-share protection, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s fortunes are slipping badly. The company recently reported a precipitous decline in pretax profit for the first half of this year to # 1.4 million ($2.2 million) from # 22.5 million. In recent months, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> has talked to virtually every major car maker about a possible partnership, but found nothing to his liking yet. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s problems, and those of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saab</ENAMEX> as well, illustrate the woes afflicting virtually every one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s small auto makersa  situation that contrasts starkly with their huge prosperity earlier in the decade.
Then, a strong dollar made imported goods of all kinds inexpensive to Americans. The Reagan years -- with their robust stock market and recovery from recession -- made upscale consumption fashionable. European makes became the cars of choice for a generation of Americans who suddenly had money, but wanted no part of their father's Oldsmobile, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s U.S. sales jumped 55% between 1983 and 1986. During the same period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX>'s American sales surged 63%, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX>'s 35%, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porsche</ENAMEX>'s 40% and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX>'s 83%.
European auto makers got so bullish on America they expanded their plants. In early 1984, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX> could produce 105,000 cars a year. Over the years it kept enlarging its factories, to the point that now it has the capacity to build 180,000 cars annually. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX> had assumed its sales in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would continue to grow. But the world was changing.
In 1985, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit burgeoning, governments of the major industrial nations agreed to drive down the value of the dollar. The U.S. currency nearly halved in value compared with other major currencies, and suddenly, European cars weren't so affordable any more.
The base sticker price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>'s 900 four-door sedan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, for example, has soared 38% in the last four years to $17,515. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> 190D with a 2.5-liter engine has jumped in price more than 27% since 1986.
Making matters worse, Japanese auto makers invaded the luxury-car market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> led the way with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acura</ENAMEX> division, which sold nearly 53,000 cars in its inaugural year, 1986. Last year Acura sold more than 128,000 cars, and many were purchased by people who once owned European cars.
One is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pendergast</ENAMEX>, who lives in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> and markets financial services. Just last month he traded in his 1986 Saab turbo for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acura Legend</ENAMEX>, which carries a sticker price of nearly $27,000. ``One of the things I miss is having that'ugly' Saab around,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pendergast</ENAMEX>, who concedes he grew fond of the Swedish car's quirky shape. But he says he found the Acura far more comfortable, with a much smoother ride.
The Japanese threat to the Europeans is only getting worse. Last month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> launched its luxury Lexus line in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and in November <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> is unveiling its Infiniti models. The Japanese offer technologically advanced cars that get completely re-engineered every four to five years. The big change on European models, in contrast, tends to be their price tags; the Europeans often make only minor physical changes in their cars for the better part of a decade.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s 1988 model XJ6 luxury sedan, for example, is the only car the auto maker completely re-engineered during the 1980s. This year, to boost lagging U.S. sales, the company is introducing a stripped-down variation of the car, which will come without a sun roof, fancy suspension system and full-scale walnut interior trim. The price is $39,700, compared with the regular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XJ6</ENAMEX>'s $44,000. But even the ``bargain'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> costs more than the top-of-the-line Lexus and Infiniti models.
The Europeans' problem: the huge sums it takes to develop new cars and bring them to market. Small auto makers must spread those development costs -- which can run in the billions -- over a thin sales base. For years, the small European companies assumed they never had to bother with frequent make-overs of their products. Now they know better, but simply don't have the money.
Access to cash, and to technical talent, is what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is dangling before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>. ``We could help strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> in areas like advanced technological design and development, manufacturing processes and world-wide marketing,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Halstead</ENAMEX>, ``by offering full access to our technical and financial resources in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and around the world.''
What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> appears to want in return from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> is snob appeal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> has a distinctly middle-brow image, both in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Its effort to ship some of its European-made Fords into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and sell them under the pricey <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> label has bombed.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> hasn't got any $40,000 to $50,000 cars in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Healy</ENAMEX>, auto analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert.</ENAMEX> ``This is an easy way to associate themselves with a luxury-car producer that can broaden their product mix.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s risk, though, is in possibly buying a couple of losers. ``I don't see sales turning around for the Europeans,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J. Sullivan</ENAMEX>, who tracks the auto industry for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WEFA Group</ENAMEX>, a consulting firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bala Cynwyd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX> ``I don't see what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is going to gain. They would be throwing {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>} right into the teeth of Lexus and Infiniti.''
It's uncertain how the battle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> will play out, or even if there's to be a battle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is already bracing for political repercussions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> is a national symbol. At a news briefing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> executives wrapped themselves in the British flag as a pre-emptive move. ``We are the biggest British car maker,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Barron</ENAMEX>, a native <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Londoner</ENAMEX> and chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> subsidiary.
After breaking their news to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> in a phone call yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials instructed their investment bankers to start buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s purchases didn't exceed $15 million, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Blythe</ENAMEX>, vice president of business strategy for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s European operations. That's enough to buy just over 1% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares surged after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> announcement Tuesday in very heavy volume on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. Some 8% of the company's shares changed hands, and the price closed at 467 pence ($7.33), up 62 pence (97 cents). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> could command a total price of about $1.4 billion, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Chambers</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Research Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, a securities firm. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> can't buy more than $15 million worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> stock for the next 30 days, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blythe</ENAMEX> explained. But after that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> could raise its stake to 15%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s board, meanwhile, is expected to meet this week to map strategy. The company so far is keeping its options open. ``Let's get our breath back,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> spokesman yesterday. ``We only got {word of} this this afternoon.
