As the citizens of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday's devastating earthquake, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake's initial moments.
``In terms of coverage, it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Premner</ENAMEX>, president for broadcasting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>, which owns the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> affiliate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>
While rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX> outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> was unable to get its signal out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> for the first hour after the quake.
``I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Premner</ENAMEX>. ``So before I start to be really critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>, I would like to know more about what happened.''
There were no complaints from affiliates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX>
But that was not the case at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>, which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories. Last summer, the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
``I was not pleased with the slow start, and neither was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Hempel</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> affiliate WAVE in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>, said the network was ``looking into what happened.'' The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday, including a special five-hour edition of ``Today.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Browne</ENAMEX>, director of news at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>, said in an interview that ``we couldn't get a signal out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. We were out of the box. It was horrible. The comment we're hearing is that we were slow out of the box, but beat everyone else in the stretch.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday.
The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series. In place of the games, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> said it planned to broadcast next week's episodes of its prime-time Wednesday and Thursday lineups, except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night. The series is scheduled to resume Tuesday evening in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
``There are no commercials to make up for since we're going to eventually broadcast the World Series,'' said a network spokesman.
