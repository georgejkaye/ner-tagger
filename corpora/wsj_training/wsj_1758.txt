Past Due Impasse
I never pay my bills
Till the very last day;
I lose far less interest
By proceeding that way.
But it all evens out,
It's so easy to see:
Not till the last moment
Am I paid what's due me.

The effete <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyrannosaurus Rex</ENAMEX>
Had strict Cretaceous views on sex,
And that is why you only see him
Reproduced in the museum.
