<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punitive Award</ENAMEX> Allowed
In Arbitration Cases
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIRST Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> has issued a decision that may change the way small-business owners write contracts. The ruling allows arbitrators in disputes to award punitive damages.
Small-business owners often include an arbitration clause in contracts to avoid costly litigation if a disagreement arises. An arbitrator usually awards compensatory damages if the other party is declared guilty, for example, of malicious or fraudulent conduct.
But the court said that just because the parties agreed to resolve their dispute through arbitration ``does not mean they should be required to surrender a legitimate claim to damages.''
Many attorneys believe the new ruling will encourage companies to seek punitive damages when they otherwise may have been satisfied with a settlement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Elkind</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> attorney with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaston & Snow</ENAMEX>, recommends that businesses now make sure they stipulate in contracts that punitive damages would be excluded from any arbitration judgment.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Circuit Court</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Appeals</ENAMEX> covers <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>, except <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>. Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rules otherwise, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elkind</ENAMEX> says he expects circuit courts in all 50 states to follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Circuit Court's</ENAMEX> ruling.
Little Guys Win One
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BEVERLY HILLS</ENAMEX> hardly seems the place for the little guy to get an even break, but some small-business owners recently struck a blow for equality in this ghetto of glitz.
The arena for this victory was the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> Chamber of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce.</ENAMEX> For decades, the chamber allocated voting power on a perfectly plutocratic basis: the more the company paid in dues, the more votes it got. As a result, a single large company had as many as 52 votes.
This situation didn't sit well with some small-business owners, particularly ones whose operations were located in the less tony parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yes</ENAMEX>, there are less tony parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills.</ENAMEX>) Some of these businesspeople felt their areas were being slighted by city government on such matters as police protection, street maintenance and public parking for customers.
``And the city was greatly influenced by the chamber'' on such matters, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Levi</ENAMEX>, a local businessman who led the effort to change the voting rules. The reformers' campaign included mass mailings to local residents, businesses and government officials.
As a result, the chamber recently changed its rules so that any single company can have a maximum of 10 votes. This brings <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> in line with many of the other 3,500 chambers of commerce around the country, which in the past decade or so have put a cap on voting power.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> and the others still have a way to go to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX>'s suggestion for business democracy: One firm gets one vote.

Gets Sexism Complaints
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERVICE Corps of Retired</ENAMEX> Executives, whose members are mostly men, wants to get savvier in advising women entrepreneurs.
The volunteer group of retirees, which is funded by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX>, has gotten complaints from women, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Daniels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SCORE</ENAMEX>'s executive director.
Women starting companies say that certain SCORE volunteers have asked such non-business questions as: ``What does your husband think of this? Who will watch the kids while you're working?'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniels</ENAMEX> says he's heard from one woman who appreciated business advice from a male volunteer, but disliked his addressing her as ``dear'' and ``honey.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCORE</ENAMEX>'s older volunteers tend to make these gaffes, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniels</ENAMEX> says, because they retired in the 1960s when women managers were scarce.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCORE</ENAMEX>'s younger members are attempting to enlighten their elders in various ways. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCORE</ENAMEX> is making a videotape to train members on do's and don't's of advising women. It also has prepared a checklist on interviewing skills and is trying to recruit more retired women executives.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Magazine</ENAMEX> Targets
Family Businesses
THE CROWDED magazine field will get yet another entry this November, with the debut of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Business.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLR Enterprises</ENAMEX> hopes for 100,000 initial circulation, and says it is prepared to put several million dollars into the venture. The monthly magazine has hired former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psychology</ENAMEX> Today editor in chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nessel</ENAMEX> as editor.
``It's high risk,'' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Zweig</ENAMEX>, publisher. One problem has been to convince potential advertisers that family business means more than mom-and-pop stores. And the recent problems of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venture magazine</ENAMEX> underscore how hard it can be to identify and exploit a niche that involves small-business readers.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zweig</ENAMEX> counters that family business is a big niche, with at least 1.5 million companies between $1 million and $100 million in annual revenue. And he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Business</ENAMEX> will capitalize on feelings of isolation felt by family business owners, whose problems include lack of a successor, estate taxes and family feuds.
The new publication comes at a time of increased interest in family business among major accounting firms and investment houses. And at least one new publication has already appeared. Last October, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcgraw-Hill</ENAMEX> began publishing a newsletter called Business Week Newsletter for Family Owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business.</ENAMEX>
