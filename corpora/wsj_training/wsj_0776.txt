The surprise resignations of two top economic government officials heaped more uncertainty on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s financial markets, which already have been laboring under worries about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s ailing economy.
``The last thing markets like is uncertainty,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Harwood</ENAMEX>, chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.G. Warburg & Co.</ENAMEX>, of the resignations of Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> and chief economic adviser Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX>. ``I think you'll see share prices go down, and sterling now is under something of a cloud.''
The pound immediately began to take a buffetting after the resignations were announced. In late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading, sterling stood at $1.5765, down from $1.6145 late Wednesday.
The British economy is hardly the picture of health these days. At 15%, base interest rates are the highest in eight years, and the 7.6% annual inflation rate is by far the highest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>. Unions are pressing demands for wage increases of more than 10% despite general belief that economic growth next year will be less than 2%.
Increasingly, the financial markets are reflecting the gloom. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 100-share index has dropped about 12% from its 1989 high of 2423.9 on Sept. 8. Yesterday, even before the resignations were announced, the index dove 32.5 points to close at 2129.4.
``We are expecting a recession,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Franklin</ENAMEX>, chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schroders</ENAMEX> investment bank. ``The only question is, how deep is it going to be? The outlook for corporate earnings is fairly bleak. It's quite likely we're going to get repeats'' of the mid-October market shocks.
Red ink already has begun to flow in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> market breaks of Oct. 13 and Oct. 16. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIT Holdings</ENAMEX>, the largest financer of traders in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> options and futures markets, said yesterday it will incur a second-half loss as a result of the market plunge. The company, which also will omit its second-half dividend, didn't specify the size. But company insiders estimated that the loss could approach the equivalent of $10 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Castleman</ENAMEX>, LIT chief executive, said in an interview that the loss stemmed from the default of three options traders who had bet on a price rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> shares before Oct. 13. The price plummeted after a proposed leveraged buy-out of the airline fell through.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIT Holdings</ENAMEX> shares plummeted 36 pence to close at 54 pence (85 cents), a 40% drop, on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s stock exchange.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s financial district are cushioning themselves for heavy blows. ``A lot more of our customers are staying until our 10 p.m. closing time,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Brown</ENAMEX>, managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corney & Barrow Restaurants Ltd.</ENAMEX>, which runs five tony wine bars in the district.
``There's a strong sense among the martini set that there's more {bad news} to come,'' asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Yates</ENAMEX>, chief investment officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell Asset Management</ENAMEX>. ``People in the stock market were very much <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s children -- very young and wealthy optimists. Now it's dawning on them that they can be non-wealthy.''
The malaise has created a nostalgic longing for the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s, before a rash of securities-firm mergers on the eve of the industry's deregulation in 1986. ``People come to us saying they'd like to be back where they were a few years ago, in a more collegial atmosphere, with less tension,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Waterhouse</ENAMEX>, managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanover Partners Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a financial district head-hunting firm.
But after trading losses in the mid-October market jolts here, many people will be lucky to have jobs at all, executives predict. The industry, which currently employs about 25,000 people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, has shed about 2,500 jobs over the past two years. ``I can see cuts of at least 20% more,'' says the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> office of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> firm.
The mergers and acquisitions market has been a saving grace for the industry, but uncertainties are beginning to mount even there. Intra-European takeovers are expected to continue at their brisk pace. But investment bankers say that stock market uncertainties in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> may cause many European companies to mark time before bidding for American companies, in the hope that share prices will come down.
``If prices in the States go down, industrial buyers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> have the opportunity of getting reasonable prices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois</ENAMEX> von <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurter</ENAMEX>, chief of Continential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M</ENAMEX>&A at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.</ENAMEX> But he adds: ``Everybody and his sister have opened up M&A shops. It's difficult to see that there's going to be enough business to go around. About eight firms will get the lion's share. At the others, there are going to be a lot of disappointments, after all those promises and all that big money that's been paid to people.''
It all adds up to a cold winter here. Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen D. Wheat</ENAMEX>, head of trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX>: ``People are just plain scared.''
One person who is past worrying about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s blues is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Hartley</ENAMEX>. Last summer, he chucked his 10-year career as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> stockbroker and headed for the mountains. He didn't stop until he got to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson Hole</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyo</ENAMEX>.
``I'm glad to be out,'' said the 32-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX> in a phone interview. ``The percentage of your day spent twiddling your thumbs got greater, and the work day kept getting longer. What am I doing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jackson</ENAMEX> Hole? Not a great deal. My wife and I will stay through the skiing season, or until the money runs out -- whichever comes first. But unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, out here I've never heard anybody blow a car horn in anger.
