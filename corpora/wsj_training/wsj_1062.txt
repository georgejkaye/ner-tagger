The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> called on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to attach the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill, but lawmakers seem likely to balk at the idea.
Earlier this month, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> endorsed stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> could pass quickly a ``clean'' bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm-Rudman act.
But now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill, on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> continues to work. ``If that doesn't happen, then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote,'' said press secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX>.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>, though, there doesn't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Archer</ENAMEX>, the ranking Republican on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> said, ``I don't see how we have the votes'' to place a capital-gains tax cut there.
Meanwhile, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains tax cut. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said he plans to hold a series of private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> meetings, mostly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Democrats, to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut.
The first meeting yesterday was with 10 Senate Democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax. According to some who attended, the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue. Issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending. The president was said to have been noncommittal.
