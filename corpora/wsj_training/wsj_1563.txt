IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments, there's probably no starting place better than ``beta.'' But investors better not ignore its limitations, either.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beta</ENAMEX> is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund. For any given move in the overall market, it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beta</ENAMEX> figures are widely available and easy to interpret. The beta of the broad market, typically defined as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s 500-stock index, is always 1.0. So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile, one at 1.5 is 50% more volatile, and so on.
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas. Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remember</ENAMEX>, though, that beta also has important limitations. ``Beta is only part of the risk in a stock,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Sharpe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> emeritus professor who developed the measure. ``There is risk that is not associated with market moves, and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that.''
In particular, beta doesn't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock. That ``business'' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks, but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beta</ENAMEX> is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer. In particular, the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down, but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired.
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Association of Individual Investors</ENAMEX> to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide.
``Our fear was people would look just at the beta {of a gold fund} and say here is an investment with very low risk,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Markese</ENAMEX>, director of research for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based group. ``In reality it's very volatile, but the movements are not because of market movements.
