The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> passed a bill requiring alternative long-distance operators to file their rates with federal regulators and disclose prices to customers upon request.
Under the measure, the companies must submit their rates to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX>, which could investigate whether the prices are ``unjust or unreasonable'' and could make companies justify their rates.
The bill, introduced by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Cooper</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>) and passed on a voice vote, is intended to end abuses by companies that provide assistance to callers placing collect, person-to-person and credit card calls from hotels, airports, hospitals and other institutions. It extends to all alternative-operator services restrictions that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> applied to five industry leaders earlier this year. Similar legislation is pending in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.
In February, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> required five companies to identify themselves to each caller and to place a sticker on the telephone or a placard near the phone with their name and a number to call for more information about the service. The agency had logged more than 2,000 customer complaints on the five companies. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> required those companies to disclose rates if callers ask, and ordered the companies to stop blocking consumers' calls to other carriers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Sprint</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Telecommunications Inc.</ENAMEX>
The five companies cited by the FCC were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Telecharge Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Telephone Services Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Payline Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore.</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telesphere Network Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oak Brook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill</ENAMEX>.
Alternative-operator services, which sprang up after the breakup of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell System</ENAMEX> in 1984, lease telephone lines from major carriers to sell operator assistance to various institutions, which get a commission of 20% or more. Some regularly charge rates that are 250% higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> rates.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> bill also calls for a nine-month study of operator service providers to decide whether further regulation is needed, and gives the companies 18 months to upgrade equipment to allow customers access to the long-distance carrier of their choice.
Regulators in several states have already restricted alternative-operator services, but that hasn't stopped their growth. Alternative companies have captured about 5% of the $12 billion market for operator-assisted calls.
