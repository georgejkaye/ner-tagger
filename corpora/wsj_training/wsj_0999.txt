HEALTH CLUBS gear up for a graying clientele.
Although their ads picture curvy young people in skimpy outfits, club owners know the future lies with the lumpier over-40 set. ``It's a misconception that physical fitness is something for the young and middle-aged,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Pacholik</ENAMEX>, sales manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Fitness</ENAMEX> club, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Diamond Bar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> About 10% to 15% of members at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Espre Center</ENAMEX> are elderly, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Williams</ENAMEX>, fitness consultant. ``Most want cardiovascular conditioning... the No. 1 way of reducing risk of heart disease.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Quality Clubs</ENAMEX>, which puts 1988 industry revenue at $5 billion, surveyed the health-conscious over-40 market and found that 43% exercise regularly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Hays</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Probody Fitness</ENAMEX>, notes an industry ``wash'' is in progress. ``Clubs need to be run like restaurants where every square foot makes a dollar,'' he says. Older people help profits by filling in ``downtime.'' He adds: ``The medical market and the fitness market parallel each other and are going to cross real soon.''
People on fixed incomes get a break at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Espre</ENAMEX>; over 55 wins a 45% discount at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anaheim Imperial Health Spa</ENAMEX>.
``HOT'' TOPAZ sparks regulator, jeweler concern over import of irradiated stones.
A committee of gem dealers investigates the source of some ``hot'' blue topaz stones recently reported by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> jewelry manufacturer. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, radiation limits are set and monitored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX>, which licenses reactors that process the topaz. The agency is working on licensing importers but doesn't currently monitor imports. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topaz</ENAMEX>, a translucent mineral that is often whitish when taken from the ground, can be turned blue by irradiation, which transforms it into a gemstone that looks like an aquamarine.
``The {stones} that were irradiated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> are safe,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hickey</ENAMEX>, chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NRC</ENAMEX> operations branch, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. ``We believe that the vast majority of imported material is safe. But there is a small risk that some were imported with high radiation levels.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hickey</ENAMEX> added that the stones found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> are thought to carry double the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> radiation limit, although he noted that double or even triple the U.S. limit is ``still in the range of safe levels.'' Some jewelers have Geiger counters to measure topaz radiation.
CAPITAL <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TRAVELS</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as 1992 unification nears.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston's Advent International</ENAMEX> raises $230 million from U.S. pension funds and other institutions to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Other venture capitalists are already there: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMG Patricof Group</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alan Patricof Associates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burr</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deleage & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX> have about $800 million to invest in European companies.
European venture capital funds total about $14 billion and are expected to continue growing 35% annually. Continentals believe that the strongest growth area will be southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> are most often mentioned as the future economic hot spots. Favored ventures include media, telecommunications and retailing. Most popular acquisition method: the leveraged buy-out.
Family-owned firms that need cash to grow are attractive, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Turner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Matuschka Gruppe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Munich</ENAMEX>.
AN AIDS DIRECTORY from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Foundation</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIDS Research</ENAMEX> rates and reviews educational materials. ``Learning AIDS'' lists films, pamphlets, brochures, videos and other educational data. The distributor is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.R. Bowker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
SUSPECT ``SALES'' ads are challenged by the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. The bureau found that only two of six <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> furniture stores could prove their presale prices were higher.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRACULA</ENAMEX>'S BUSY this time of year, but a visit to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transylvania</ENAMEX> castle is part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unitours</ENAMEX> trip in the spring, presumably the count's off-season.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RADIO MALAISE</ENAMEX> draws the ear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX>.
AM radio, which has been losing listeners to FM channels since the 1970s, approaches the 1990s with a diminished voice. But it may have a good listener in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> plans to hear a day of testimony Nov. 16 on the plight of AM radio. The commission believes that improving AM service would broaden listening selections and increase options for advertisers. The issues are also thought to be important to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s new chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Sikes</ENAMEX>, a former AM broadcaster in his native <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>.
The FM radio band, considered technically superior because it can carry stereo broadcasts, has cornered the airwaves for delivering music. AM stereo remains largely undeveloped because it lacks a uniform delivery system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Broadcasters</ENAMEX> in June adopted an agenda for revitalizing AM radio that includes, among other things, pursuing further FCC action on selecting an AM stereo standard and seeking a law requiring all stereo receivers to include AM stereo.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Listeners</ENAMEX> turned to radios run on batteries for news when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake and Hurricane Hugo cut power lines.
BRIEFS: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Healthcare magazine</ENAMEX> article says 40% of surveyed executives admitted falling asleep during formal presentations.... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee Co.</ENAMEX>, the jeans maker, celebrates its 100th anniversary with a hardcover yearbook featuring photos of its 10,000 employees.
