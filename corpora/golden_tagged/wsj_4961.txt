The mistrial in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>'s largest bank-fraud case has prompted a federal investigation of possible jury tampering, according to people familiar with the inquiry.
The mistrial, declared on Sept. 15 after the jury said it was hopelessly deadlocked, capped a six-month trial of seven men accused of defrauding savings and loan associations of more than $100 million. Federal prosecutors intend to retry the case.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of</ENAMEX> Investigation opened its inquiry into the suspected tampering shortly after the mistrial was declared by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Cummings</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lubbock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, say the individuals familiar with the investigation. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cummings</ENAMEX> also placed the jurors under a gag order, which has been challenged by lawyers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> Morning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">News</ENAMEX>.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> would neither confirm nor deny the inquiry.
The jury of 11 women and one man deliberated about 15 days before the mistrial was declared and indicated at least once that they were deadlocked in their deliberations on the 88-count indictment. The jury was understood to be split 11-1, with one juror reportedly refusing to discuss anything but an innocent verdict for all defendants on all charges.
Defense lawyers who could be reached for comment said they were unaware of the investigation.
``I certainly am unaware of any improprieties with respect to the jury and would hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> is not acting in response to the jury's not being able to reach a verdict,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl B. Wattley</ENAMEX>, who represents D.L. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny'' Faulkner</ENAMEX>, one of two real-estate developers charged in the bank-fraud case.
In other developments, U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Collins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, whose assistants prosecuted the case, filed court papers supporting Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cummings</ENAMEX>'s unusual gag order on the jurors.
``While I think it is a close question under the First Amendment, I do believe a trial judge has broad powers to limit pretrial publicity,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX> said.
Defendants' lawyers, who previously sought a change of venue from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> because of pretrial publicity, filed a response supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> Morning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">News</ENAMEX> in its request to have the gag order on the jurors lifted by the federal appeals court.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SHAREHOLDER</ENAMEX> SEEKS to hold Home Shopping executives personally liable for $100 million verdict.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, a state-court jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Clearwater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Shopping Network Inc.</ENAMEX> defamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE Corp.</ENAMEX>, when the company filed suit blaming sagging sales on phone foul-ups by
In its successful countersuit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX> said the video retailer's woes were because of uncontrolled growth, coupled with mismanagement and poor planning by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Shopping's</ENAMEX> chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy M. Speer</ENAMEX>, and its president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowell W. Paxson</ENAMEX>. The jury award hit Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paxson</ENAMEX> for $40 million each and assessed an additional $20 million against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Shopping.</ENAMEX>
Early this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Lloyd</ENAMEX>, a Home Shopping shareholder, sued in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chancery Court</ENAMEX> asking that Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paxson</ENAMEX> be forced to pay all the damages out of their own pockets -- not those of the company.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>, who owns 300 Home Shopping shares, seeks a court order that would block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Shopping's</ENAMEX> board from indemnifying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paxson</ENAMEX> for any of the damages and force them to pay the entire $100-million amount themselves.
``We don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Shopping Network</ENAMEX> should have to pay for it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Schneider Thomas</ENAMEX>, one of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s two attorneys. ``We think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paxson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Speer</ENAMEX> should pay for it.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nando Difilippo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Shopping's</ENAMEX> general counsel, called the suit ``ill-advised and premature,'' saying the company is confident the $100-million award will be vacated after post-trial motions or overturned on appeal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEY FEDERAL COURT</ENAMEX> ruling limits doctors' liability in AIDS cases.
A federal judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> ruled that doctors don't have to warn patients who previously had transfusions that they may have received blood tainted by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andree Walton Hoemke</ENAMEX>, who contracted AIDS after receiving a blood transfusion in 1981, sued her doctors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Hospital</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell Medical Center</ENAMEX> and the hospital's blood bank in 1988.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Wendel</ENAMEX>, a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mallet-Prevost</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colt & Mosle</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm that represented the doctors, said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoemke</ENAMEX>'s claim was novel.
``If the court had granted the plaintiff's theory, in effect hundreds of thousands of people in the city would have been told {by their doctors} of the risk of getting AIDS and there would have been pandemonium,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendel</ENAMEX> said. In addition, he said, ``You would have had thousands of lawsuits by people with AIDS who couldn't pay their medical costs.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Elizabeth Grayson</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Witherspoon & Grayson</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, who filed the suit, said she wanted the court to apply precedents set in cases involving intra-uterine devices. Judges have ruled that women who were harmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IUD</ENAMEX> birth-control devices should have been contacted by their physicians once the risks were discovered.
The suit against the hospital and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Blood Center</ENAMEX> is still pending.
U.S. LAW FIRMS reopen <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> offices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> deal-making is bouncing back in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> after the massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> in early June, and it hasn't taken long for law firms to reopen their Chinese offices.
``We go back when our clients go back,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Conroy</ENAMEX>, partner-in-charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baker & Mckenzie</ENAMEX>'s Asian practice.

The firm has seven lawyers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, ten in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and about 30 lawyers firmwide who represent foreign investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham & James</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, had one lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Wang</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> conflict. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang</ENAMEX> elected to stay, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitman Potter</ENAMEX>, a partner who left and returned by mid-June. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potter</ENAMEX> said the conflict had less of an impact on foreign enthusiam for investment than the Chinese government's tightening of its capital expenditures.
Lawyers from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skadden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arp</ENAMEX>, Slate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meagher & Flom</ENAMEX> have also returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> but only to a hotel or a client's office, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Handel Lee</ENAMEX>, an associate who returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> early this month.
Artillery fire broke the windows of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, where the firm had offices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX> officials say the building won't reopen until next spring.
Shattered windows notwithstanding, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> says business is ``getting back to where it was quite quickly.''
