Wall Street's big-time dealmakers and takeover stock speculators are grousing about a ``lack of catalysts.'' No, they're not talking about chemistry experiments.
``Catalysts,'' it seems, is a Wall Street euphemism for corporate raiders, those bad guys of the go-go'80s who used to put companies ``in play'' -- up for sale, in other words -- as easily as most corporate chief executives tee up a golf ball.
Though reviled by corporate managers, the raiders usually boosted the stock prices of their targets and generated big fees for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street.</ENAMEX> The raiders hired their own investment bankers; they also created business for investment bankers defending the raiders' targets and for those advising ``white knights'' who came to the rescue by making a friendly bid.
But corporate raiding isn't as profitable as it once was; the profession has fallen victim to a rising stock market and changes in tax and takeover laws and disclosure rules. The raiders, therefore, have moved on. Some are pursuing companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, or running the U.S. companies they bought. And one former raider, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul A. Bilzerian</ENAMEX>, is scheduled to be sentenced today in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> after being convicted on nine felony counts of securities and tax-law violations.
Decrying the lack of raiders, by any name, could easily offend important corporate investment-banking clients. So Wall Street's merger crowd isn't doing its grousing in public. ``There is a general absence of catalysts,'' the head of mergers and acquisitions at one major Wall Street investment banking firm complains in private. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX> is the only guy around who makes things happen,'' says the head of mergers at another firm, referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> billionaire who weighed in with offers for two airline companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX>, that resulted in auctions of both.
Wall Street's new code word for raiders is catching on, even among those who don't think the trend is bad. ``We are having a change in catalysts in the marketplace,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Wyser-Pratte</ENAMEX>, a takeover stock trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities.</ENAMEX> ``Whereas the raiders were the primary catalysts over the last few years, 1992 {when internal European trade barriers will fall} is becoming a far more important catalyst'' for takeovers, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyser-Pratte</ENAMEX>.
``The strategic buyers are replacing the financial engineers,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyser-Pratte</ENAMEX> says. Strategic buyers, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> parlance, are established companies that bid for other companies to expand into new markets or add new products. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>'s $3 billion bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble Co.</ENAMEX>'s agreement to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell Corp.</ENAMEX> for $1.3 billion in stock are just the latest examples of such transactions.
The raiders themselves, who bristle at that term and prefer to call themselves ``entrepreneurial investors,'' often cite the rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> stock prices as the main reason for their shifting focus. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asher Edelman</ENAMEX>, who now spends more than half his time in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, says that during the 1970s and early 1980s, ``you could find an asset-rich company and buy your first stock at as little as a third of the real breakup value of the company. That simply doesn't exist now.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX>, in a telephone interview from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, also says that changing attitudes in the U.S. toward corporate raiders have caused him to prospect in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. ``I think the view of what a catalyst does is different from what it was before,'' he says. ``I think that psychology makes it more difficult to do a deal. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, it's viewed as overleveraging the economy and creates political difficulty. From my point of view, I couldn't lose a proxy battle in the late'70s and early'80s, and now I can't win one.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Boone Pickens Jr.</ENAMEX>, who forced restructurings at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> by bidding for those oil companies, has cast his net overseas. He now owns 20.2% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito Manufacturing Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>; as its largest shareholder, he's demanding representation on its board. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> is resisting, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> has announced plans to increase his stake to 26%, he maintains ``there's nothing hostile'' about his investment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> says he swore off hostile takeovers more than a year ago because the cost was too high and the rewards too low. ``I didn't like all of the wear and tear in that game,'' he says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> also asserts that even such mainstays of U.S. corporate life as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> have joined the ranks of corporate raiders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, he maintains, became a raider last week when it said it wants to buy 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX>, despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s opposition. ``I see other companies trying to do exactly what we did'' with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX>' Mesa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petroleum Corp.</ENAMEX> and its successor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesa Limited Partnership</ENAMEX>, he says.
In addition to high stock prices and political hostility, legal and financial developments have made it more difficult and more expensive to launch a successful raid in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, investment bankers and takeover lawyers say. By themselves, none of the changes is fatal, but together they have slowed down the takeover business.
Vital among the changes is the 1986 tax-law overhaul, which tightened the rules governing taxes on asset sales. Previously, a raider could avoid paying capital gains taxes on profits from breaking up a target company.
``The'86'86 tax law has meaningfully increased the cost for the financial raider,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Fleischer</ENAMEX>, a merger law specialist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fried</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson</ENAMEX>. ``That has a very major inhibiting effect.''
Even Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX>, who claims to be unaffected by other changes, agrees that the new tax law has hurt. He calls it ``double taxation'' on buying and selling the same asset, and notes that most European countries don't have such tax laws.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evolving</ENAMEX> takeover laws and court decisions, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX>, have also made takeover bidding more expensive by requiring bidders to line up financing in advance. That means raiders must pay multimillion-dollar commitment fees to lenders. ``Today, to be taken seriously by a target company, you have to show the color of your money by paying very substantial commitment fees,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nusbaum</ENAMEX>, a merger-law specialist with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willkie Farr & Gallagher</ENAMEX>.
Depending on the type of financing and the size of the loans involved, commitment fees can range from 0.5% to 1.5% of the loan amount. On a $1 billion loan, the commitment fee alone could be $15 million.
Until recently, a raider could count on recovering his costs -- and reaping a substantial profit -- by quietly buying a stake of 5% or more in a target company before announcing a bid. Even if the raider failed to buy the company, he could usually sell his shares at a higher price to the ultimate buyer.
But the federal government has tightened rules that require that a bidder stop buying at $15 million of stock and seek antitrust clearance to buy more. Once that clearance becomes public knowledge, as it usually does, the stock price of the target company rises, reducing the raider's potential profits. (The only exception under current rules is for partnerships in which no individual or company has a stake of more than 50%.)
Finally, financing of all kinds has become more difficult. The market for high-yield, low-rated junk bonds is in disarray, and investment bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> has been less aggressive in backing highly leveraged bidders.
As a result, the game of raiding has been increasingly left to billionaires such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> and oil heir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Getty</ENAMEX> -- and there aren't too many of those.
