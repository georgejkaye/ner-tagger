<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert D. Kaplan</ENAMEX> (``Correcting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>'s Ethiopian Disaster,'' editorial page, Sept. 7) obviously labors under the misapprehension that events around the world take place only in the straitjacketed framework of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> politics and in consequence of the argument between liberals and conservatives in this country. To say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> was up for grabs by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> ``because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>, appalled at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX>'s human-rights abuses, had refused to continue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX>'s Ethiopia policy'' is simply absurd. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> went over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> because that was where President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> wanted to take it. He tried mightily to do so during 1975 and 1976, which coincidentally were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>-Kissinger years in this country, but never quite managed, both because he was not then fully in charge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> and because the Soviets weren't yet convinced that he was a solid bet.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> was able to achieve his goal only after he shot down Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teferi Bante</ENAMEX>, the head of state chosen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> military junta, and a dozen or so of his associates at a meeting on Feb. 3, 1977, that had been arranged to discuss differences between the two men. Well before that, Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> had given up on what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX> calls ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX>'s Ethiopia policy.'' The budget proposal submitted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> administration in its closing days carried no provision for further military assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>. After Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX>'s bloody takeover, which not coincidentally he accompanied with a speech violently denouncing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> administration simply ratified its predecessor's decision and slapped a human-rights rationale onto the political one. When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> did get around to breaking off with the U.S. in April 1977 (when he expelled most U.S. diplomatic personnel and denounced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement</ENAMEX>), the reason involved was not the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> cutoff of military assistance but the closure of the U.S. military communications station in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asmara</ENAMEX>, a move planned since early in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> administration.
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> famine-relief aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>, a small number of officials in the Reagan administration did in fact try in 1982 and 1983 to cut off supplies channeled to Ethiopia through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic Relief Services</ENAMEX>, but did not succeed. When the administration, much to its credit, launched its massive relief program for Ethiopia in the fall of 1984, after the drought that struck earlier that year, it did so principally in the humanitarian belief that people should not be left to starve no matter what the politics of their government. I should add that quite a number of people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> -- both senior Reagan officials and liberals -- entertained for some time the unrealistic hope that the U.S. program would influence Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX>'s policies.
