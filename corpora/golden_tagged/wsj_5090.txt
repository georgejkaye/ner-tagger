Your Aug. 31 article on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s requirement that airlines install ``bomb detectors'' and that this in some measure might avert events such as the bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 perpetuates the myth that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> disaster resulted from technical inadequacies. This is something that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> would like to have the public believe, but which is contrary to any facts that have emerged.
Only 21 pieces of baggage loaded at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> were X-rayed, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>'s request this was done at such high speed that it was a ``gesture,'' not an inspection. It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>'s business to know what security measures Pan Am employed, and nothing has emerged to suggest the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was not fully aware, despite both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> knowing for more than a month that there was an attack planned against a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> flight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> spokesman stated that the airline could not use screening methods that require more than six seconds per bag, implying that any use of these new machines will be in a highly selective manner. The best machines will not work if not used, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has mandated that the machines be installed, not that they be used. The 270 people who died at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> died because someone mysteriously decided not to use the available methods. No machine will protect against that.
