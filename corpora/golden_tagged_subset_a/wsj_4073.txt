<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup Co.</ENAMEX> is expected to announce today the appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Edward Glover</ENAMEX> as president of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Europe</ENAMEX> division, which accounts for about two-thirds of the diversified food company's international operations.
In the newly created position, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glover</ENAMEX> will manage the previously announced restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> believes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> is critical to its survival in the world food market and has been expanding its operations there in anticipation of a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> market in 1992. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glover</ENAMEX> said he will focus on ``strategy instead of pure tactics'' and doesn't expect to sell any of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s European operations in the near future.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glover</ENAMEX> was president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nabisco Brands International</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> until Aug. 31. He oversaw this summer's $2.5 billion sale of virtually all of the unit's operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSN S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> as part of the diversified tobacco company's debt-reduction plan. In an earlier position, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glover</ENAMEX> was responsible for pruning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nabisco</ENAMEX>'s Canadian operations.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glover</ENAMEX>, a longtime friend of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Argabright</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell International</ENAMEX>, said his parting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> was amicable. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> is shedding a lot of people as part of the divestiture process,'' he said. ``It was crystal clear back in October that this would be the probable outcome.
