When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Yetnikoff</ENAMEX>, the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX>, last month told producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was about to make a $3.4 billion bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> and needed someone to run the studio, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> jumped at the chance.
Within two days, he was on his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> to meet with top brass at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>. And before the week was out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> had offered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and his partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX>, the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business. Not only that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also agreed to give them a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s future profits and buy their company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX>, for $200 million, almost 40% more than the market value of the company.
There was just one sticking point: The two had a prior commitment. Just seven months earlier, they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> for which they had just produced the smash hit ``Batman.'' But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> figured that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Ross</ENAMEX>, would empathize and let the producers go, knowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> offer was ``the culmination of a life's work.''
He figured wrong. Last week, following fruitless settlement talks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, now merging with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX>, filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Superior Court</ENAMEX> against both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> promptly countersued, charging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> movie business. The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides: As one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> executive puts it, ``It's World War <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>.''
That two successful producers who aren't all that well known outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business. And they are a very odd team in any case. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> was raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> and educated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> is a high-school dropout who came to fame as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbra Streisand</ENAMEX>'s hairdresser. Yet, they are far and away the most prolific producers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. And despite their share of duds, they make movies that make money.
That is a skill <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> badly needs -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is loath to lose.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> had a good summer with ``Ghostbusters II'' and ``When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Met Sally</ENAMEX>,'' rivals such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Pictures</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> have been thrashing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> at the box office. After five years of management turmoil, with four different studio heads, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> sorely needs a stable, savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> aren't universally loved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> but they are well connected. Their stock in trade as ``executive producers'' is sniffing out hot properties, locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them. Sometimes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flashdance</ENAMEX>,'' or buy rights to a best seller such as ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Purple.</ENAMEX>'' It falls to others to do the writing, directing and producing.
With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX>'s ``Rainman,'' for instance, Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber and Peters</ENAMEX> had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production, but their names still appear in big letters on the credits, and they are inevitably associated with its success. Sometimes, as with ``Batman,'' the pair really do make the film. In that case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> acquired the rights in 1979, nursed the movie through a dozen scripts, and were on the set in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production.
``They're the best production talent around,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian De Palma</ENAMEX>, beholden to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> for hiring him to direct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> movie of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Wolfe</ENAMEX>'s novel ``Bonfire of the Vanities.'' On that film, which is to start shooting in a few months, ``they've been very much involved, hiring talent and discussing the development of the script. And when you're making a movie this big, you need all the help you can get,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Palma</ENAMEX> adds. ``I wish they were around 24 hours a day.''
And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives blame Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>'s and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>'s lack of involvement in ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caddyshack II</ENAMEX>'' for casting and production problems and the film's ultimate dismal failure. ``We've had a few bombs,'' admits Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>. ``But by and large this company has only been profitable.'' He says his company's prowess at packaging and marketing ``is why we'll be good at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. We practically ran our own studio.'' Longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> associates describe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> as the intellectual powerhouse of the two, a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> is a major piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> manpower who has really earned his success,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bookman</ENAMEX>, an agent at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative Artists Agency</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Johnson</ENAMEX>, the producer of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainman</ENAMEX>,'' chimes in: ``He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority.... It's no accident that they've been able to develop such successful material.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, has fewer fans in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully. He gets better reviews as a creative whiz, an enthusiast, an idea man. He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbra Streisand</ENAMEX> made him famous. He cut her hair. He lived with her. He came to produce her records and her movies -- ``A Star Is Born'' and ``The Main Event.''
Thrice married but now single, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Basinger</ENAMEX> during the making of ``Batman.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>, by contrast, has been married to one woman for more than 20 years. But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences, they make the perfect ``good cop, bad cop'' team, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> associates say. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> is the bright, sympathetic guy when you're doing a deal,'' says one agent. ``If there's a problem, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> disappears, and all of a sudden <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon</ENAMEX> shows up.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> rub many people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> the wrong way. Producers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Simpson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Bruckheimer</ENAMEX>, who shepherded ``Flashdance'' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie, bristle when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> take credit for the film. Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX>: ``The script was unreadable. We reinvented it. We are the producers of that movie. They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit'' as executive producers.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Birnbaum</ENAMEX>, an executive who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> in the early 1980s, left to take a job as head of production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Artists</ENAMEX> studio, they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop, including ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainman</ENAMEX>'' and ``Batman.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> acknowledges that and says it's not unlike the situation he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> are in with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>. ``I was upset with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger</ENAMEX>, I fumpered and schmumpered,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>. ``But he wanted to pursue his own dream, and he went.''
Still, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birnbaum</ENAMEX> says his relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> was ``one of the most successful I've had in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>.'' The two ``have a wonderful chemistry -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon</ENAMEX> is very impulsive, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> is very compulsive,'' adds Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birnbaum</ENAMEX>, who is now head of production at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s 20th <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Fox Film Co.</ENAMEX> ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX> will come barreling into a room, say he's got a great idea, and be gone. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific....''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birnbaum</ENAMEX> recalls that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dian Fossey</ENAMEX>, which became ``Gorillas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mist.</ENAMEX>'' He says, ``Within a few weeks, we made deals with the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rwanda</ENAMEX> and everyone who had ever met or talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dian Fossey</ENAMEX>. I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> even made some deals with the gorillas.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> was working on a competing film, but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>.
More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> beat out a dozen other producers, reportedly including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX>, for rights to the life story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chico Mendes</ENAMEX>, the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> rain forest. Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber and Peters</ENAMEX> assiduously courted the man's widow for months, showing her a tape of ``Gorillas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mist</ENAMEX>'' to impress her with the quality of their work. Money helped, too. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, they paid more than $1 million for the rights. (The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband's followers. Some of the money will go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chico Mendes Foundation</ENAMEX>, but it isn't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest.)
It's hardly astonishing (given the men's track record) that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> wants Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>. But it is puzzling to some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> executives that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> rushed to hire them without clearing up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> situation first. Some note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and letting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> stay on to fulfill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> contract. But though ``people in town may ask why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber needs Peters</ENAMEX>, it's good to have a partner, and obviously the chemistry works,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Tisch</ENAMEX>, a producer who once worked for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>. ``This business isn't about personalities at the end of the day -- its about whether the ink is red or black. In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon</ENAMEX>, the ink has been very, very black.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> got his start in the movie business at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> two decades ago. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recruited</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York University</ENAMEX>'s MBA program, he rose within two years to head of production, overseeing such films as ``The Way We Were,'' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taxi Driver</ENAMEX>,'' ``Tommy'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shampoo.</ENAMEX>'' In 1976, he teamed up with record producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Bogart</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Casablanca Records</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Filmworks</ENAMEX> -- later called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram Pictures</ENAMEX> -- where they produced such hits as as ``The Deep,'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midnight Express.</ENAMEX>''
In 1980, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> got together with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>, by then a successful producer in his own right, after the death of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bogart</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> produced a number of hits for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and others, their record wasn't always so impressive. Among their clinkers were ``The Legend of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billie Jean</ENAMEX>,'' ``Visionquest,'' ``Clue'' and ``Clan of the Cave Bear.'' And the failures make it possible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates. The studio says it stuck with them ``even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner.</ENAMEX>''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> replies that ``this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goliath</ENAMEX>, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>, trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> maintain that executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse, but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> never felt threatened until they linked up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>. ``From the beginning, {they} knew we had a goal and a dream,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>. On a number of occasions, he adds, he tried to get Warner to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> outright. ``They always listened, but they never acted,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says.
In 1987, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> contributed their company's assets in exchange for a 28% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris Entertainment</ENAMEX>, a small-fry TV production company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Sugarman</ENAMEX>. In July a year later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreed to release the producers from their old contract when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> made a $100 million offer to buy 25% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> planned to run the nearly dormant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> studio, and the two even tried to interest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX>' President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Semel</ENAMEX> in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> plan collapsed just two weeks later. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> say they got a look at the books and balked at the price. Their relationship with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> soured shortly thereafter. Last May, he sold his 24% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris</ENAMEX> to a passive Australian investor and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barris</ENAMEX> was renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> Meanwhile, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> had agreed to extend their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract.
The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind, both financially and in terms of creative freedom. But it paled by comparison to what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> was to offer last month: the chance, at last, to run a major studio, about $50 million in deferred compensation, up to 10% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s future cash flow, 8% of the future appreciation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s market value, and annual salaries of $2.7 million for each. The producers' 28% share of publicly held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> would net them an additional $50 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $42 million last year. And earnings have been erratic. In the the latest quarter, thanks in part to ``Batman,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> earned $5.8 million, or 50 cents a share, compared to a loss of $6.8 million, or 62 cents a share, in last year's quarter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> stock, which traded as low as $6 a share last year, closed yesterday at $16.625.
The two sides now are accusing each other of lying. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> claim they have an oral agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise. But in affidavits filed yesterday in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> court, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX> and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> deny that such an oral agreement was ever made. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, in its court filings, calls it ``a piece of fiction created for this litigation.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> in his affidavit acknowledges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreed to release the producers last year to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> but says that situation was altogether different. For one thing, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX>, the producers requested a release in advance. Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber Peters</ENAMEX> pictures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> wasn't as strong as it is now. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> itself was in negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> over certain movie and other rights, and it was ``in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s interest to accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber and Peters</ENAMEX> by permitting them to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> executives,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> said in his affidavit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> obviously doesn't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> go off to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. At the very least, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>. During settlement talks, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> demanded such things as cable TV rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> movies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s interest in the studio it jointly owns with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, according to executives involved in the talks. In any settlement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> have locked up for the next few years, notably sequels to ``Batman.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> offer before taking it up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>. And they say there are plenty of precedents in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> for letting people out of contracts. The last time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> was looking for a studio chief, they note, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> released producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Puttnam</ENAMEX> from his contract, then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. In his affidavit filed yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> indicated he isn't buying any such argument: ``If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> succeeds here, no written contract in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> will be worth the paper it's written on.
