Arco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> agreed to purchase two chemicals businesses from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX> for $220 million.
Arco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> will acquire plants and other assets involved in production of propylene glycols -- which are used in making personal care products such as shampoo -- and urethane polyols, used in making polyurethane foam found in furniture cushioning and other products. The transaction is subject to governmental reviews.
Arco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> is 83%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based oil company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbide</ENAMEX>, a chemical company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, said it will record a third-quarter gain on the sale of $62 million. But it said the gain will be largely offset by a charge of $55 million in the same quarter from a write-down in its polysilicon business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbide</ENAMEX> said the write-down recognizes the true value of the business ``in the current competitive environment.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polysilicon</ENAMEX> is a raw material used in making integrated circuits.
