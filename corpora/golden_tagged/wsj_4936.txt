The challenge of managing a high-growth, innovative or creative industry has not been handled well by many of the start-up companies of the 1980s. But even one of their elders is finding that the techniques that helped get it to the top are different from those needed to stay there.
Out of the clutter of the computer revolution of the 1970s came <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX>, which rose to the powerful number two slot by developing a management system modeled after one often used at research institutions like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>.
Under the system, which continues to this day, every employee is part of a group. Each group has a leader, a project and a budget. The group is free to spend its budget with virtually no upper-management control, provided it stays within its allotment. Every once in a while, a group produces something wondrous and its budget is increased. The groups that don't produce anything of value are left alone for a long while. If they still don't produce, they are disbanded and their people join other expanding groups. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s approach is: Don't get organized. Don't manage. Don't control. Just let it happen.
This decentralized management system has kept the company far ahead of the pack in terms of product development, which continues apace. A byproduct, however, is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> employs large numbers of less than essential people. The personnel costs are considerable, but the returns no longer justify them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inevitably</ENAMEX>, the hands-off management system that produced unparalleled growth and creativity also has produced a country-club atmosphere. Many employees, instead of fighting their way through the current tough times, are just putting in their time until tough times are over (whenever that may be ). The current challenge is what to do now that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s spectacular growth curve is leveling off. Earnings for the past four quarters were down 19%, 12%, 11% and 16%, respectively, from the same periods a year earlier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> is trying hard to cut costs without violating its commitments to its creative staff. A hiring frost has turned into a deep freeze. But at the height of the company's ascent, managers over-hired by about 50% (out of a total world-wide work force of 125,000). Attrition can not bring such vast numbers down to size in any reasonable period.
Last month, management set a goal of reducing administrative jobs by 10,000 in 24 months. The danger of this strategy is that top-notch workers, unwilling to forgo promotions into administration, will quit. All salaries have been capped, and there's a hold on upper-level stock options as well. Early-retirement packages have not yet been offered, but that strategy often weakens an organization considerably, since management can't make the offer only to those it wants to leave.
Finally, thousands of manufacturing people have been sent to sales. This tactic is seldom effective; industrial musical chairs does not cut costs, nor does it produce new business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, this move emphasizes another weak link in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s management philosophy: allowing the hands-off management system to work its way into the sales organization. What was right for managing creative growth turned out to be very wrong for sales management, where no innovative approach was needed. In sales, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> model (get the best people and work'em by the numbers) -- not the laid-back model -- works best.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s products have been outstanding, they have not been matched with a sales team of equal quality. So long as the products stood out so much that they practically sold themselves, this wasn't much of a problem. But as the competition edges closer and closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s level, lack of expertise in basic sales management is becoming ever more apparent. And that can not be remedied overnight.
The prescription is maddeningly simple. The late chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parade Magazine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur ``Red'' Motley</ENAMEX> -- who coined the phrase ``Nothing Happens Till Somebody Sells Something'' -- set forth the formula for success in sales in just 15 words: ``Know your customer. Know your product. See a lot of people. Ask all to buy.''
Meeting this challenge is well beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s current sales management group. Under ideal conditions, it would take a minimum of 18 months and more like 36 months to produce an effective selling team.
At some point, something must give. The deficiency in sales management is just about an insurmountable obstacle. But there is a greater lesson from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s recent travails: Despite the success of a particular management technique, a company must always have the flexibility to alter that technique as conditions change. The proof of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s high-growth strategy now awaits the outcome of its struggle to deal with a major decline.

Swiss companies acted legally in helping Libya build a chemical plant that the U.S. claimed could make poison gas, the Swiss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Prosecutor's Office</ENAMEX> said.
A furor arose over the plant late last year when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> said it had evidence the factory was about to produce chemical weapons. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s investigation was touched off by a West German prosecutor's request to probe links of Swiss companies to the project.
Several Swiss companies did provide financing and equipment for the plant, the prosecutor's office said. But it said the companies didn't violate laws that bar military exports to areas of conflict or crisis.
The prosecutor's office said it was dropping its investigation.
Two members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nobel Literature</ENAMEX> Prize selection committee quit over the body's refusal to speak out against threats to British author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salman Rushdie</ENAMEX>, and a third quit over an undisclosed matter, but the committee is refusing to let them go. The two quitting over the Rushdie matter were novelists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerstin Ekman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lars Gyllensten</ENAMEX>; the other resigning member was poet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werner Aspenstrom</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sture Allen</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Letters</ENAMEX>, said: ``Members serve for life so we can not grant their resignation requests.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gogh</ENAMEX> may have died broke, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> has budgeted $12.5 million for an exhibition of his paintings to mark the 100th anniversary of his death next year. The exhibit will fill two museums and will include some 40 oil paintings and 120 sketches from abroad. ``It is probably the last time these works will be brought together, because it is complicated to bring them together and traveling is not good for paintings,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frits Becht</ENAMEX>, managing director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Van</ENAMEX> Gogh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1990 Foundation</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peru</ENAMEX>'s news agency quoted President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Garcia</ENAMEX> as saying his country would be willing to lift its four-year-old halt on debt payments to the International Monetary Fund if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peru</ENAMEX> received large new loans. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> reportedly said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peru</ENAMEX> could resume interest payments if it won a $500 million standby loan plus an $800 million bridging loan to cover its debts to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>. Later, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lima</ENAMEX>, armed critics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> invaded the offices of Agence <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Presse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Press</ENAMEX> International but left after painting slogans on the walls.
``I don't want to say it's an industry, but almost,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tamar Leshem</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX>'s independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office for Human Rights.</ENAMEX> The almost-industry: Israeli couples traveling by plane or ship to Cyprus to be united by civil marriage. The reason: In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>, marriages may be performed only by religious authorities -- Jewish, Moslem, Christian or Druse -- and not everybody likes that idea. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cyprus</ENAMEX>'s capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicosia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deputy</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.S. Christopoulos</ENAMEX> estimated he has married Israelis at some 230 civil weddings over the past three years.
Long in the throes of armed conflict, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eritrea</ENAMEX> is once again coming to grips with another woe: drought. Having received only 20% of expected rainfall in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">June</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> province of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> now is seeing a major failure of its current crops. Preliminary estimates by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eritrean Relief Association</ENAMEX> indicate that 1.6 million people in the province will need 359,000 metric tons of emergency food to ward off famine over the coming year.
A growing number of Europeans see the electric car as the vehicle of the future -- if major problems can be resolved.
``We aim to introduce several million electric-driven cars by the end of this century,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> Transport <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Commissioner Karel van Miert</ENAMEX> said while attending a seminar of electric-transport experts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bruges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>.
Fans of electric cars say they are clean, quiet and economical. A disadvantage, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Porter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Electricity Generating Board</ENAMEX>, is ``their range, which is typically only 40 miles. After that, they must be recharged for eight hours.'' Another drawback is that they cost more to build than gasoline-powered cars.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaston Maggetto</ENAMEX>, professor of electrical engineering at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flemish Free University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, said the way to get the cost down is ``political action, because the pollution-free aspect of the electric car is an advantage to the whole community, not to the individual.''
South African censors relaxed a three-year ban on a biography of jailed black nationalist leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Benson</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Mandela</ENAMEX>,'' censored immediately after publication in 1986, will be available for study at university libraries but still can't be released for purchase or lending.... <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX>'s government-owned phone company told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly</ENAMEX> investigators it made an additional $59.7 million over the past seven years from its pay phones that don't return change.
