Financial problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> prompted more factoring companies to tell manufacturers to stop shipping merchandise to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores</ENAMEX> units.
In a related development, some off-price retailers said they have been approached by apparel makers trying to unload merchandise originally intended for sale to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Talcott Corp.</ENAMEX>, a major factoring company that does business with many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seventh Avenue</ENAMEX> apparel companies, said Friday it had instructed vendors not to ship to stores owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Kenyon</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> aren't behind in their bills, but he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> was ``concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> wouldn't be able to meet their interest payments.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> officials didn't return calls for comment.
As reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> are facing a liquidity crunch caused by high debt levels resulting from their acquisition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based real-estate developer and retailer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> operate nine department-store chains, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stern</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan Marsh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham & Straus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazarus</ENAMEX>.
Factoring companies buy retail receivables from apparel makers and, in many cases, act as their credit managers. As such, they exert considerable influence in the way apparel companies conduct their business. Last week, another big factoring company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heller Financial Inc.</ENAMEX>, also told its vendors to halt shipments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>-owned stores.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenyon</ENAMEX> said Congress substantially cut its credit lines to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> in mid-August because of concern about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s financial situation. ``We have had meetings with them trying to get better information, but we weren't satisfied,'' he said. The credit lines were suspended last week.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> receives the $250 million loan it is hoping to get from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenyon</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would probably allow vendors to make October shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX>. But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s credit lines won't be increased ``until they can show us more'' financial data.
As concern about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau spread</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s garment district, most apparel makers simply refused to discuss their business relationships with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stores. But judging by the comments from a few apparel makers, many companies apparently have halted shipments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied and Federated</ENAMEX> stores.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBI Merchandise Industries</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> maker of photo albums, said it stopped shipping to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> clients on Friday after receiving a stop-shipment order from its factor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays American Corp.</ENAMEX>, according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBI</ENAMEX> vice president. ``When I called to break the news to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stern</ENAMEX>'s buyer, he told me that he had received a lot of {cancellation} calls from other manufacturers,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MBI</ENAMEX> executive said.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays American</ENAMEX> declined to comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stern</ENAMEX>'s officials referred calls seeking comment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>.
It was also evident last Friday that some manufacturers weren't waiting to hear good news from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and were seeking to sell goods to other retailers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burlington Coat Factory</ENAMEX>, a big off-price apparel retailer based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burlington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, was ``flooded with calls'' within the last week from manufacturers looking to sell goods, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe Millstein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burlington</ENAMEX> chairman. ``Our buyers have been besieged with offers for all types of clothing across the board,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millstein</ENAMEX> said.
Off-price retailers specialize in the sale of brand-name and designer apparel at discount prices. Apparel makers typically turn to them when they have excess inventory or merchandise they need to sell late in the season. Most department stores have already ordered most of their fall and winter merchandise.
