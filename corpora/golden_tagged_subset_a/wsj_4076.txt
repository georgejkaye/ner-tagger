<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Price</ENAMEX>, acknowledging criticism of his leadership of the struggling company, plans to relinquish the position of chief executive officer soon.
But the computer company's announcement that it would undertake a widespread search for a successor raised eyebrows, as its president and chief operating officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Perlman</ENAMEX>, is widely viewed as the obvious choice. ``Inefficient cultures die hard,'' said one Wall Street securities analyst.
A committee of the board intends to recommend a new chief executive within three months, the company said. Asked why the board simply didn't name Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> as the CEO-designate, a company spokesman said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> considers ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> clearly as the leading candidate'' but that external candidates will be considered as a matter of due diligence. The spokesman said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> believed the search process would ``reinforce'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX>'s position.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> called the search ``a reasonable, prudent thing to do'' and said he didn't consider it a slight to his qualifications.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Perlman</ENAMEX> is the obvious choice to lead the company into a more focused, more profitable future,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Wise</ENAMEX>, a computer-industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX> ``Anything that would accelerate that process would be a positive.''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> closed at $18.375, down 12.5 cents.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> today is expected to announce completion of the sale of its disk-drive business, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imprimis</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagate Technology Inc.</ENAMEX> for $450 million in cash and securities. Under terms of the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagate</ENAMEX> is to pay $250 million in cash, a $50 million note and about $150 million in newly issued shares for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imprimis</ENAMEX>, which last year had more than $1 billion in revenue. Trained as a lawyer, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> enhanced his reputation as the company's ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fixit</ENAMEX>'' by reviving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Imprimis</ENAMEX> after it had heavy losses in the mid-1980s. The sale gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> much-needed cash. It also leaves the company with only one major hardware business -- the manufacture of large and mid-size computers -- along with a variety of computer services operations.
In disclosing his intention to step aside, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> said he was ``well aware of the criticism being leveled at the management of the company,'' adding that ``the chief executive is rightfully the focal point of that criticism. By taking this action, both the board and myself can put this matter in an objective framework and remove it from speculation and rumor.''
During Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX>'s three years of leadership, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> had losses of hundreds of millions of dollars as it shed businesses while seeking profitable niches in the tumultuous computer industry. Two months ago, the 59-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> swept aside rumors that he planned to retire soon and pass the reins to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX>, who is 51. ``They're incorrect,'' he said at the time.
Although he will give up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEO</ENAMEX>'s job, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> said he intends to remain chairman of the company, which he joined as a mathematician 28 years ago. He was named to his current posts in 1986 as the hand-picked successor to founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William C. Norris</ENAMEX>, who relinquished power after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> went into a tailspin.
Last December, the board transferred the title of president from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX>. In August, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> took on the role of chief financial officer as well.
At their meeting Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> directors also elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Marshall</ENAMEX>, retired vice chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX>, to the board. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Hofstad</ENAMEX>, former chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Land O'Lakes Inc.</ENAMEX>, a dairy concern.
