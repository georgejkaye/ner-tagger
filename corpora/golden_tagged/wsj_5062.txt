Japanese shipbuilders, encouraged by a recent recovery in the industry, said they agreed to end an anti-recession cartel they formed in 1987.
The agreement to dismantle the cartel at the end of September came at a meeting of the steering committee of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shipbuilders' Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> officials said the group relayed the decision to the government's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair Trade Commission</ENAMEX>, which has been considering whether to allow the shipbuilders to keep the cartel in force.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> shipbuilders had been faltering because of the inroads of competitors from other Asian countries, and because of the yen's sharp appreciation that made it more expensive for foreign shipowners to have vessels built in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
But the economies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other major industrial countries have continued to expand, and led to the recovery in the shipping and shipbuilding industries.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Ship Exporters' Association</ENAMEX> said export contracts for 20 ships weighing 380,250 gross tons were signed in August, up 2.7% from a year ago.
