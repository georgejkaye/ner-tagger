The fee that Medicare patients must pay for hospital care under the insurance plan for the elderly will rise to $592 in 1990 from $560 this year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Services</ENAMEX> announced.
Under the insurance plan for catastrophic illness enacted last year, a Medicare beneficiary must pay the $592 deductible for the first day of hospital care each year and Medicare pays for the balance of hospital expenses. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is expected to repeal or significantly reduce the coverage, making hospital benefits less generous next year.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Financing Administration</ENAMEX> estimates that 7.6 million Medicare beneficiaries will enter hospitals next year and pay the higher deductible. The fee is adjusted each year to reflect changes in hospital costs.
