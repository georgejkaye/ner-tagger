From the Sept. 30-Oct. 4 issue of The Economist:
What defeated General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aoun</ENAMEX> was not only the weight of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syrian</ENAMEX> army. The weight of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>'s history was also against him; and it is a history <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> is in danger of repeating.
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, and however unfairly, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration. Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palestinians</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> is being remade by demography. In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims. Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> will neither share power with all these Arabs nor, says its present prime minister, redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland.
By not choosing one of these options, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israelis</ENAMEX> will condemn themselves, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maronites</ENAMEX> did, to perpetual war with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muslims</ENAMEX> in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state. Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maronites</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut. But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Aoun</ENAMEX>.
