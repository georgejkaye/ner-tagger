<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> signed an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX> for cable rights to the Winter Olympics in 1992 and 1994, giving Turner's new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> channel a programming boost and helping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> defray a small portion of its own costs.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> deal would be the first time a broadcast network has sold a portion of exclusive Olympics programming to a basic-cable rival. It is likely to raise questions of saturation, and the pact also may draw criticism from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> affiliates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> alone will air up to 120 hours of Winter Games, 27% more time than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> network aired for the disappointing 1988 Winter Games. Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> will have 50 hours of its own daytime events, plus 50 hours of late-night reruns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s prime-time coverage.
The cable deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX>, the company that put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> into takeover play several years ago, will give CBS at least $50 million total from Turner for the two Winter Games.
That is a tiny sum given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s rights fees, which total $543 million. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> may get another $10 million by handling all national ad sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> and sharing the proceeds with the cable partner.
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will pay $243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albertville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, and $300 million for the 1994 Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lillehammer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>. The Olympic Games had occurred every four years, but after 1992 the Summer and Winter Games will alternate every two years, starting with winter 1994, then summer 1996, and so forth.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip A. Jones</ENAMEX>, immediate past chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> affiliates board, said stations must accept that some cable programming will be necessary to offset <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s huge costs. He praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> deal for protecting affiliates by giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> ad sales.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>-Turner pact could upset some affiliates. The saturation issue will become important to local stations if the Winter Games lack drama and if the American team does poorly, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>. Another snag may be one of time-zone considerations.
Virtually all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s prime-time coverage will be taped events that happened earlier in the day; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will have daytime coverage only on weekends. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> will cover events from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. and thereby include contests as they happen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> therefore will be careful to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> only the events that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> won't want to air, on tape, later in the evening, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> Sports President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal H. Pilson</ENAMEX>. Indeed, the onetime adversaries turned partners haven't yet worked out exactly which events <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> will give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terence F. Mcguirk</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Sports</ENAMEX>, said he's confident that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> will end up with ``a full cross-section'' of attractive events, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> has first choice.
