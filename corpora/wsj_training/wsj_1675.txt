The government will try to sell all the real estate managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Asset Disposition Association</ENAMEX> in one fell swoop, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Seidman</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FADA</ENAMEX> real-estate package, with an asking price of $428 million, is comprised of 150 properties in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>. It includes apartments, shopping centers, office buildings and undeveloped land.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> is chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX>, established to sell or merge the nation's hundreds of insolvent savings-and-loan associations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX>, created by this year's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX> bailout legislation, is trying to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX>'s network of offices separately. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX>, which holds problem assets of thrifts that were closed before the bailout legislation was enacted, is being liquidated.
The properties held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> won't be sold piecemeal, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> said in a speech before Southern Methodist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Business School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>. ``You need to buy the entire lot,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seidman</ENAMEX> said, ``so get out your checkbooks.
