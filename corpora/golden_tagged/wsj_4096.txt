<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip B. Miller</ENAMEX> has a flair for the dramatic.
In his six years at the department store owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer has revived its fortunes by wooing famous fashion designers, installing flashy merchandise displays and improving service. An energetic supporter of the arts, he also marched on stage recently as a spear carrier in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lyric Opera</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> production of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guiseppe Verdi</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aida</ENAMEX>.''
Now, the 51-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> is vying for an even bigger role: He seeks to lead a management buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX>'s.
The 24-store Field's chain is one of several, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> put on the auction block to try to thwart Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s $21.14 billion takeover bid.
For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>, engineering a buy-out bid is a daunting challenge. He must raise about $1 billion to make a credible offer, but lenders are skittish these days because several retail buy-outs financed with high-yield junk bonds have faltered. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> may also find himself in a bidding war, possibly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard Department Stores Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">May Department Stores Co.</ENAMEX> or others.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> says he hasn't yet worked out details on financing or even how many managers would be involved beyond his 14-member executive committee. But he acknowledges the difficulties he is likely to face.
``What we need,'' he says, ``is a strategic partner who wants to make a major equity investment in the business so we are not reliant on junk bonds and the business isn't bought on a highly leveraged basis.... It will not work as a purely financial bid.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s strength lies in merchandising. He is widely credited with turning around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX>'s and giving it back a reputation for living up to its legendary motto, ``Give the Lady What She Wants.''
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX>'s commands a leading 14% share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> market. In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>, it operates stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>. It rang up sales last year of $1.02 billion and operating profit of $83 million.
``He took a very tired store that was losing market share in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and restored the traditions that made it great,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Niedermaier</ENAMEX>, president of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based designer and manufacturer of retail fixtures and displays.
By the early 1980s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field</ENAMEX>'s, which in its heyday helped pioneer such practices as home deliveries, tea and dining service and a liberal exchange policy, had slipped badly. Its performance was erratic and it became a perennial takeover target, turning eventually to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> in 1982 to help fend off the overtures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX>. The following year, the British company recruited Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neiman Marcus</ENAMEX>, where he had been president.
Once at Field's, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> concentrated on restoring Field's posh heritage. He upgraded the merchandise, bringing to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> collections by top designers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian Lacroix</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Abboud</ENAMEX>, and he didn't spare funds in refurbishing the stores. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s moved in across the street from the Water Tower Place store on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan Avenue</ENAMEX>, for instance, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> was prepared. He had already spent $10 million renovating the store, with the result that sales at Field's Water Tower store rose by double-digit percentages.
One misstep was his buying six former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gimbel</ENAMEX>'s stores to expand the Field's presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>. Less than two years later, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> closed two of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> stores because sales failed to meet expectations.
Now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> is in the midst of a $110 million renovation that he vows will transform his mammoth flagship store on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">State Street</ENAMEX> into the ``the finest store in the world.'' The project, which is one-third completed, is clearly close to his heart. When the revamped men's floor opened recently, he took a personal tour and ordered a change in the way ties were knotted on mannequins displaying shirts and jackets. He insisted on a slimmer, more ``with-it'' four-in-hand knot instead of the more traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Windsor</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>, an immaculate dresser who favors double-breasted suits, wasn't always a fashion maven. The son of a telephone-company manager, he once dreamed of becoming a surgeon. But he switched his major in college to business, then dropped out of school to support his wife and young child. He wound up working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamburgers</ENAMEX>, a men's clothing store in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, eventually moving on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord & Taylor</ENAMEX> and then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nieman Marcus</ENAMEX>.
``He pushes himself harder than anyone and demands a lot of himself,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Witkin</ENAMEX>, an executive vice president who followed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> to Field's from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neiman Marcus</ENAMEX>. ``Part of the demand he's made on himself is to develop the highest level of style and taste that's possible.
