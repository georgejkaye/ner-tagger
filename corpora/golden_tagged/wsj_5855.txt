Jean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Leny</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Framatome S.A.</ENAMEX>, a French nuclear power engineering concern, said the company will invest more than $50 million in a new U.S. joint venture that will provide high-technology products and services for U.S. nuclear power plants.
At a news conference here, officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Framatome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babcock & Wilcox</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdermott International Inc.</ENAMEX>, announced the formation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B&W Nuclear Service Co.</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lynchburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>
Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babcock & Wilcox</ENAMEX> declined to say how much capital the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> company would provide, but they acknowledged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Framatome</ENAMEX> is, in effect, buying ``a piece'' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdermott</ENAMEX> affiliate, which has contracts with a number of utilities to provide nuclear power plant engineering services.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babcock & Wilcox</ENAMEX> already has an agreement wth <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Framatome</ENAMEX> and other companies in the French nuclear power industry to market fuels for light-water reactor power plants through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B&W Fuel Co.</ENAMEX>, which was formed in 1987.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles W. Pryor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jr.</ENAMEX>, vice president and general manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babcock & Wilcox</ENAMEX> nuclear power division, will be president of the new nuclear service company. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B&W</ENAMEX> plans future cooperative efforts with French and West German companies to develop and market commercial reactors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>.
This cooperation will involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B&W</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Power International</ENAMEX>, a joint venture that Framatome set up last April with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KWU Group of Siemens AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pryor</ENAMEX> said the partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Framatome in B&W Nuclear Service Co.</ENAMEX> will involve shared investments in new products and technologies, coordinated research and development programs, and use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Framatome</ENAMEX>'s experience in the construction and servicing of nuclear power plants.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pryor</ENAMEX> said 54 U.S. utilities currently are operating 113 licensed nuclear power plants with more than 100,000 megawatts of installed capacity and another 10 plants are under construction.
``We estimate that over $2.5 billion was spent last year on purchased nuclear services,'' he said, adding that about $1 billion of that was spent for the type of services ``for which our new company will compete.''
Several other U.S. companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Combustion Engineering Inc.</ENAMEX>, as well as several engineering companies and numerous medium-sized specialty concerns, also are competing for contracts to provide products and technical services required in the operation of commercial nuclear power plants.
