<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birmingham Steel Corp.</ENAMEX>, one of the nation's biggest minimills, accepted a $30-a-share offer from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbert Corp.</ENAMEX>, a closely held concern controlled by one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, company's outside directors.
The transaction is valued at about $525 million, including assumption of about $100 million in debt and fees.
The offer is subject to evaluation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX>, which has been directed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX> board to solicit other offers and determine within 45 to 60 days whether the $30-a-share offer is fair. Should a higher offer by a third party be made and accepted, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birmingham</ENAMEX> has agreed to reimburse Harbert $9 million for expenses.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbert</ENAMEX> offer was recommended by a special committee of outside directors. ``We believe the proposed merger transaction provides stockholders with an opportunity to maximize the value of their shares at this time, with a reasonable expectation that they should be able to obtain at least $30 a share,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Mandell</ENAMEX> dewindt, chairman of the special committee.
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX> surged $4.50 a share to close at $29.125.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbert</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, is involved in construction, real estate development and oil and gas exploration. It is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Harbert III</ENAMEX>, who is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX> director and who owns, with affiliates, about 568,700 shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, which went public in 1985, had about an average of 12.4 million shares outstanding in the year ended June 30.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbert</ENAMEX> said it would contribute as much as $75 million in equity, and has received firm commitments for $100 million subordinated bridge financing from Bear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX> and $350 million in senior credit facilities from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Bank</ENAMEX>.
Although the transaction doesn't involve current management, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbert</ENAMEX> said it would invite top managers and employees to invest in the new company. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harbert</ENAMEX> also said it plans to keep management and won't get involved in the day-to-day operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>'s management has been credited with acquiring and turning around a half dozen ailing minimills.
Should the acquisition be completed, as expected, during the last two weeks of calendar 1989, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX> would be the third major minimill to go private in less than two years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern Steel & Wire Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Steel Corp.</ENAMEX> both went private in leveraged buy-outs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tumazos</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX>, said managements at minimills have been disappointed with the market's treatment of their stocks. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birmingham Steel</ENAMEX> withdrew a public offering last year because the company wasn't satisfied with the price. And in spite of management's record, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX> hasn't received the same market welcome as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nucor Corp.</ENAMEX>, considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> darling of minimills.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Harbert</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harbert</ENAMEX>'s son and a vice president of the holding company, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX> would help balance the company's other operations and provide a steady earnings stream.
However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tumazos</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, which provides steel bar used in construction, was hurt by heavy rains this spring that damped construction and caused a 6% drop in spot bar prices. Such softness, he said, is expected to continue through the year, at the same time minimills are adding capacity.
``The fact that a spring rain can cause prices to fall 6% to 8% suggests that the demand-supply balance isn't too stable,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, for example, had been planning to build a flat-rolled sheet minimill in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, along with other partners. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Harbert</ENAMEX> said that construction program would be reviewed.
