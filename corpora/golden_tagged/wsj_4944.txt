<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secomerica Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secom Co.</ENAMEX>, said it reached an agreement to acquire home health-care services provider, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMSS Inc.</ENAMEX>, for $50 a share, or about $250 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secomerica</ENAMEX>, which said its parent will finance the transaction with cash as well as probably ``some borrowings,'' is expected to begin a tender offer later this week for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMSS</ENAMEX> shares outstanding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMSS</ENAMEX> specializes in the in-home administration of intravenous medications, nutrients and fluids, which Secomerica described as ``the fastest growing segment'' of the entire health-care services industry.
``There are two very powerful currents driving'' the business, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael S. Kaye</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Secomerica</ENAMEX>, said in an interview.
The first, he said, is the nationwide effort to cut health-care costs while maintaining quality. The second is the simple fact that ``people feel more comfortable at home,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaye</ENAMEX> said. ``Nobody likes to be in an institution. That's a very powerful theme, and it's gaining even more momentum.''
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMSS</ENAMEX> has grown 60% annually for the past four years. For the six months ended June 30, the company's net income soared 76.9% to $2.3 million from $1.3 million. Revenue climbed 59.5% to $23.6 million from $14.8 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Ross</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMSS</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive, described the arrangement as ``an excellent fit,'' noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secomerica</ENAMEX> already provides commercial and residential security and emergency medical services. He also said in an interview that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMSS</ENAMEX> should continue to ``significantly outperform the market'' over the next few years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMSS</ENAMEX>'s stock will probably be de-listed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite Index within a month or so, when it becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Secomerica</ENAMEX>. In national over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMSS</ENAMEX> shares closed Friday at $34.75 a share, up $1.
