<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX>, the company's first new car franchise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edsel</ENAMEX> was unveiled in 1957, now will share Edsel's fate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> said yesterday it will halt imports of the Merkur Scorpio, a $28,000 luxury sedan built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> dealers -- as opposed to new models such as Taurus or Escort, which are sold under existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> divisions.
The move to halt imports -- announced 29 years and 11 months to the day after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Ford</ENAMEX> II declared that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edsel</ENAMEX> division and its gawky car would be scrapped -- kills the four-year-old Merkur brand in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market. It will continue to be sold in the European market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX>'s death isn't nearly as costly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> as was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edsel</ENAMEX> debacle, because Merkur was a relatively low-budget project with limited sales goals. Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX>'s demise is a setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> at a time when the company's image as the U.S. auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain.
The No. 2 auto maker's new Thunderbird and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> Cougar models haven't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s trucks are losing ground to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> rivals. This fall, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> introduced only one new product: A restyled version of its hulking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> Town Car luxury model.
The demise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> (pronounced mare-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">COOR</ENAMEX>) comes after a September in which 670 Merkur dealers managed to sell only 93 Scorpios. Total Merkur sales for the first nine months dropped 46% from a year ago to just 6,320 cars.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> isn't the only European luxury brand having problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> The Japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such European makes as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>, which at least have clear brand images. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX>, as an import on domestic car lots, suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> was originally aimed at enticing into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln-Mercury</ENAMEX> dealerships the kind of young, affluent buyers who wouldn't be caught dead in a Town Car -- a vehicle so bargelike that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> is staging a press event next month linking the Town Car's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norfolk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>
But the brand had trouble from the start. The first Merkur, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xr4ti</ENAMEX>, went on sale in early 1985. The sporty coupe foundered in part because American buyers didn't go for the car's unusual double-wing rear spoiler.
In May 1987, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> began importing the Scorpio sedan from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> to sell next to a redesigned Xr4ti in showrooms. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials said they expected the two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Merkurs</ENAMEX> would sell about 15,000 cars a year, and in 1988 they reached that goal, as sales hit 15,261 cars.
It was downhill from there, however. One major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark, which began less than a year after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX>'s 1985 launch. As the West German currency rose, so did Merkur prices.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> cars also suffered from spotty quality, some dealers say. ``It was like a comedy of errors,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin J. ``Hoot'' Mcinerney</ENAMEX>, a big dealer whose Star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, sold more Xr4ti's  than any other dealership. But by the third quarter of 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scorpios</ENAMEX> had a high satisfaction rating in internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> studies, a spokesman said.
Apparently, however, the improvement came too late. Last fall, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> announced it would discontinue the Xr4ti in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> at the end of the 1989 model year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> said then it would keep the Scorpio. This year, Scorpio sales plummeted, and at the current sales pace it would take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> 242 days to sell off the current Scorpio inventory of about 4,600 cars.
