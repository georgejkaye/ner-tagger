<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>'s sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> canned foods business to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp Venture Capital</ENAMEX> is being revamped to comply with federal limits on banks' ownership of non-financial companies, according to people familiar with the transaction.
The change is being made as a result of concerns expressed by the staff of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX>, which applies the provisions of federal banking laws to proposed individual transactions, the same people said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> unit was expected to purchase the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> business for about $1.48 billion in a leveraged buy-out as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX>'s sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX>'s fresh-fruit and processed-foods divisions. If it occurs, the sale will pare down <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">RJR</ENAMEX>'s debt after its record $25 billion LBO earlier this year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX>
Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>'s equity interest in the purchase is being reduced, and another financial buyer, possibly another leveraged buy-out fund, is likely to step in to help make the purchase, according to one person familiar with the sale. One participant said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>'s equity percentage may be reduced to around 25% from a higher level that hasn't been disclosed.
The identity of the additional equity investors couldn't be learned. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> is being advised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>, which could supply funds to assist in completing the transaction.
Although some people involved in the transaction were hopeful that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> would receive the same price tag for the business, at least one said the price might have to be reduced as a result of the change. There also remained a chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> might yank the property off the auction block and postpone any sale.
Some people involved said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> staff vetoed the proposed sale as part of an informal procedure in which transactions are submitted, informally and unofficially, for inspection by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> staff. These people said the veto may signal a tougher attitude by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> staff members toward bank equity investments in leveraged buy-outs.
``I think they finally just took a different stance,'' said one person familiar with the sale talks. ``I think they let the banks do a lot for a long time and finally said no.''
Banks, which usually supply more than half of the debt for most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lbos</ENAMEX>, haven't generally been big equity investors in them. Federal bank law bars commercial banks regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> from owning more than 5% of a non-financial company. Banks can own nearly 25% in non-voting stock. And they can own nearly 50% of a small business. One person said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> may be tightening the rules for small-business exemptions.
A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> wouldn't confirm its intervention in the transaction, and said there has been ``no change'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s orientation to banks' participation as equity investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX>.
Nevertheless, tougher interpretation of existing bank laws wouldn't be implausible in light of the current turmoil in the junk-bond market. Prices of such high-interest, high-risk bonds, which help finance Lbos, have tumbled in the past week as a result of financial woes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>, a Canadian retailer choking on debt.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> said: ``We've had a few complications, but that's normal for a complex transaction. As each complication comes up, we work it out. The deal is still under discussion and we think it's going to get done.'' A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said she could confirm the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> statement but couldn't elaborate.
Depending on how it is worked out, the snag in the transaction could tarnish the outcome of asset sales that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> is making to try to pay down some of the debt incurred in the buy-out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> received a higher-than-expected price for five European food businesses this summer; but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del</ENAMEX> Monte sale is coming in under earlier optimistic hopes for proceeds of $3 billion or more.
During a lengthy auction, bidders for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> business were first asked for bids for the entire company, and then later were asked for bids for the two major pieces. Two weeks ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> announced the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX>'s fresh-fruit business for $875 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polly Peck International PLC</ENAMEX>.
The proposed canned-foods price tag would mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> would obtain $2.35 billion for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del</ENAMEX> Monte businesses. Anything less in the canned-foods sale would increase the amount by which the sale fell short of earlier hopes. However, the canned-foods sale won't include the Canadian and Latin American businesses, leaving open the chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> might yet come closer to its target with further asset sales.
