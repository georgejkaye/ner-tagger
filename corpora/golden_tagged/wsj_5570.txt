September has been an emotional month for that modest but growing tribe of La-la-landers who do not flee down the freeways at the sound of a high C, even when it comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Ewing</ENAMEX>, who is singing ``Tosca'' here in a stylish new production.
Alternating with an ambitious but confusing version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurt Weill/Bertolt Brecht ``Mahagonny</ENAMEX>,'' staged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Miller</ENAMEX>, ``Tosca'' is just one of several events the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Music Center</ENAMEX> is presenting in its 25th anniversary season. Home to the opera, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> Philharmonic and the Taper theater group, as well as Western ``pied-a-terre'' for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Joffrey Ballet</ENAMEX>, the Center plans to celebrate its milestone next week with a glittery awards program.
But while this is a lofty moment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angelenos</ENAMEX>, another cultural monolith is disappearing into thin air. Next Wednesday, we will be saying goodbye to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">L.A.</ENAMEX>'s only commercial classical music station, as KFAC-FM changes its format to rock under a new ownership.
Letter writers and talk-show callers, in a cathartic but futile tirade, have vilified one of the selling partners, who happened to be the daughter-in-law of the late violinist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jascha Heifetz</ENAMEX>. It was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heifetz</ENAMEX> whose solo performance inaugurated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Music Center</ENAMEX> in 1964, an irony that has not escaped the press.
No gloom, though, intruded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Music Center Opera</ENAMEX>'s glitzy, $600-a-person opening night gala, which attracted people whose names aren't generally associated with opera. They included the fallen former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> (whose family foundation recently donated $320,000), and the generously proportioned oil man and investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX>, who said ``what really made it work'' for him were the supertitles.
On stage, what made ``Tosca'' work was a willingness to take risks with this familiar opera. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gunter</ENAMEX> designed geometric sets that were unusually spare and disquieting and worked well with the restrained interpretation by Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX>, a sometime mezzo, here singing her first Tosca. She was directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Judge</ENAMEX>, replacing Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Hall</ENAMEX>, who presumably is not so devoted to the singer's career now that they are no longer a couple.
The role of the prima donna who murders a lecherous police chief to save her lover's life and finally hurls herself from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castel Sant'Angelo</ENAMEX> has been sung by many of this century's great sopranos, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Caniglia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Callas</ENAMEX> and, more recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hildegard Behrens</ENAMEX>.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX>'s considerably smaller vocal gifts include neither the range nor the power of, say, Callas. But what the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> native lacked in vocal grandeur, she made up with an acting style that was often compelling in its limited way. She telegraphed panic with a frozen look, fear with a suddenly raised eyebrow, treachery with a thinly veiled sneer.
In ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tosca</ENAMEX>,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX> was greatly helped by having the action set at the turn of this century, at least a hundred years later than Puccini intended. The updating, complete with slinky costumes, accentuated her pleasantly non-diva-like figure. Though he sang energetically, tenor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Shicoff</ENAMEX> seemed unconvincing as the object of so much passion. He could have used some of the charisma of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justino Diaz</ENAMEX>, who played Scarpia. The company's artistic consultant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Placido Domingo</ENAMEX> -- a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario</ENAMEX> -- led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra</ENAMEX>, at times too vigorously.
Although its plot, too, depends in part on sexual energy, there wasn't a spark in sight in the English-language version of ``The Rise and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fall</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City of Mahagonny</ENAMEX>,'' the apocalyptic anti-opera set in a mythical 1920-ish American city of sin.
Written during the waning days of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Weimar Republic</ENAMEX>, ``Mahagonny'' is a nightmare of capitalism and personal freedom run amok in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, which its authors hadn't yet visited. The amoral Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Begbick</ENAMEX> and her band of law-breaking opportunists establish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahoganny</ENAMEX>, a town of fantasy where they plan to bilk the bored but well-heeled.
As staged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Miller</ENAMEX> -- who directed the company's hauntingly beautiful ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tristan</ENAMEX> und  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isolde</ENAMEX>'' designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hockney</ENAMEX> two seasons ago -- the opera was transported from its usual German cabaret-like setting to one representing the early days of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. Not that you would know this from the ugly stark unit set that moved around a bit from time to time, featuring one fake palm and a cast that didn't change costumes. Why was the lighting in sepia tones instead of black and white, reminiscent of old movies? As an attempt to link decadent, dying Weimar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A.</ENAMEX> pool culture it was an astonishing failure from a talented director.
With the exception of the energetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvellee Cariaga</ENAMEX> as Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Begbick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Mack</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>, who gorges himself to death on raw meat, the cast delivered its lines without emotion or energy. Especially disappointing was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Steiger</ENAMEX> as Jenny, the sweet Southern girl turned lady of the evening. It was hard to see why lumberjack Jimmy, played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bachlund</ENAMEX>, would fall for this plump and stolid-looking daughter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rod Steiger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claire Bloom</ENAMEX>. Maybe the lightweight Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX> could give her some dieting tips.
