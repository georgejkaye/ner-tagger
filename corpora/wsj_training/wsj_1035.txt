<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consolidated Freightways Inc.</ENAMEX> reported a 77% drop in third-quarter net income, citing expected losses in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emery Worldwide</ENAMEX> shipping business.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Menlo Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, company said net was $7.4 million, or 22 cents a share, down from $32.3 million, or 86 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue totaled $1.01 billion, a 43% increase from $704.4 million, reflecting the company's acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emery</ENAMEX> earlier this year.
Profit also suffered because of ``intense'' discounting in its long-haul trucking business, the company said.
Analysts had expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consolidated</ENAMEX> to post a slim profit, and the company's stock was down only 25 cents to $30.25 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday. ``They have to continue to tighten their belts,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Kloner</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>
