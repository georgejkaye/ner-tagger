<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> announced a Bush administration goal of cutting the nation's homeless population in half by 1992.
In prepared remarks for a bi-regional conference of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interagency Council</ENAMEX> on the Homeless, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> said his strategy calls for giving priority to families and the mentally ill who are homeless, closing welfare hotels and providing transitional and permanent homes to families along with supportive services, such as counseling and job training, if needed. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> didn't, however, offer specific details on how to accomplish the goal.
``It's hard to be specific, not because we don't know what we are going to do, but we're waiting to see how it all rolls out,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anna Kondratas</ENAMEX>, assistant secretary for community planning and development for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>.
One proposal in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kemp</ENAMEX> plan would allow nonprofit groups that are not tax-supported to buy foreclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> homes for a 10% discount, as some tax-supported nonprofit groups have done. He also promised to continue efforts to simplify the ``complex mess'' of bureaucratic barriers that has hindered federal homeless assistance.
