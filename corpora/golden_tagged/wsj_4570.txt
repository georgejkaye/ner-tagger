Does the air in your office make you nauseous? Try sitting next to a plant. Better yet, sit next to a fan pointed at a plant.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Administration</ENAMEX> says plants can clean up fumes from paint, furniture and cigarettes that make office workers woozy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B.C. Wolverton</ENAMEX>, a scientist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stennis Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss.</ENAMEX>, calls plants a ``promising, economical solution to indoor air pollution.''
``Plants take substances out of the air through the tiny openings in their leaves,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolverton</ENAMEX> said. He added that plant leaves, roots and soil bacteria also remove ``trace levels of toxic vapors.''
After studying plants for two years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolverton</ENAMEX> concluded that philodendron, spider plant and golden pothos are especially good at removing formaldehyde, which is released in offices from foam insulation and particle-board products. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flowering</ENAMEX> plants, such as gerbera daisy and crysanthemum, work well against benzene, which is released from inks, paints and plastics.
Bamboo palm, peace lily, ficus, mass cane, mother-in-law's tongue, English ivy and Chinese evergreen also make good air purifiers, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolverton</ENAMEX>'s study.
To clear rooms of cigarette smoke and organic solvents, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolverton</ENAMEX> suggests installing a planter with a fan at the bottom. The fan would pull polluted air into a mixture of potting soil and activated carbon. The carbon filter would absorb the air pollutants and hold them until the plant's roots and micro-organisms in the soil could feast on them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> studies plants because it wants to find ways to purify air in space stations. The agency hopes someday to build habitats, maybe on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, where plants, bugs and animals would regulate the atmosphere without the help of oxygen and heavy machinery from earth. Plants may play a role on the planned earth-orbiting space station. One experiment, called the salad machine, will try to grow fresh vegetables on the station as food for the astronauts.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Landscape Contractors of America</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falls Church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, trade association that kicked in $25,000 for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> study, has a shorter-term interest: selling more plants. The trade group represents contractors who install and maintain plants in offices.
The trade group said it backed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolverton</ENAMEX>'s work because his research ``was not communicated as thoroughly as it might have been.'' They co-sponsored a press conference trumpeting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolverton</ENAMEX>'s work, and they sent each member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> -- and a bunch of reporters, too -- a green plant labeled ``clean air machine.''
But the landscapers still have some public-relations hurdles to overcome. ``Some skeptics are labeling the use of plants for solving indoor air-pollution problems as voodoo science, witchcraft, pipedreams,'' the trade group admitted.
