<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette Co.</ENAMEX> reached an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s attorney general and three environmental groups to remove a potentially cancer-causing chemical from its widely used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liquid Paper</ENAMEX> typing correction products and to pay $300,000 in fines and legal costs.
The formal settlement, signed yesterday, calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> to eliminate trichloroethylene, a chemical used to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liquid Paper</ENAMEX> dry faster.
The agreement was concluded under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s Proposition 65, a 1986 voter initiative that includes broad labeling requirements for products containing any of about 400 suspected carcinogenic chemicals. According to the parties, it is the first case in which a manufacturer has agreed to eliminate potential carcinogens from a product after a public complaint filed under the law.
A lawyer acting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> said the company quickly agreed to make the change ``to eliminate any confusion or concern about the product.'' The lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michele Corash</ENAMEX>, added that ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liquid Paper</ENAMEX> is safe.''
While the settlement requires changing the formulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liquid Paper</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> market only, it's likely that trichloroethylene will be removed from the product in all markets, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corash</ENAMEX> said.
