<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Seung Kon</ENAMEX> and his wife flit back and forth among the displays of wine, wild pine mushrooms and Swiss chocolates at the glitzy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotte World Department</ENAMEX> store here. The gift they want to buy Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX>'s business associates for the traditional Harvest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon Festival</ENAMEX> must convey proper respect.
So they pass by the wine, mushrooms and chocolates for something truly special: a presentation box of nine Spam cans. ``It may be a bit heavy to deliver,'' says the 58-year-old executive for a major lighting maker, ``but it is an impressive gift.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spam</ENAMEX>? Those canned loaves of ``chopped pork shoulder meat with ham meat added and salt, water, sugar, sodium nitrite,'' fully cooked and ready to eat? The same luncheon product that most Americans associate with grade-school lunch-box sandwiches, Army life and an old Monty Python comedy routine?
The very stuff.
In a country where more grocery shelf space is devoted to canned luncheon meats than to soy sauce, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spam</ENAMEX> is not only one of the most popular imported American products (ranking right up there with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> Fried <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicken</ENAMEX>), it's also considered one of the classiest.
Many Spam fans here fry it with kimchi, a peppery fermented cabbage dish, or roll it up with rice and seaweed for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spam</ENAMEX> sushi known as kimpap. Nothing fishy about that, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Crane</ENAMEX>, director of international marketing and sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A. Hormel & Co.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minn.</ENAMEX>, company that makes the product. ``Koreans,'' he points out, ``love Spam.''
Indeed, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> is the largest market for canned luncheon meat, and it is the world's fastest-growing market for it. Thus, competition among producers is fierce.
The authorized maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spam</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>, blessed with a license from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hormel</ENAMEX>, is Cheil Sugar, a major food producer. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spam</ENAMEX> faces intense competition from local Spam knockoffs, including one cooked up by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheil</ENAMEX> itself, as well as a brand made by the Japanese-South Korean conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotte</ENAMEX>, brazenly called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lospam</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> still isn't very big on protecting trademarks.)
In 1987, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> dropped its barriers to imported canned pork products, European makers swarmed in with such cut-price brands as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plumrose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tulip</ENAMEX>. Now that the invaders have grabbed more than half the market, the South Korean government has launched an investigation into alleged ``dumping'' of Danish government-subsidized canned pork.
Then there is ``gray-market'' Spam, brought in from American supermarket warehouses by the shipload without the permission of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hormel</ENAMEX>. The people who do this, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hormel</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crane</ENAMEX>, ``see it as an easy way to make a dollar. I could make a million myself. It's an easy sale.'' He adds that entrepreneurs, mostly Korean-Americans, often call him asking to buy Spam by the shipping container. ``We tell them we can't do that,'' he says. ``They say,'I won't tell anyone.' And when I still refuse, they say,'Does your boss know you are turning me down?' ``
The market is further saturated by black-market Spam flowing out of the Army bases. Although no one knows how much is diverted, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> is sure there is a problem because its stores sell about 447,000 pounds a year to some 60,000 authorized patrons -- which means that these customers, few of whom will even admit to eating Spam, annually fork down an average of 7.5 pounds each. In a survey conducted two years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheil</ENAMEX> estimated that 80% of the Spam on Army bases was finding its way to the black market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Koreans</ENAMEX>' love affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spam</ENAMEX> started, of course, in the early 1950s during the Korean War, when American troops slogging up and down the peninsula began sharing it with the locals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spam</ENAMEX> has been a staple in the PX ever since, cheering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> troops that are still kept here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Koreans</ENAMEX>, known to consider dog meat a delicacy, now eat Spam not because they are poor, but because they are no longer poor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheil Sugar</ENAMEX> has positioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spam</ENAMEX>, which retails for 2100 won, or about $3.12, a can, as an upscale product, playing on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s trend-setting image. The luncheon meat is part of a boom in American consumer products that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Klein</ENAMEX> fashions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baskin-Robbins</ENAMEX> ice cream and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s hamburgers.
``In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spam</ENAMEX> is consumed by the rich because of its image as a foreign brand,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ha Dae Jung</ENAMEX>, manager of processed meat products for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheil</ENAMEX>. ``Koreans know Spam is representative of U.S. products.''
That's why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chun Hyun Joon</ENAMEX>, a burly construction company manager, has bought 11 gift sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spam</ENAMEX>. He explains that such a gift will easily appease upset residents near a construction site. ``And,'' he notes, ``kids love it.''
All the attention could prove to be too much of a good thing, however. Cheil created much of the demand with a huge advertising campaign in 1987 after it signed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hormel</ENAMEX> agreement, which expires in 1992. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheil</ENAMEX>, a unit of the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samsung Group</ENAMEX>, had been after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hormel</ENAMEX> since 1978.) The company spent 30% of sales -- an estimated $1.3 million -- for ads on television, in women's magazines and in subway cars. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ha</ENAMEX> says he expected to sell about 150 tons of Spam the first year; he sold 500 tons. And in 1988, volume doubled. But by that time the Europeans and the gray marketers had discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>. And 1989, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ha</ENAMEX> says, has been ``very bad.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risking Spam</ENAMEX>'s high-class image and cutting into profit margins, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheil</ENAMEX> recently dropped the price of Spam to its current level from 2,650 won, or about $3.95, because of price pressure from European luncheon-meat makers, which charge about 1,000 won for a 12-ounce can. Advertising, too, has been scaled back.
Still, Spam buying has been brisk during this autumn gift-giving season, a time that in the past two years has accounted for almost half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheil</ENAMEX>'s Spam sales. And why not? Who could resist treating that favorite housewife to a gift set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spam</ENAMEX> conveniently packaged with canisters of sugar and monosodium glutamate? Or bringing a smile to an office mate's face with some Spam in a blue vinyl briefcase?
