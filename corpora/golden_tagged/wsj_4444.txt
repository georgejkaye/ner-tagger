Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gigot</ENAMEX>'s Aug. 25 Potomac Watch column on high-definition TV (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX>): Japanese chips are critical components of American weapons. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> now reports and U.S. experts confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is about five years ahead of the U.S. in semiconductor technology. In a new book, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> That Could Say'No'No,' ``two Japanese leaders speculate about the change in the world military balance if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> were to stop selling chips to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and sell them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> As invigoration of the American chip industry depends upon a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market for its chips, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> is critical to the defense of the country.
It is strange to see those who call themselves ``conservatives'' subvert their country's interests in the name of a free-market ideology that few countries practice. The denial of reality is a costly disease.

There are many views on the importance to the U.S. of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> and high-definition technology. One is that it is simply a way to get better TV pictures. The other extreme is that it represents a whole slew of related semiconductor, computer and display technologies that will be the basis of the coming information age.
The latter is certainly what the Japanese and Europeans believe. They've already sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into research and early product development. The Japanese in particular believe high-definition is the keystone to their competitiveness in the high-technology stakes.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gigot</ENAMEX> uses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gilder</ENAMEX> as an expert source on the subject. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilder</ENAMEX> belongs to a very small minority. Even those who think of high-definition only as a TV technology consider it far from dead. In quoting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilder</ENAMEX>, however, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gigot</ENAMEX> betrays his simplistic approach to the issue: He is a free-marketer, for whom the traditional American value of independence and entrepreneurism conquer all. They did in the past, but are they sufficient now and for the future? American drive captured the world's high-tech markets 30 years ago, but the rest of the world hasn't stood still. The Japanese certainly learned their lesson, and unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> learns to compete on a global basis, it will run second to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> as a technology power in the next century.

Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gigot</ENAMEX> aptly criticizes those who would lobby for an industrial policy to foster an HDTV broadcast standard. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> industrial policy inevitably would bring us second-rate technology. But it is more than bad policy. It is fruitless.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> can not be launched economically via existing commercial broadcast in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for several reasons. There is no additional spectrum available to allocate for the 50%-100%  increase in bandwidth necessary for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> as an augmented broadcast format. No legislative, regulatory or judicial relief is likely to be available for simulcasting on additional channels by current commercial broadcasters.
Even if that wholly unrealistic relief should come to pass, we face the resulting ``chicken-and-egg'' failure. In other words, there will be no consumer market to buy $50 billion of new TV sets and no commercial market to finance $25 billion in transmission for broadcasting.
We should realize that aggregates of various unfettered markets can drive a pervasive new high-resolution technology by combining the following niches -- direct broadcast satellite (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DBS</ENAMEX>) and community antenna television (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CATV</ENAMEX>); videodiscs and cassettes; a variety of compact disc video formats; microcomputers and video games, fiber-optic phones, data networks and videotex.
That realization can shape a truly creative American resolution to the challenges of our rapidly changing media environment, brought on in part by the failing struggles of our network television.
