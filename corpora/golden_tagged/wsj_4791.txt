<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> tapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Sheeran</ENAMEX>, a cost-cutting and efficiency sleuth, for a new post designed to find economies of scale in its 14 key businesses.
``We're trying to leverage some of the same concepts'' that might be applied specifically to a division and apply them to the company as a whole, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheeran</ENAMEX> said.
The engineer, who will become vice president of corporate engineering, production and sourcing on Oct. 1, will scrutinize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GE</ENAMEX>, other companies and academia to find efficiency techniques that can be implemented companywide, he said.
Formerly general manager of the technology department for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Electrical Distribution and Control</ENAMEX>, the 50-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheeran</ENAMEX> oversaw a four-year project to automate the department's lighting panelboard production.
At the department's operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plainview</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, five production facilities were folded into one and the number of parts in the panelboard was reduced to 1,275 from 28,000, while the number of product configurations was expanded to more than 40,000. Also, the order-to-ship cycle was cut to three days from three weeks.
Previously, the corporate engineering and manufacturing operation had worked efficiencies between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s business groups, but mostly on a trouble-shooting or consulting basis. That operation will be folded into Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheeran</ENAMEX>'s group, which he said will be looking for better ways to do things before problems crop up.
Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> had total costs and expenses of more than $35 billion. The company's annual goal is to improve cost productivity by 6%. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, concern has interests in many businesses including lighting, plastics, aircraft engines, industrial products, appliances, electrical controls, medical systems, factory automation and broadcasting and financial services.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheeran</ENAMEX> wouldn't discuss his strategy in the new job and said corporate headquarters didn't outline problems to be addressed. But ``the most dramatic things will be focused on the product businesses rather than services,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheeran</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sourcing</ENAMEX> -- or purchasing -- is often viewed as ``under production,'' he said, and putting it on equal ground with manufacturing and  engineering should strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s ability to streamline operations. The general managers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s sourcing, technology resources and production resources operations will report to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheeran</ENAMEX>, who in turn will report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward E. Hood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> vice chairman.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheeran</ENAMEX>, who has a doctorate in aerospace engineering and a master's degree in mechanical engineering from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syracuse University</ENAMEX>, has also worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s fluid mechanics program.
