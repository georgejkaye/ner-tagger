<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> can wipe out inflation without causing a recession, but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> said he and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> governors endorse a bill by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Neal</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>) that would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years. ``Such a deadline is attainable, but it would have costs,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> told Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX>'s monetary policy subcommittee.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chief opposed a bill-introduced by Reps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hamilton</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Dorgan</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.D.</ENAMEX>) -- that, among other things, would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
In responding to questions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> played down reports of tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> over exchange-rate policy.
``What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics,'' he said. He didn't elaborate. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> isn't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> is frustrated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar's value.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> said the inflation rate, currently about 4 1/2%, ``could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession, but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output.'' In other words, economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>, who has repeatedly said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s goal is to reduce inflation, added that ``whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter.''
He warned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce ``a major financial crunch'' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit, which causes the government to borrow heavily.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX>'s bill originally called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter. He altered the wording to win Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s endorsement. Even so, his bill is given little chance of passage.
Reps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorgan</ENAMEX> also have altered their bill, dropping a proposal to add the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary to the 12-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> committee that makes monetary policy. Instead, the bill simply calls for twice-a-year meetings between the committee and top administration officials.
Even that met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s disapproval because it might subject the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> ``to a more intensely political perspective'' and ``could risk bending monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals.''
While each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dorgan</ENAMEX> proposals represents only a small step, together they would erode the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s independence, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy, he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Reform</ENAMEX> Act of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates.
