The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX>, in its first explanation of last week's agreement to end <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International Corp.</ENAMEX>'s contract to operate the Rocky Flats nuclear-weapons plant, said the company had failed to make enough environmental, health and safety improvements.
The agency's statements make clear that its dissatisfaction with the company's job performance played a bigger role than previously acknowledged by either party.
It also indicates that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> was at least as interested in replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Segundo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, aerospace concern was in being replaced. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> several times had threatened to break its contract to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> defense plant, most recently in a dispute over waste disposal. The announcement last week said the contract was ended by mutual agreement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Kaliniak</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Watkins</ENAMEX> ``decided it was time to make a change'' after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> was given two chances this year to come up with a management plan for improving its operations at Rocky Flats, and both times the plans were found unsatisfactory.
``We were not happy with their plans to address our issues of environment, health and safety,'' she said.
After the second plan was found inadequate, she said, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watkins</ENAMEX> ``decided something needed to be changed and that basically it {the contract} needed to come to an end.''
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaliniak</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> received a ``less than satisfactory'' rating in the environmental, health and safety area in its latest six-month evaluation for the period ended March 31. As a result, it received less than 40% -- or under $3.1 million -- of potential operating fees of $7.8 million.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> assertions. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> had agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> not to discuss cancellation of the contract. ``We plan to honor that agreement,'' he said.
Over the weekend, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> said the agreement to exit Rocky Flats resulted from a dispute with the government over waste disposal.
That dispute culminated last week in a lawsuit against the government. A day later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> it wanted to break the contract. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaliniak</ENAMEX> said the department considered the lawsuit ``needless'' and said it was the ``last straw'' in its tense relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EG&G Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellesley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, scientific instrument company, has accepted the government's offer to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocky Flats</ENAMEX>. Its officials arrived at Rocky Flats yesterday afternoon to begin the transition.
