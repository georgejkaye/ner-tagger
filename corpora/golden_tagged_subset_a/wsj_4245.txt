Because of U.S. reservations about increasing the resources of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX>, both institutions ended their annual meetings uncertain about their quests for further funds.
The respective roles of the two international agencies, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-led international debt strategy, and the troubled economies of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> also provided major focuses for the meetings, which ended yesterday. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s attempts to regain access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> loans didn't make headway, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber Conable</ENAMEX> said he hoped the institution soon would be able to resume lending to that country. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> cut off lending to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> in June, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> government cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> is campaigning for a $14.5 billion increase in the resources of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Development Association</ENAMEX> unit, which lends to the world's poorest countries. Most member countries have agreed to contribute their share of the increase, but they still are waiting for agreement from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, which is stalling. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> contribution would be just over $1 billion a year for three years, or about 22% of the total.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conable</ENAMEX> said that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> doesn't agree to join in increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDA</ENAMEX>'s funds by the time of a forthcoming meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> affiliate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, in November, ``it'll be a serious blow to support for the poorest people in the world.'' ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> should consider whether it wants to reduce its influence in the poorest countries in the world,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conable</ENAMEX> said in an interview.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said Wednesday that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDA</ENAMEX> ``will continue to have the support of the U.S.'' In negotiations on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDA</ENAMEX> replenishment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials have cited difficulties in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for their slowness in agreeing on funds for the unit.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conable</ENAMEX>, a former senior congressman himself, said, ``I am really not concerned about Congress.'' There's a ``completely different'' and more favorable attitude in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to the IDA than there is toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> as a whole, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conable</ENAMEX> said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> also is looking for funds. Its managing director, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Camdessus</ENAMEX>, is seeking a 100% increase in resources -- about $120 billion -- from member countries. The Bush administration has agreed to consider an increase by the end of the year. But unlike most members, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> contends that a strong case hasn't yet been made for an increase. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, which effectively holds a veto in the fund, also wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> to clear up its arrears and define its role more sharply.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camdessus</ENAMEX> said that he believed the annual meetings ``have established an important consensus on the need to strengthen the fund's resources.'' At a news conference yesterday, he said that 70% of the voting membership ``is for an increase of 67% or more'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s resources. He obliquely referred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> -- the three countries that don't back such an increase -- when he asked, ``will the three countries veto the increase?''
Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> may face opposition in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. ``There's going to be some trouble up here on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> quota increase,'' said a staffer for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Fauntroy</ENAMEX>, chairman of a House subcommittee on international development, finance, trade and monetary policy. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> would be well advised to differentiate its role more clearly,'' he added.
Traditionally, there still is confusion over the two institutions' respective roles despite an agreement between them earlier this year. ``It's procedural,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conable</ENAMEX> said, discussing the frictions between the two agencies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> ``is getting into some of the longer-term stuff that was traditionally ours,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conable</ENAMEX> said. In the past, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> has concentrated more on making short-term loans and devising economic reform programs to help nations with balance-of-payments difficulties, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> generally has made longer-term loans to foster economic development.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conable</ENAMEX> said the recent agreement gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> primacy in matters regarding macroeconomic policy, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> ``in return,'' gets ``primacy'' in longer-term lending.
Meanwhile, the two institutions seem to have switched roles this year in their approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IMF</ENAMEX> this week agreed to a $1.4 billion loan accord with that troubled country, while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conable</ENAMEX> merely pledged to support the country's planned economic adjustment efforts. In a controversial move at last year's annual meetings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> lent to Argentina while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> issued a statement of support for the nation. At the time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> was criticized for lending before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> had.
