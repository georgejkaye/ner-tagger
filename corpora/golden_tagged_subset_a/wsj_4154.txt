Having cast his net across much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo De Benedetti</ENAMEX> is now looking east.
The Italian financier is close to announcing that he's setting up a holding company to buy controlling stakes in Hungarian companies, according to Hungarian sources. The venture could be unveiled in a few weeks, once Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Benedetti</ENAMEX> has lined up partners. Financial sources said that, to their knowledge, it would be the first venture of its type in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
The launch of the holding company by one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s most flamboyant capitalists would be the most spectacular sign yet of a growing interest by Western businesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern European</ENAMEX> country that is regarded as having moved the furthest toward a market economy.
In the past couple of years, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, seeking to attract Western capital to combat an economic crisis, has opened a stock market, passed laws to encourage corporate activity and outlined plans to sell about 50 state-run companies.
But apart from the creation of a few country investment funds such as the $1.8 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum Fund</ENAMEX> -- run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Soros</ENAMEX>, a Hungarian-born money manager in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> -- and a few foreign investments such as a recent buy-out of a small paper company organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>, there has been more talk than action.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Benedetti</ENAMEX> has long advocated a kind of ``Marshall Plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Europe.</ENAMEX>'' He is said to feel that there are fewer obstacles to doing business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> than in other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern European</ENAMEX> countries. The forint, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>'s currency, isn't convertible, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> allows Western companies to repatriate profit in foreign currency at the official rate, which is only about 10% lower than the black market rate. The venture would fit into Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Benedetti</ENAMEX>'s strategy of getting in on the ground floor in emerging markets. After becoming a significant operator on the Italian and French markets through his three major holding companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cofide</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cerus</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Benedetti</ENAMEX> has set up investment vehicles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX> and also hopes to set up shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>.
``The guy who arrives first has more room to maneuver than the others,'' said one financial source familiar with the project. ``The logic of the Hungarian operation is the same that underpinned the Spanish, Portuguese and Greek ventures: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invest</ENAMEX> in countries that will provide a good return on investment and whose companies could benefit from {Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Benedetti</ENAMEX>'s} management experience.''
As with his other holding companies, the Hungarian venture would be likely to focus on taking stakes that give it management control of companies, rather than simply making investments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cerus</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Benedetti</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-based holding company that serves as his international expansion arm, is expected to be the dominant shareholder in the new Hungarian venture. But sources say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Benedetti</ENAMEX> is seeking to line up both international and Hungarian partners.
