<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to sell its idle supercomputer manufacturing plant here to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co.</ENAMEX> for $5.8 million.
The tentative agreement calls for 3M to use the 115,000-square-foot plant and 19 acres of land for research laboratories. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> has been seeking a buyer for the facility since it folded its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ETA Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> supercomputer unit this past April.
