Like so many trends in the entertainment industry, the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high-mindedness and self-interest. The former comes from the latest wave of political activism in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, especially around feminist issues such as abortion. The latter comes from the perception, on the part of many people in network TV, that their only hope of keeping viewers from defecting to cable is to fill the airwaves with an increasingly raw sensationalism. Put these together, and you get programs about rape.
The best of the crop was last week's season premiere of ``In the Heat of the Night,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> series based on a 1967 feature film about a black <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> police detective in a small Southern town. In the series, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgil Tibbs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Rollins</ENAMEX>) and his wife, Althea (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne-Marie Johnson</ENAMEX>) have settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sparta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss.</ENAMEX> Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, this episode -- in which Althea gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher -- does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime.
Obviously, it's harder to establish a sense of place in a one-shot TV movie. But tonight's offering , ``Settle the Score'' (9-11 p.m. EST, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>), doesn't even try. This tale of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ozarks</ENAMEX>. But it's more like an illustration of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Stein</ENAMEX> describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry: ``Fear of violence and animosity... because of race or religion, fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small-town people... produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers.''
The writer and executive producer of ``Settle the Score,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Sohmer</ENAMEX>, is a graduate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> who participated in a PBS documentary, aired this summer, in which six members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation. At one point in the documentary, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX>, who is Jewish, says he felt rejected by many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Protestants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southerners</ENAMEX> he met at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>. He quotes one student saying, ``You're just the kind of Jewboy we Southerners can't stand.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX> confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now ``a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>.'' But is exile in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> enough? Not to judge by ``Settle the Score,'' in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX> seems to be settling a score of his own. Of all the unflattering portraits of small-town America I've seen on TV, this film is the most gratuitously nasty. The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate (Jaclyn Smith</ENAMEX>), and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Protestants</ENAMEX> whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex.
I mean, these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty Kate for the fact that when she was a teen-ager, someone tied her hands behind her back, thrust her head into a gunny sack, brutally raped and beat her, and then left her to die in a cold-storage room. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pa</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Duff</ENAMEX>) is the kind of guy who, while saying grace at the supper table, pauses at the word ``sin'' and glares at the daughter he hasn't seen for two decades, because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold-storage room, and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>.
People like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa</ENAMEX> do exist, of course. But in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ozarks</ENAMEX>, he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg. Every man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical, viciously patronizing, revoltingly lecherous, or all three. Add the fact that any one of them, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa</ENAMEX>, could be her attacker, and you have a setting that doesn't resemble small-town <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, or even <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s nightmare of small-town <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Atwood</ENAMEX>'s ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handmaid</ENAMEX>'s Tale,'' itself soon to be (you guessed it) a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> movie.
There are two exceptions: Josh (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Demunn</ENAMEX>), the local doctor who has always loved <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kate</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Masur</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX>'s simple-minded but affectionate brother. Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she's seething with anger and fear, but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy. How could he be? He's the director of the local Planned Parenthood chapter. As for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>, if you can't guess why he's so sweet to his sister when everybody else hates her, then I'm not going to tell you.
As for the women, they're pathetic. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kate</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma (Louise Latham</ENAMEX>) is a moral coward. Her sister-in-law (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Wright</ENAMEX>) is a sniveling prude afraid that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> will seduce all the married men in town, including a particularly loathsome fellow named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker</ENAMEX>, whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns, while he bullies <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs. At the very least, it would appear that Sis is a poor judge of masculine charm.
Yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of ``Settle the Score.'' In the aforementioned episode of ``In the Heat of the Night,'' we saw Althea being attacked, but we weren't invited to enjoy the spectacle. In Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX>'s film, by contrast, we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim, as the camera ogles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kate</ENAMEX> in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed-up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape.
At this point, the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy. Take the scene in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kate</ENAMEX> stands naked by a lighted window, whispering to her hidden assailant, ``Look all you want. Starting tomorrow, I'm stalking you.'' Or the one in which she and Josh are stranded in the city, and, after insisting on separate motel rooms, she knocks on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape -- wearing nothing but a mini-slip and a push-up bra. Surely the question is obvious. With friends like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sohmer</ENAMEX>, do the feminists of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> need enemies?
