<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Industrial Corp.</ENAMEX> likes to move fast. Last week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> trading and investment-holding company said it sold a shopping center to a unit of Japanese retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sogo Co.</ENAMEX> for 690 million <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> dollars (US$348.7 million), nearly double the price it paid just 10 months ago. The next day, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UIC</ENAMEX> said it had paid S$230.7 million for a 13% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore Land Ltd.</ENAMEX>, the country's leading property company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>'s stock market responded favorably. Shares of property companies -- especially those with holdings on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orchard Road</ENAMEX>, where the shopping center was located -- rose sharply, as did the prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UIC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore Land.</ENAMEX>
With an estimated S$1 billion in assets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UIC</ENAMEX> may be on the verge of transforming itself into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>'s leading property concerns, analysts say. First, though, they say, it must decide whether it will become a staid member of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>'s corporate community or whether it will continue as an aggressive trader. Given the company's new prominence, the swift asset-trading moves that have been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UIC</ENAMEX>'s trademark could become less welcome in in highly regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>.
A reminder of the republic's toughness came Sept. 16 when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Ng</ENAMEX>, a businessman and former executive deputy chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>'s biggest bank, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Overseas Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX>, was sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to insider-trading charges.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ng</ENAMEX> was briefly the darling of the market after he carried out three big property transactions in 1987. He was credited with reviving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>'s then-moribund property market, but he came to grief while gaining control of what ultimately became his stock-market vehicle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> In pleading guilty, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ng</ENAMEX> admitted to having <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Capital</ENAMEX> shares bought for him while in possession of price-sensitive information.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ng</ENAMEX> sold his stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Capital</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UIC</ENAMEX> in 1987. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UIC</ENAMEX> has undergone a metamorphosis since then, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lim Kok An</ENAMEX>, an analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fenner & Smith</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pte.</ENAMEX>, from a small detergent maker with scattered investments, including pig farms, to a huge concern with most of its assets in property.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lim</ENAMEX> believes the transformation will last. ``I don't think you can ignore it's now a prime property stock,'' he says, adding that the president and chief executive officer, Oei <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hong Leong</ENAMEX>, ``is looking for a long-term play.'' The company's chairman is Lee <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Yew</ENAMEX>, younger brother of Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Kuan Yew</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lim</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UIC</ENAMEX> has been attracting interest from overseas investors. Other analysts say the company's aggressive reputation makes many foreign fund managers nervous. ``The management have always been wheeler-dealers,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Woods</ENAMEX>, head of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays de Zoete Union Pacific Pte</ENAMEX>. But, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX>, ``there's no large institutional following.
