(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BERNARD CORNFELD</ENAMEX>, THE SHOWY FOUNDER of ``go-go'' offshore mutual funds, was riding high when a U.S. agency asked him for records on Nov. 29, 1965.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornfeld</ENAMEX>, a former social worker, founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investors Overseas Services</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>-based, Panama-incorporated fund manager, in 1960 to sell funds outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> He didn't comply with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>'s request, claiming it would violate Swiss privacy laws. So, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> on Feb. 7, 1966, began an inquiry, charging IOS with the illegal sale of unregistered securities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOS</ENAMEX> called the charges ``outrageous.''
By then IOS had branches in 78 countries and Fund of Funds, its largest, was a world leader. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornfeld</ENAMEX>, worth $150 million, owned a town house built by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Napoleon</ENAMEX>, an 11th century castle, horses and more.
His formula was simple: set up subsidiary fund-selling firms around the world and deploy people to sell funds that, in turn, invested in U.S. mutual funds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornfeld</ENAMEX> asked salesmen prospects: ``Do you sincerely want to be rich?'' Buyers didn't realize they, in effect, paid commissions twice: to the IOS fund and to the U.S. funds in the IOS portfolio.
Despite a May 1967 order barring IOS companies from operating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, it kept growing abroad -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornfeld</ENAMEX> had his own jet. By the end of 1969 IOS had a million customers in 100 countries and $2.5 billion of managed assets. In 1970, as the U.S. stock market plunged, IOS stock sank to $2 from the $20s in late 1969. Law cases sprang from the debris.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOS</ENAMEX> directors forced chairman Cornfeld out on May 8, 1970; in 1973 the Swiss jailed him for nearly a year on fraud charges, but ajury acquitted him in 1979. Currently, he's living a cheerful life as a European real estate developer. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Vesco</ENAMEX>, who had become IOS chairman in 1971, fled the U.S. in early 1973 after being charged with looting $224 million in IOS funds and with making illegal political contributions.
