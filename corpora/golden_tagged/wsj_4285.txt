<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hertz Corp.</ENAMEX>, in a bid to entice more leisure rental-car customers, tapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells, Rich, Greene</ENAMEX> as its ad agency to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccabe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sloves</ENAMEX> on its $25 million to $30 million account.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scali Mccabe</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX>, had handled the account for 10 years. Its ouster almost certainly spells the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hertz</ENAMEX>'s latest long-running campaign featuring actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Lee Curtis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jocks O.J. Simpson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Palmer</ENAMEX>. That campaign was geared largely toward the business customer -- but that segment of the business is growing at less than half the rate of vacation rentals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hertz</ENAMEX> invited five agencies to vie for the account in a creative shoot-out, with each coming up with speculative campaigns. The agencies' mission, according to executives involved, was to reposition the car rental company for the 1990s -- to appeal to vacationers in the same way Hertz already appeals to business travelers. Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scali</ENAMEX>, the other agencies involved were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> and privately held agencies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N W Ayer</ENAMEX>, all based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX>, the win is a much-needed boost. Earlier this year, it lost the $20 million-to-$25 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadbury Schweppes Canada</ENAMEX> Dry and Sunkist account. Just in the past few weeks, it lost the $15 million Sure account from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>, as well as the $10 million Polo/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX> business. But the agency, which handled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> business until last year, has done well in the travel area, picking up more than $30 million in billings from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton Corp.</ENAMEX> earlier this year. Last week, it won a $5 million to $10 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dun & Bradstreet</ENAMEX> account.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Olshan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX>'s chairman, said agency staffers toasted the win yesterday with champagne in the company's midtown headquarters. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> will begin working on the account immediately, and ads would probably break early next year. He declined to describe the creative work used in the agency's pitch.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scali</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Sloves</ENAMEX> said, ``We'll go on, and there are other rental car companies. We're ready and we're waiting.'' He added, ``I'm tough enough and mean enough to want to get even, but I'm also gracious enough to know that you win some and lose some.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scali</ENAMEX> had had an otherwise good year until now, winning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trump Shuttle</ENAMEX>, among other accounts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hertz</ENAMEX>, the nation's largest car-rental company, in recent years has been squeezed by smaller competitors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alamo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thrifty</ENAMEX> that have aggressively wooed vacationers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Finnie</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alex.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown & Sons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, notes that over the past five years, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alamo</ENAMEX> has grown at more than a 25% a year pace by courting leisure travelers. ``That's a business that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hertz</ENAMEX> doesn't want to give up without a fight,'' he says. During the same period, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hertz</ENAMEX> grew 5% to 10% a year, though from a much larger base.
Vacation rentals have been booming since the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978, when airfare prices plummetted and more people began flying to vacation spots. At the same time, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finnie</ENAMEX> notes, two-income families ``have changed the way they vacation. Instead of piling into the car and going away for two weeks, they take short vacations'' -- and in vacationing more frequently, they rent cars more often.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hertz</ENAMEX> has run ads geared to leisure travelers before, primarily by dressing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simpson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmer</ENAMEX> in tacky tourist clothes and having them croon ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, Here We Come'' and ``Moon Over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>'' while at the wheel of a rented car. But those ads apparently didn't have the intended result. Whether the car rental giant now can shake its image as an expensive firm more suitable for expense-account travel than for vacationing remains to be seen.
Ad Notes....
ACQUISITION: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based Lowe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker Metcalf</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lowe International</ENAMEX>, acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homer & Durham</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> agency. The combined agency, which will be called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowe Tucker Metcalf</ENAMEX>, will have billings of $55 million. Terms weren't disclosed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNITED AIRLINES</ENAMEX>: In a new TV spot, the airline unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> pitches the power of business travel to companies that have cut travel expenses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leo Burnett Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, developed the ad, which shows a chief executive-type telling his troops that a major client is taking its business elsewhere, possibly because one-on-one business communication had been replaced by fax transmissions and phone calls.
NEW ACCOUNT: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Andover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, awarded its $3 million medical products group account to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leonard Monahan Lubars & Partners</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Providence</ENAMEX>, R.I. The account had been handled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardini/Russell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Watertown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass</ENAMEX>.... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, picked up two accounts, Fisher <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountainbikes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Rafael</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyatt Hotels</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
