Former Democratic fund-raiser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas M. Gaubert</ENAMEX>, whose savings and loan was wrested from his control by federal thrift regulators, has been granted court permission to sue the regulators.
In a ruling by the Fifth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Orleans</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaubert</ENAMEX> received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Bank Board</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> for losses he suffered when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank Board</ENAMEX> closed the Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Savings Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irving</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaubert</ENAMEX>, who was chairman and the majority stockholder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent American</ENAMEX>, had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan. As part of the agreement, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaubert</ENAMEX> contributed real estate valued at $25 million to the assets of Independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American.</ENAMEX>
While under the control of federal regulators, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent American</ENAMEX>'s net worth dropped from $75 million to a negative $400 million, wiping out the value of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaubert</ENAMEX>'s real estate contribution and his stock in the institution.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaubert</ENAMEX>'s suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maloney</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Tort Claims Act</ENAMEX>, which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees.
Earlier this week, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fifth Circuit</ENAMEX> appellate panel upheld Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maloney</ENAMEX>'s dismissal of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaubert</ENAMEX>'s claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaubert</ENAMEX>'s claim for the loss of his property. ``It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise... that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent American</ENAMEX>, the court wrote. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaubert</ENAMEX>'s lawyer, Abbe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Lowell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts. ``I don't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowell</ENAMEX> says. ``It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAITRE</ENAMEX>'D CLAIMS in suit that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant.
In a suit filed in state court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX> is representing the former maitre'd of the chic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Odeon</ENAMEX> restaurant. The suit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $1 million, alleges that the firing of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcia Trees Levine</ENAMEX> violated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York state</ENAMEX>'s human-rights law. Among other things, the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy.
The suit alleges that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> was fired after she refused to accept a lower paying, less visible job upon reaching her sixth month of pregnancy. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> told her employer that she was pregnant in February; a month later, the suit says, the restaurant manager told Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> that she would be demoted to his assistant because he felt customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre'd.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kary Moss</ENAMEX>, an attorney with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACLU</ENAMEX>'s Women's Rights Project, said, ``They wanted a svelte-looking woman, and a pregnant woman is not svelte. They told her,'We'We don't hire fat people and we don't hire cripples. And pregnant women are fat.''' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moss</ENAMEX> said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon</ENAMEX> in which they told her she was being fired as maitre'd because she was pregnant.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul H. Aloe</ENAMEX>, an attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon</ENAMEX> owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Mcnally</ENAMEX>, denied the allegations. He said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> had never been fired, although she had stopped working at the restaurant. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon</ENAMEX> made a written offer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcia Levine</ENAMEX> on July 10 to return to work as the maitre'd, at the same pay, same hours and with back pay accrued,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aloe</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon ``</ENAMEX>has no policy against hiring pregnant people.''
LAWYERS IN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>'s biggest bank-fraud case want out in face of retrial.
Lawyers representing five of the seven defendants in the case say their clients can no longer afford their services. The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury.
The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than $130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30, east of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>.
The defense lawyers, three of whom are solo practitioners, say they can't afford to put their law practices on hold for another seven-month trial. Some of the lawyers say they would continue to represent their clients if the government pays their tab as court-appointed lawyers.
Assistant U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Hart</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> says the government will oppose any efforts to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEDERAL JUDGE ALCEE HASTINGS</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, facing impeachment, received an unanticipated boost yesterday. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlen Specter</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>) urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> colleagues during closed-door deliberations. Among other things, the brief cited insufficient evidence. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specter</ENAMEX> was vice chairman of the impeachment trial committee that heard evidence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hastings</ENAMEX> case last summer. A former prosecutor and member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX>, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specter</ENAMEX> is expected to exercise influence when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> votes on the impeachment today.
