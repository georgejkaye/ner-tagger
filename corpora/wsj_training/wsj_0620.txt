<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> is resigning from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Wildlife Federation</ENAMEX>'s corporate advisory panel, saying the conservation group has been unfairly critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> Valdez oil spill along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaskan coast</ENAMEX>.
The federation said Friday that it regrets the resignation, but issued a stinging response that called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> a ``corporate pariah'' that should keep an open dialogue with environmentalists.
The federation, with 5.8 million members nationwide, has been one of the sharpest critics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>'s handling of the 11 million gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of repeatedly ignoring requests to meet and discuss it.
The March 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline along <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>'s southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and the fishing industry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon USA</ENAMEX> unit was one of the charter members of the Corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservation Council</ENAMEX>, a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Wildlife Federation</ENAMEX> to foster ``frank and open discussions'' between industry and the federation's leaders.
In a letter to the federation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Campion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>'s environmental coordinator, said: ``Recent public actions by you regarding the Valdez oil spill have failed to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness.''
The federation was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in August against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> seeking full payment of environmental recovery costs from the spill.
