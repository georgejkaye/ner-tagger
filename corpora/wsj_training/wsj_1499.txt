, under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX>'s formulation that ``if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> is quite clear: No new ducks.
But what about all those non-duck ducks flapping over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>? We see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the American economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities. Federal child care (quack). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean Air</ENAMEX> bill (quack). The disabled-workers bill (quack, quack).
The Bush <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> did: It hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air, better treatment of the disabled, better child care. It comes up with a toned-down version of a Democratic proposal. The bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly, wondering where all the ``unexpected'' costs came from.
Consider, for instance, the very fat fowl known as federalized child care. The President came up with a good bill, but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>. It would create 38,000 local day-care commissions, answerable to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Services</ENAMEX>. They'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day, and they'd regulate the storage facilities. The initial costs are said to be in the $2 billion a year range, but that's only the beginning. New entitlements tend to grow, creating a rationale for new taxes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quack</ENAMEX>.
The administration claims that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean Air</ENAMEX> bill will cost businesses between $14 billion and $19 billion annually, but economist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Evans</ENAMEX> estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $60 billion a year range.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways. For example, the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants. So instead of building more efficient modern plants, utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants. The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new, cleaner technology.
The bill also imposes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide, as if a car registered in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Sky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX>, needed to be as clean as one driven in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. Proponents of the nationwide standards say the cost for car buyers would be about $500 per car. Other analysts say that estimate is low. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quack</ENAMEX>.
Nobody knows how many billions of dollars the Americans With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disabilities</ENAMEX> Act will cost, because nobody knows what the bill entails. It is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation. Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts. Lawyers will benefit. Private companies, and ultimately their customers, will end up footing the huge bill.
The effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX> era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions. All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists, some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people, states and local governments.
Running for President in 1980 and 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s. In fact, during last year's campaign, the entire nation constantly heard Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> tout his accomplishments as head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Task Force on Regulatory Relief.</ENAMEX>
``Government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of American business,'' the vice president declared when he was head of the task force.
But with the impending passage of these new programs, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will surely be sending many people hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back. By 1986, the number of federal regulators was down to about 103,000. Then it turned up, and by one estimate the number will be up to about 109,000 regulators by next year.
Holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> presidency. We would have thought by now, though, that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation isn't the only way to slow down an economy. It is merely the most obvious. What is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire. But while they are unloading these burdens, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> is close to creating three more big ones.
The Bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks.
