<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Neuharth</ENAMEX> has written a book. His picture is on the cover. His picture is on the back. His picture is on the front, the part that shows when it's on the bookshelf. The book, an autobiography, surely sets a record for use of the word I.
The book is full of lists (``World's  most overrated hotels;'' ``Top Ten Heads of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State.</ENAMEX>'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Really.</ENAMEX>) and bumper-sticker philosophy (``Keep bean counters on tap, never on top''). In the book, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> gossips, feuds, carps, boasts and preaches.
Often, the book is insufferable. But, then, often <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Neuharth</ENAMEX> is insufferable.
But he's brilliant. He took -- grabbed by the throat, really -- a little company with a handful of mediocre newspapers and turned it into a communications behemoth. And then when it was huge -- of a size at which most companies are lumbering or slumbering -- he brought to it a small-company, entrepreneurial attitude.
That's how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett Co.</ENAMEX> grew. That's how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> TODAY was born.
There's a lesson there, for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s business and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s businessmen.
You don't have to be outlandish or outrageous or outspoken -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> is all three -- to be competitive and innovative. But you do have to have vision and take risks. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> had that vision and took those risks. (That's past tense. At 65, he has retired as chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett.</ENAMEX>)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett</ENAMEX> could have remained a lively little company that eventually would be eaten up by a bigger media company. Or it could have grown and becomed sluggish and sassy like so many big corporations. Instead, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> turned to what he calls ``intrapreneurship'' to stimulate his employees, serve his customers and enrich his stockholders.
``Intrapreneurship'' is the use of internal talent, internal equipment and internal money to create a new product. ``Most large companies have a huge and generally untapped pool of underutilized talent and equipment that can give them a great financial advantage over others in undertaking major projects or new ventures,'' he writes.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> freed the people, the equipment and the money -- and kept the bureaucrats at bay -- to develop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> TODAY, an idea and then a product that was scoffed at by everyone but the public.
Can you think of another huge company that has taken such a huge risk and developed a totally new product for a totally new market? More interesting question: Can you think of another huge company that would even try?
Most successful innovations -- Reeboks or Apples -- are products of the big minds of little companies. There is more enterprise in machine shops than in research labs. Most big companies reward caution and penalize risk.
Part of the problem, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Neuharth</ENAMEX> suggests, is that the money men have too big a say in too many companies. ``They're intelligent. Well-educated. Well-intentioned. Office walls displaying MBA degrees,'' he writes. ``All of them know how to count money. A few of them know how to manage it. Very few know how to earn it. None of them is willing to risk it.''
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett</ENAMEX>'s were no different. ``Conservative, up-tight S.o.b.s. Narrow-gauged and no vision beyond the next quarterly earnings report.... During most of 1980, while the... task force was trying to figure out how to launch a national newspaper, I spent much of my time keeping a tight rein on the bean counters who were trying to bomb it.''
As a young man, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> tried to interest the men who owned the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> Herald in starting up a newspaper along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Coast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>. The idea was rejected without a hearing. ``That was my introduction to the reality that most money men and big corporations aren't interested in new ideas,'' he says. ``The comfortable status quo drives most corporations.''
Indeed. It drives some into the hands of the raiders and junk-bond purveyors and leveraged-takeover throngs. It drives others into unfavorable mergers. It drives still others into bankruptcy court.
And ``it drives me crazy,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX>.
That's the saving grace of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Neuharth</ENAMEX>. He's bizarre, which you'll see when you read his book and discover uncensored chapters by his two ex-wives. (``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Neuharth</ENAMEX> is a snake,'' writes ex-wife No. 2. ``He's cold-blooded. He's sneaky and slithers around and sheds his old skin as he grows and adapts to his newest surroundings.'') He's shifty. (``When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> wears a sharkskin suit, you can't tell where the suit ends and Al begins'' -- a quote Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> cites.)
But he's also innovative and honest. He owns up to his mistakes and learns from them. Then moves on to take new chances. A legion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neuharths</ENAMEX> might be too much for any nation to endure. But big business could use a few more of his type.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOOTNOTE</ENAMEX>. The book in question is called ``Confessions of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.O.B.</ENAMEX>'' It's published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doubleday</ENAMEX>, has 372 pages of staccato prose, and sells for $18.95 at those places that still get full price for books.
And I probably should disclose these facts: I worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett</ENAMEX> and for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> for 2 1/2 years. I was the editor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Des Moines</ENAMEX> Register before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett</ENAMEX> bought it and of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Courier-Journal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett</ENAMEX> bought it. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neuharth</ENAMEX> cites both newspapers in his book, calling them two of the most overrated newspapers in the nation. For the record, he's full of it on both counts.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gartner</ENAMEX> is editor and co-owner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daily Tribune</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ames</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>, and president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
