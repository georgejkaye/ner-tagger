<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mckinsey & Co.</ENAMEX> is close to an agreement to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Consulting Group</ENAMEX>, an affiliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX> that handles computer systems integration, industry executives said.
They said final terms haven't been set, but a letter of intent could be signed as early as next week. Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mckinsey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICG</ENAMEX> declined to comment.
The move would mark an aggressive expansion by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mckinsey</ENAMEX>, which has done well in strategic consulting with clients' senior executives on how they should use computer systems but hasn't had the nuts-and-bolts expertise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICG</ENAMEX> sells. The move would also mark the beginning of the unwinding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s consulting operations, which are expected to be sold off piecemeal in coming weeks and months.
In addition, this would mark a scaling back of some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICG</ENAMEX>'s ambitions. Founded by a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Andersen & Co.</ENAMEX> partner, with backing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICG</ENAMEX> had intended to build big computer systems for customers and take on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Andersen</ENAMEX> and the other giants of the systems-integration business. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mckinsey</ENAMEX>, which is talking internally about ``taking on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICG</ENAMEX>'s staff,'' rather than buying the business, would have ICG's 17 partners and 200 professionals focus on strategic issues rather than on implementation.
``This is an extraordinary and daring move by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mckinsey</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Whittaker</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management Consultant International</ENAMEX>, a newsletter.
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mckinsey</ENAMEX> was the world's third largest consulting firm last year, with more than $600 million in revenue and 1,800 people on its staff. But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mckinsey</ENAMEX> needed to do something because its position was being eroded by firms with the technical skills it lacked and by some of the big accounting firms, which could offer both strategic advice and technical expertise.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>, which backed ICG financially in return for an option to buy it, decided to back away from that option and to sell most or all of its consulting business so it could focus on its advertising operations after a major earnings disappointment this year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> reportedly is close to selling some of the other operations, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hay Group</ENAMEX>, which does personnel consulting, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gartner Group</ENAMEX>, which does computer consulting and market research. Some securities analysts, however, have said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> may end up presiding over a fire sale and may not get the # 250 million to # 350 million ($402.6 million to $563.7 million) it said it expected.
The decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICG</ENAMEX> stranded. It had expanded rapidly in its year of existence -- so rapidly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Andersen</ENAMEX> sued it, alleging that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICG</ENAMEX> was raiding its staff. But building computer systems requires huge amounts of capital to finance the acquisition of the hardware and the building of the software, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICG</ENAMEX> had little choice but to find another corporate home.
