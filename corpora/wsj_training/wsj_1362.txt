<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detrex Corp.</ENAMEX> said a reserve it is establishing to cover expected pollution cleanup costs at an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> plant reduced its third-quarter net income by $1.9 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detrex</ENAMEX>, which has annual sales of about $100 million, declined to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>-based company earned $774,000 in the quarter last year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detrex</ENAMEX> is setting aside $3.1 million for the cleanup, but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $1.9 million because of tax considerations.
In addition, the manufacturer said it signed a consent decree with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> to build a $1.4 million pollution-control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1, 1990.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detrex</ENAMEX> said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the Fields <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brook</ENAMEX> watershed near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detrex</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashtabula</ENAMEX> plant at a total cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> estimates at $48 million -- a figure Detrex said the companies dispute.
