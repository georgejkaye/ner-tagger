Brooks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armored Car Service Inc.</ENAMEX> never wanted to get into money laundering.
But July 5, a thunderstorm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del.</ENAMEX>, caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shellpot Creek</ENAMEX> to rise 15 feet, pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults. The water destroyed about $75 million in currency and caked $4 million of coins with mud, rendering them dangerous to counting machines.
The $75 million in paper money, although moldy, mildewy and smelly, was exchanged through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> without incident. But Brooks was unable to reach a coin-cleaning agreement with the government.
``We kind of got caught between bureaucracies,'' says President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Brooks Jr</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Mint wouldn't take the coin because it wasn't mutilated, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> accepts only clean coins, he says.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> Fed says it is merely an ``agent'' for coins, responsible only for storage and distribution. ``We issue paper money; we destroy paper money,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Hinkle</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> Fed spokeswoman. ``The coin is their problem.''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mint</ENAMEX> official says the agency offered to clean the coins for its ``bare-bones'' cost of $17,000 plus certain other expenses. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooks</ENAMEX> declined, figuring that transporting the mucked up money to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> would cost the company thousands more.
So Brooks gave the dirty work to Coin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wrap Inc.</ENAMEX>, which came up with an unusual solution.
For eight hours a day for the past two weeks, in aggregates of as much as 27,000 pounds (equaling $20,000 in pennies), Coin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wrap</ENAMEX> has been pouring money into a cement-mixing truck. A giant heater, working like a blowtorch, causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers. After clanging around for an hour or so, the shiny, hot money pours out of the cement chute, where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers. After cooling, the coins are then rewrapped.
Brooks expects to pay Coin Wrap a total of about $20,000 -- a cost that insurance won't cover. And while the job is half done, Brooks is still bitter. In fact, there's only one person involved who's happy, and that's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Floyd String</ENAMEX>, president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution. Not only did his company find $20,000 worth of work, but when the approach was suggested, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">String</ENAMEX> says, Brooks officials ``didn't laugh at me or anything.
