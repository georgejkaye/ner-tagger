<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par Pharmaceutical Inc.</ENAMEX> said it named its interim president and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth I. Sawyer</ENAMEX>, to those posts permanently, and elected him to the board.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> also said it was advised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney for Maryland that it is one of a number of companies being investigated by a federal grand jury for alleged violations of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food, Drug and Cosmetic</ENAMEX> Act. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX>, a generic-drug maker that has been plagued by management problems, was already the subject of a federal criminal inquiry into the drug-approval process and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> investigation.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> spokesman said he understood the criminal investigation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> relates to matters Par disclosed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> said it filed false drug information with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>. At the time, the company said it was recalling one of its drugs and had stopped selling two others. The spokesman said he also understood that the inquiry related to the existence of an ``off-the-record'' production book. The book noted changes made at the manufacturing level that weren't disclosed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> said it is cooperating in the investigation.
Also yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashok Patel</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> official who pleaded guilty to providing an FDA employee an illegal gratuity of $3,000, was sentenced by a federal judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> to one year of community service and a $150,000 fine. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patel</ENAMEX> also was placed on three years' probation. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patel</ENAMEX> resigned as senior vice president of Par in April. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Par</ENAMEX> and a 60%-owned unit agreed to plead guilty in that inquiry, as did another former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> official.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> began running the company on an interim basis in late September. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> said it selected him for the posts of president and chief executive on a permanent basis because of his experience in the industry and his performance at Par. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry Levine</ENAMEX>, chairman, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> had ``taken significant steps'' to restore the company's credibility and sense of professionalism and integrity.
