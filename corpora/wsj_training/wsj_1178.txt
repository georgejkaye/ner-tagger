<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Bebear</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi Assurances</ENAMEX>, pledged to retain employees and management of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo E. Denlea Jr.</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> succeeds in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> added that the French insurer would keep Farmers' headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and ``will not send French people to run the company.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> would also maintain Farmers' relationships with the insurance exchanges that it manages.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here yesterday as part of a tour in which he is trying to rally support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for the proposed acquisition. The bid is part of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s unfriendly takeover attempt for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial-services giant that acquired Farmers last year for $5.2 billion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> has agreed to acquire Farmers from Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s investment vehicle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX>, for $4.5 billion plus a $1 billion investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>.
Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers operates, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX>'s trip will take him to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> after his stay here; he will meet with insurance regulators, legislators, industry excutives and the press.
Hearings on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX>'s acquisition application have been set for Nov. 13 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX>; Nov. 20 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>; Dec. 11 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> state; and Jan. 8 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>. Hearings haven't yet been set in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s insurance commissioner doesn't hold hearings on acquisition applications.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> has been rebuffed by Farmers and hasn't had any meetings with management, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Axa</ENAMEX>. He said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denlea</ENAMEX> would be a member of the top management team of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi</ENAMEX> group of companies, and would ``help define policies and strategies of the group.''
Farmers was quick yesterday to point out the many negative aspects it sees in having Axa as its parent. For one, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa</ENAMEX> plans to do away with certain tax credits that have resulted in more than $600 million paid to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years to offset underwriting losses.
Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers, as the management company, has paid, and have ``proved to be very important for the exchanges,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers</ENAMEX> spokesman said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> contended that the tax cost to the exchanges under the revised structure would be about $8 million a year, which he described as ``peanuts.
