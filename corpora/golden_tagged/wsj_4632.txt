The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron U.S.A.</ENAMEX> of more than 100 safety violations at the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, refinery after an April fire that severely burned three employees. The agency proposed fining Chevron $877,000.
The department's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ENAMEX> alleged that Chevron knew, or should have known, about hazardous conditions at the refinery and that the company didn't make a reasonable effort to correct the situation.
Most of the alleged violations consisted of failure to provide protective equipment and clothing to 109 employees who were expected to assist fire-fighting efforts.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron U.S.A.</ENAMEX>, which is the domestic unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX>, said it will ``vigorously contest'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>'s allegations and proposed penalties. In particular, the oil company disputed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>'s findings that it failed to provide appropriate protective clothing for employees involved in the accident.
The fire started when a pipe carrying highly pressurized hydrogen gas separated at the weld, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX>. The resulting explosion and fire weakened a reactor, which breaks down crude oil into usable fuel. The reactor fell and engulfed four workers in flames.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> said three of the workers weren't wearing fire-resistant clothing and suffered second and third degree burns over 70% of their bodies. The fourth, a fire brigade member who was wearing protective clothing, escaped with only minor burns on his face.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron</ENAMEX> has until Oct. 17 to contest the proposed penalties with the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission</ENAMEX>.
