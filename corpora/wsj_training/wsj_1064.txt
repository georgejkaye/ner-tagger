<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> unveiled new optical transmission systems for data, video and voice communications.
Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said, and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991. The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $1 billion a year in sales by 1995, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan Buchner Jr.</ENAMEX>, vice president of transmission systems for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T.</ENAMEX>
The products already available are cross-connect systems, used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment. This cuts down greatly on labor, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchner</ENAMEX> said. To be introduced later are a multiplexer, which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line; a light-wave system, which carries voice channels; and a network controller, which directs data flow through cross-connect systems.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said the products, unlike previous generations, will meet so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonet</ENAMEX> compatability standards, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> expects to be broadly adopted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sonet</ENAMEX>, or synchronous optical network, products have more capacity than earlier models.
``These products are the heart of our transmission-product line,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchner</ENAMEX> said. He declined to disclose specific prices, but said each product costs in the tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of dollars.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Telecom Ltd.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcatel N.V.</ENAMEX>, which also have announced <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sonet</ENAMEX>-based products.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> predicted strong growth in demand for such products. It noted that last July, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> to supply $154 million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year.
