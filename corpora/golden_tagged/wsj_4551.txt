(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LOUIS ELWOOD WOLFSON</ENAMEX>, an early corporate raider, had his ups and downs Nov. 28, 1967, was a real downer.
On that day he was sentenced to a year in prison and fined $100,000 for selling unregistered stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Enterprises</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> real estate company he controlled. And on Dec. 8, 1968, he was hit by an added 18 months of prison plus a $32,000 fine on conviction of conspiring to obstruct a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> inquiry into the 1962-1964 stock buy-backs at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merritt-Chapman & Scott</ENAMEX>, which he was liquidating.
He took over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merritt</ENAMEX> in 1951 and built it into an early conglomerate of financing to shipbuilding concerns before it ran into debt problems.
At the first sentencing he said, ``I certainly didn't intend to do anything wrong.'' At the second, he blamed his advisors, claimed he was a victim of government ``bias'' and denied he had willfully broken the law.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfson</ENAMEX> had an earlier brush with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, which was signaling a new get-tough stance, on Aug. 1, 1958, when he consented, without admitting wrongdoing, to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> injunction against his making ``false or misleading'' statements that he still held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Motors</ENAMEX> stock when he had sold it.
His first rise to prominence was a heated 1955 unsuccessful proxy fight that sought control of Montgomery <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> from 81-year old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sewell Avery</ENAMEX>, who had headed the big retailer since 1931. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avery</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfson</ENAMEX> had a ``very hungry eye'' for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX>'s cash, and retired shortly after his victory.
Early this year the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> refused to hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfson</ENAMEX>'s second appeal to clear his name. In 1969, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abe Fortas</ENAMEX> resigned after disclosure that he had accepted $20,000 from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfson</ENAMEX> family foundation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfson</ENAMEX>'s major ups have come from horse racing. His Affirmed won the Triple Crown in 1978.
