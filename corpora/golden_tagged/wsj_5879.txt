The tax bill approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> last week, which would end tax benefits for certain securities, didn't include special treatment for a pending $3.35 billion tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical International Inc.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX>, an investment group that includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX>, had hoped that its $28-a-share offer for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>-based hospital chain would be exempted from the proposed new rules.
``The clarification <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> sought was not forthcoming. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> will now seek clarification from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>,'' said an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> spokeswoman.
The committee's refusal to grandfather the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> offer, on top of the recent price drop in the high-yield securities market, has fueled doubts that the transaction can be financed on its original terms, analysts said. ``The offer was generous in the first place, and it's looking richer all the time,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hindelong</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.</ENAMEX>
That view was reflected in the stock market Friday, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> slid $1.25 to $22.125 on turnover of about 1.5 million shares in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. The shares have slipped more than $4 since the acquisition agreement was reached in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, and the offer has been extended three times. It is now set to expire on Sept.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, which has agreed to invest $100 million of its own funds, and is arranging $713 million in subordinated debt financing for the deal, has already been hurt by weakened conditions in the junk-bond market, analysts said.
The investment banking concern had to withdraw a bond offering for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Mattress Co.</ENAMEX> last month because of lack of investor interest. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> is believed to hold a large stake in the depressed bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>, the cash-starved retailing giant.
While analysts say that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> has too much prestige riding on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> purchase to abandon it, they worry that the price will have to be lowered. ``The question I'm hearing, that I don't have an answer for, is whether that would mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> would have to reopen the bidding,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margo L. Vignola</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> offer topped proposals made by several rival bidders for the hospital company, including a group formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Lee Pearce</ENAMEX>. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pearce</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> physician, sold his 10% stake -- or about seven million shares -- for a net price of $26.375 each shortly after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA</ENAMEX> agreement was announced.
