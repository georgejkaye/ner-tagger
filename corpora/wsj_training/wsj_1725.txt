Gold and silver broker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston Semel</ENAMEX> asked a federal court to halt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> from imposing a record $550,000 fine on his firm.
The suit, filed in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, also asks that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comex</ENAMEX>'s nine-month suspension of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> be lifted, pending the broker's appeal of the disciplinary measures. The fine and suspension, announced in August, are the stiffest sanctions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comex</ENAMEX> has ever ordered against one of its members.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comex</ENAMEX> accused the 39-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> of ``fraudulent conduct'' and improper trading. The disciplinary proceedings stem from trading in April 1987.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> and his firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Semel & Co.</ENAMEX>, have appealed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comex</ENAMEX> decision and the sanctions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX>. The commission denied Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX>'s request that the fine and suspension be delayed pending the appeal.
The lawsuit states that unless the sanctions are halted pending an appeal, the broker and his firm ``will be irreparably injured and their business will be totally and permanently destroyed.'' Already the firm has paid $211,666 of the fine, the suit said, and it will have to liquidate additional assets in order to pay the rest.
A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comex</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached to comment.
