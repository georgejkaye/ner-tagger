The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has changed one of the basic tenets of its negotiating position in the strategic arms reduction talks as a way to ``get the ball rolling'' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, according to Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX>.
In a news briefing yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said he looked forward to movement in the Soviet position on START at his meeting this weekend with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>'s foreign minister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jackson Hole</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyo</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>, he said, is expected to bring a letter from Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> with new arms-control proposals.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> explained that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has instructed its negotiators to stop insisting on a ban on mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, a bargaining position it has held since the early days of the Reagan administration.
Many analysts believe the U.S. change had become inevitable. Since the early 1980s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has produced two types of mobile missiles -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SS</ENAMEX>-25 and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SS</ENAMEX>-24 -- while their U.S. counterparts -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peacekeeper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midgetman</ENAMEX> missiles -- are still in development.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Gore</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>), one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s leading experts on START, called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s move ``a valuable step,'' one that ``has long been expected because the earlier proposal for a ban was always considered irrational, even within the administration.''
To prod <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to hasten the development, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said the change was contingent upon continued funding for the two missile programs. At the moment, negotiators for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> are at loggerheads over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>'s authorization bill -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> version of which kills funds for the single-warhead <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midgetman</ENAMEX> and severely cuts money for the mobile version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peacekeeper</ENAMEX>, which carries 10 warheads.
The change, according to Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, will require negotiators to work out limits and complex verification measures for the mobile missiles, which are designed to move around in remote areas during a crisis, making them difficult to target.
``This gets us off of an unbelievable position in negotiations,'' explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Krepon</ENAMEX>, a strategic weapons analyst for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry L. Stimson Center</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> research firm. ``But we've got a ways to go here, to put it mildly.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krepon</ENAMEX> said he hopes the U.S. will include the Soviet mobile weapons in verification experiments it has suggested to test ways certain types of weapons can be accounted for. One way experts have considered is to require the mobile Icbms be marked with identifying tags as they move through certain defined geographic ``gateways'' into areas of deployment.
In his briefing, Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> also noted ``the severe challenges and pressures which the Soviets face.'' He said the goal of U.S. policy should be to ``find points of mutual advantage, gains that help them, but that also, at the same time, serve our interests.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said that progress in resolving regional conflicts, reaching arms-control agreements and Western aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> would make a ``constructive contribution to perestroika,'' or Soviet economic restructuring.
Reacting to criticism from Democrats that the administration has been too timid in its reaction to the changes under way in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said: ``When the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> is rocking along with a 70% approval rating on his handling of foreign policy, and I were the leader of the opposition party, I might have something similar to say.''
