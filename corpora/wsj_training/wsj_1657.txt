When President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy, will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> fiasco? Undoubtedly Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention, while they privately encourage more assertive U.S. action to remove Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> and safeguard their countries from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> onslaught.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg. It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Congress</ENAMEX> and avoid, at all costs, being accused of meddling in the region. The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership, which leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central America</ENAMEX> open to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet adventurism</ENAMEX>. ``The {influence of the} U.S. is not being felt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s decisions do not respond to a policy, and are divorced from reality,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Volio</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> congressman and former foreign minister.
The disarray of the Bush administration's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization of American States</ENAMEX> to condemn categorically <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Noriega</ENAMEX>. Faced with this embarrassment, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> diplomats expressed confidence that the influential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South American</ENAMEX> nations, which gathered last week in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX>, would take a stronger posture toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator. But other than a few slaps on the wrist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Noriega</ENAMEX> went unpunished by that body, too; he was not even singled out in the closing statement.
Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will come to Costa Rica and encounter Nicaraguan strongman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX>, eager for photo opportunities with the U.S. president. The host, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Arias</ENAMEX>, did not invite <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Haiti</ENAMEX> to the summit, which was to be restricted to democracies. However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> was included. Formally upgrading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> press. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Manuel Castillo</ENAMEX> -- the presidential candidate for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Liberation Party</ENAMEX> -- made public his opposition to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> ``in a democratic festivity.''
Nevertheless, the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tela</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honduras</ENAMEX>, to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> rebels. According to officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> hoped that by pleasing President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX>, it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> until after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s promises of democratic elections were tested next February. However, relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> was risky business. And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> made (at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators) to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX>'s agenda.
Prior to this episode, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Dodd</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>), sensing an open field, undertook a personal diplomatic mission through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central America</ENAMEX> to promote an early disbanding of the rebels. Visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>, he praised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honduras</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> are a hot political issue, he promised to help unblock some $70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodd</ENAMEX> had with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salvadoran</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfredo Cristiani</ENAMEX>; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cristiani</ENAMEX>'s government is very much at the mercy of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodd</ENAMEX>'s likes and dislikes. It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, virtually neglected by the Bush administration, ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December, long before the elections. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fittingly</ENAMEX>, the Tela Accords were nicknamed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hondurans</ENAMEX> ``the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodd</ENAMEX> plan.''
The individual foreign policy carried out by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>. On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX>, Soviet Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Managua</ENAMEX> to acclaim ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>'s great peace efforts.'' There, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan: The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.S.R.</ENAMEX> would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>. He also called on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>'s neighbors to accept a ``military equilibrium'' guaranteed by both superpowers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> claims that in spite of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s words, East bloc weapons continue to flow into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> at near-record levels.
Since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>'s proposals followed discussions with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, speculations arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>. This scheme would fit the Arias Plan, which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> dictatorship and that provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> to freely elected governments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, it is also likely to encourage those on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> asking for cuts in the assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Salvador</ENAMEX> if President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cristiani</ENAMEX> does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas.
The sad condition of U.S. policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> is best depicted by the recent end to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> sponsorship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX>. In 1984, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country, flooded by airwaves of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> propaganda. Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX>, funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and affiliated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice of America</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VOA</ENAMEX>).
A few months ago, the Bush administration decided to stop this cooperation, leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Costa Rica</ENAMEX> operating on a shoestring. According to news reports, the abrupt termination was due to fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VOA</ENAMEX> transmissions could interfere with the peace process. In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russia</ENAMEX> gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter, which has been installed in the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Esteli</ENAMEX>. It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default.
The Soviet entrenchment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> is alarming for Costa <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rica</ENAMEX>, a peaceful democracy without an army. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Questioned</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX> voiced expectations of direct U.S. action. A poll conducted in July by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup</ENAMEX> affiliate showed that 64% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Ricans</ENAMEX> believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> will come to its defense. But in the light of events in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has such clear strategic interests, waiting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX> may prove to be a dangerous gambit.
