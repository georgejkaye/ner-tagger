<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> said the tail section of an E-6A jetplane, being readied for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, came apart during a test flight.
It was the second such incident this year. ``A fluke is one thing, but when it happens a second time, obviously we're concerned,'' said a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> aircraft maker. He said investigators were searching for a cause.
The E-6A -- several of which already have been delivered to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> -- uses a trailing antenna to serve as a communications link between command authorities and the nation's Trident submarine fleet. It is a derivative of the 707 airliner.
The latest accident, like the one in February, occurred during a ``flutter test'' in which the pilots apply abrupt changes to the flight-control system. The plane landed safely at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> Field here, with about a quarter of its tail missing.
