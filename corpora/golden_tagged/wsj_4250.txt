Canadian regulators approved the 606 million Canadian dollar (US$513.6 million) purchase by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maclean Hunter Ltd. of Selkirk Communications Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based television and radio broadcaster.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Radio</ENAMEX>-television and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telecommunications Commission</ENAMEX> rejected part of a plan by Maclean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX> to sell some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selkirk</ENAMEX> TV and radio operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maclean Hunter</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based publishing and broadcasting company.
The commission rejected Maclean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX>'s proposal to sell two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edmonton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>, radio stations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westcom Radio Group Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of WIC <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western International Communications Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vancouver</ENAMEX>. The commission said it wasn't satisfied with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westcom</ENAMEX>'s plans for operating the stations.
The regulators also rejected Maclean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX>'s proposal to sell a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>, television station to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackburn Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, a closely held publishing and broadcasting company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>, saying they weren't satisfied with the prospective buyer's plans for strengthening the station's operations.
The panel approved Maclean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX>'s plans to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selkirk</ENAMEX>'s television operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX> and British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western International Communications</ENAMEX> and to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selkirk</ENAMEX>'s radio operations in the same two provinces to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogers Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>
The federal agency ordered Maclean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX> to invest C$21.2 million in a fund to be used to strengthen the Canadian broadcasting system. It said the sum represented the difference between the estimated C$627.2 million value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selkirk</ENAMEX>'s assets and the C$606 million that Maclean <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX> paid for them. The agency opposes capital gains by companies on the purchase and sale of broadcasting assets.
