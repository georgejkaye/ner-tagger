Transportation Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> to reduce a stake held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX>, but he didn't indicate how that will affect a bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> by a group that includes another foreign carrier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> insisted that he isn't setting a new policy for foreign airlines' stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers, only enforcing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation</ENAMEX> Act of 1958, which requires that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines be 75%-owned and controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> citizens.
Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX>'s $400 million stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX> represented only 5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX>'s voting stock, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> said the size of the investment could enable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> to exercise control. He ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> to slash the investment to $176 million, or 25% of the $705 million in equity capital raised for the takeover.
A strict extension of that logic could require changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> role in the bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> would be the largest single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> holder, with 15%, and is contributing 78% of the $965 million in cash equity. But any changes in the offer could upset the bid's fragile balance between labor and management.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> management, led by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf</ENAMEX>, is likely to argue that the $240 million of annual cost concessions in the bid represents roughly $1.5 billion in ``sweat equity'' being contributed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> employees. Pilots who are to own 75%, he could argue, would be the largest holder, and management, with 10%, could exercise control through its right to nominate eight outside directors.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> sought to leave himself room to come down either way on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> question. ``Every company is individual; every one of these transactions will be analyzed on an individual basis,'' he said. He has asked for details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> bid by Oct. 10 -- two or three weeks before the purchase is due to be completed. Both politics and economics are likely to play a role in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX>'s decision. The bidders have on their side the popular idea of employee ownership. On Friday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> said he is ``confident that the proposal for employee ownership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>'' will win approval.
Yet the prospective employee owners of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> are white-collar professional workers, some making more than $150,000 a year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s larger blue-collar machinist union has attacked the plan and threatened to lobby against it. The machinists are scheduled to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> management tomorrow.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> said he plans to consult with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials before outlining his policy on airline buy-outs and foreign ownership at congressional hearings this week.
In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> decision, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>'s new owners, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Checchi</ENAMEX>, ``appear to be exceptionally well qualified to expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>'s operations and improve its quality of service.''
But he also curbed the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX>'s director on the 12-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> board. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> director can't participate in matters where the two airlines compete or in international route negotiations affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM</ENAMEX>.
The action provoked a formal objection from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM</ENAMEX>. But the airline stopped short of saying it would challenge the decision legally, saying it would pursue talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> instead.
The decision gives Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> as long as one year to repurchase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX>'s $225 million in preferred stock, which pays a dividend of 10% the first year, 12% the second and 14% the third. To replace the funds, he probably would have to offer a higher dividend or equity, which would reduce his own stake of more than 50%.
