<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> may be slugging it out in court in one of the most bitter copyright battles high technology has ever seen, but that apparently doesn't mean they can't do business together.
In one of the stranger pairings in the computer business, the two rivals unveiled an agreement yesterday to swap technology on advanced printing fonts. Apple will design new font technology for use in future versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OS</ENAMEX>\ operating-system software. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Redmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, will grant Apple a license to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> printer software in future versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laserwriter</ENAMEX> printer.
The move is aimed at reducing confusion in standards for fonts. Computers currently use a dizzying array of type styles and sizes. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> eventually succeeds in creating an industry standard with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OS</ENAMEX>\ software, which has been slow to catch on, most desktop computers could someday have identical font capabilities.
The alliance could be bad news for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountain View</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, which also makes font technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment, but analysts said rumors of an impending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> hookup had driven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s stock down in recent days. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> shares fell 37.5 cents to close at $20.125.
Many analysts found the news as intriguing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> pairing as for any product it might eventually produce. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cupertino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, has sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> in federal court here for copyright infringement, claiming their products stole the ``look and feel'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s Macintosh computer.
``They make an odd couple,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Lupatkin</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX> here.
