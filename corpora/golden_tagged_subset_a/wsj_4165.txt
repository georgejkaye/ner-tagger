<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spelling Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, which in its heyday produced a gaggle of highly rated but often critically panned series such as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>'s Angels,'' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Love Boat</ENAMEX>,'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dynasty</ENAMEX>,'' has put itself on the block.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spelling</ENAMEX> said it retained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> to look into ``various strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value, including the possible sale of the company.'' Producer and founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Spelling</ENAMEX>, in a release, spoke of ``recent expressions of interest in the company,'' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Lightstone</ENAMEX>, executive vice president, said several companies had inquired about a possible bid but wouldn't specify if an offer is actually on the table.
The ``For Sale'' sign on the entertainment production and distribution company came just six months after control of the firm switched to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Lindner</ENAMEX> from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spelling</ENAMEX>. The move also comes amid pending ownership changes for two larger entertainment concerns, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> which is being purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX>, about to be acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>
Analysts immediately speculated that Spelling might also be acquired by a foreign concern. Since its inception in 1965 Spelling has been one of the largest and most successful producers of popular programming, especially when it had a long-term exclusive agreement to provide all its programming to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC Network</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX> But it currently has no new series on the air. It's last major show, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dynasty</ENAMEX>,'' aired for nine years but was canceled last spring.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spelling</ENAMEX>, however, won its first television ``Emmy'' award recently for a made-for-TV movie, ``Day One,'' about the making of the atomic bomb. The company also produced the critically acclaimed series ``Family.''
One analyst, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Logsdon</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crowell Weedon & Co.</ENAMEX>, said he thinks Spelling could fetch as much as $18 a share, or $595 million, largely because of its library of shows for syndication to independent television stations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and abroad, and the relationships and connections Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spelling</ENAMEX> and the company have built up in the entertainment industry. Also important, he said, is the company's $40 million in annual cash flow and relatively low $55 million in debt.
But two other analysts termed that estimate high, and one, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Kassan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX>, said he believed the company would fetch only $9 to $12 a share, or between $297 million and $397 million for its 33.1 million common shares outstanding. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Isgur</ENAMEX>, an entertainment analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paine Webber Inc.</ENAMEX>, agreed. ``I don't think the company is that attractive,'' he said. ``What sort of ongoing programming do they have? None.''
Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spelling Entertainment</ENAMEX> shares was halted with news pending at $8.25, down 25 cents, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> Friday.
Analysts said that among the companies that might be interested in Spelling are two Japanese concerns, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. Itoh & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. Itoh</ENAMEX> was one of many companies that talked about buying at least an equity interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JVC/Victor Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, which is 50% owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita</ENAMEX>, recently agreed to invest more than $100 million in a joint venture with independent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gordon</ENAMEX> to produce and finance motion pictures.
In a separate but apparently related announcement, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great American Communications Co.</ENAMEX>, which controls 49% of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spelling</ENAMEX>, said it will sell its insurance unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid-Continent Casualty Co.</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Financial Corp.</ENAMEX>, a private company owned by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindner</ENAMEX> and his family, for $80 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great American</ENAMEX> said it also will sell about $30 million of its real-estate assets.
