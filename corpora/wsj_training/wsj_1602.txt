Your Oct. 12 editorial ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pitiful</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Helpless Presidency</ENAMEX>?'' correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3.
You are absolutely wrong, however, in opining that this position is some kind of ``flip-flop,'' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls. My position is one founded on both the facts and the law.
Although you may have forgotten, public opinion about Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling (and simultaneous work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operative). The public made up its mind about Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> on Feb. 8, 9, 10 and 11, 1988, and again on April 4, 1988. It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX>'s criminality, and of his enduring relationships with a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government agencies.
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him, and to exploit the administration's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing. As former Ambassador to Costa Rica <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis J. Mcneil</ENAMEX> testified before the subcommittee, the Reagan administration knew that Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> was involved with narcotics, but made a decision in the summer of 1986 ``to put Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> on the shelf until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> was settled.''
As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded, ``Our government did nothing regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Noriega</ENAMEX>'s drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war. This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> as a hidden cost of the war.''
Unfortunately, this problem continued even after Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX>'s indictment. Throughout 1988 and this year, I and others in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this ``narcokleptocrat'' out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regrettably</ENAMEX>, two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan, military or economic, for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kerry</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>)
