A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker Corp.</ENAMEX> unit has agreed to plead guilty to bribery-related charges and to pay the government about $3 million for the unit's role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> procurement scandal, according to people familiar with the investigation.
These people also said prosecutors have decided to seek an indictment of veteran consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Muldoon</ENAMEX> -- who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> and a batch of larger defense contractors -- on charges including bribery and conspiracy.
Both moves, likely to come as early as today, are expected to provide an important boost for the three-year investigation of alleged corruption and widespread influence-peddling involving defense contracts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> and its lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Bookin</ENAMEX>, declined to discuss the matter. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Ahern</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX>'s lawyer, said his client denies any wrongdoing and ``is planning on going to trial'' on any charges stemming from the scandal.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> had close ties to some of the country's biggest defense contractors, a number of prominent industry consultants and various senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> acquisition officials. Some of his associates are considered to be central targets of the government's inquiry.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> hasn't agreed to cooperate with the government. Still, prosecutors hope that by seeking a sweeping indictment against him, they eventually will force Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> to provide information about the activities of some of those associates.
As part of a settlement worked out yesterday, law enforcement officials and others said the unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> has agreed to pay about $3 million in civil and criminal penalties and fines. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney's office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, has told Whittaker it will file papers charging that the firm used contacts with government officials and various middlemen in an alleged scheme to improperly influence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> contracts stretching back to the mid-1980s.
The case against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX>, according to the law-enforcement officials and other people familiar with the investigation, focuses on inside information that he allegedly obtained illegally about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> air-traffic control and communications contract potentially valued at $120 million. The information eventually was passed on to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys Corp.</ENAMEX> and at least one other company for which he worked which also bid on the contract, according to prosecutors and court documents previously filed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>.
In January, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> said it expected to be charged in the inquiry, code-named ``Operation Ill Wind.'' Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Muller</ENAMEX>, the firm's general counsel, indicated in an interview that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> fired two employees as soon as it was presented with evidence that they had bribed government officials in order to secure information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> contracts. ``As far as we know, anyone affiliated with those payments is no longer affiliated with the company,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muller</ENAMEX> said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> unit currently under investigation was created by the firm's acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee Telecommunications</ENAMEX> in mid-1986. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muller</ENAMEX> and federal investigators said the suspect activities began before the acquisition and continued afterward.
In Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX>'s case, government documents filed or unsealed over the past year in federal courts around the country depict him as a central figure in a covert network of consultants, contractor executives and defense officials who improperly swapped sensitive procurement data that should have stayed within the government. One government affidavit, for instance, indicates that when an associate pressed him to provide more detailed information about the status of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> contract, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> allegedly ``asked... for more money'' and eventually received part of a consulting fee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> paid to another consultant.
A separate government filing indicates that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> allegedly obtained the ``relative positions'' of all of the firms -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> -- initially bidding on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> contract. A fellow consultant who provided Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> with this and other details about the contract warned that the information was ``extraordinarily private,'' according to the same document. The procurement scandal erupted before the contract was awarded.
Action against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> is bound to turn the spotlight on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX>, which has acknowledged it is discussing a separate, multimillion-dollar settlement with the government involving possible charges stemming from the procurement scandal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> officials have said they are demanding as much as $100 million as part of a comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> settlement. But the company has balked at that proposal, and any agreement appears to be at least several weeks away.
