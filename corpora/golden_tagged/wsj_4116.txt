A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Administration</ENAMEX> research scientist said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> must provide more money for the space program or the agency will have to tell the public the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has chosen to be second-rate in space.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Petersen</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langley Research Center</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s early dreams were shattered when the agency's funding fell from 4% of the federal budget in the 1960s to less than 1% in the 1980s.
``Tragically, throughout the 1970s the American public was led to believe that they had the best space program in the world,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersen</ENAMEX> said. ``It is crucial in the future that we either provide the funds to compete as a world-class space power, or that we tell Americans the whole truth -- that this country has chosen not to be a world leader in space.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersen</ENAMEX> spoke at an awards ceremony for several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdue University</ENAMEX> graduates who became astronauts.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersen</ENAMEX>, also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdue graduate</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> scientists in the 1960s envisioned a program that would put men on the moon in the'60s, create a space-shuttle system in the'70s, build a space station in the'80s and put men on Mars in the'90s.
``But somewhere after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>, we lost our way,'' he said. ``Early in the'70s, we shut down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> program, slashed NASA funding by two-thirds and proceeded slowly and timidly to develop the space shuttle.'' Progress on the space station has been even slower, with an operating space base not expected until the late 1990s.
``There are many reasons for our slow progress in exploiting space, but fundamentally I believe we simply weren't given the resources to run a first-class program,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersen</ENAMEX> said.
Now, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has committed the U.S. to launching a space station in the next decade and beginning a new program, Mission to Planet Earth, that will place several large platforms in orbit with instruments to study the land, the seas and the atmosphere.
Between 2000 and 2010, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> will develop a manned base on the moon, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersen</ENAMEX> said, and a manned trip to Mars will follow in the decade from 2010 to 2020.
``To have a world-class space program, we will need to make a long-term investment and double the funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> in the near future, which will be a major political battle,'' he said.
