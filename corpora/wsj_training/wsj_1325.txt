<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana Corp.</ENAMEX> said its third-quarter net income fell 27% to $29.6 million, or 72 cents a share, from $40.7 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. Sales dropped 4% to $1.12 billion from $1.17 billion.
The company, which supplies transmissions and other drive-train parts to auto makers, said about half the earnings drop came from the ``virtual collapse'' of the Venezuelan auto industry. The Venezuelan currency plummeted this year, making it difficult for auto makers there to afford imported parts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana</ENAMEX> also said it was hurt by slumping U.S. truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier.
The company, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toledo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Anne Sudol</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch Investors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost ``across the board.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southwood J. Morcott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana</ENAMEX>'s president, said the company's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength.
