A series of explosions tore through the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> plastics plant near here, injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> Ship Channel.
There were no immediate reports of deaths, but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bartlesville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okla.</ENAMEX>, oil company late yesterday still hadn't said officially what caused the explosions and fires, which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air. One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant's reactors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Cox</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX>' president and chief operating officer, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> officials flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bartlesville</ENAMEX> to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions.
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips Petroleum</ENAMEX> shares fell $1.125 to $23.125.
The plastics plant is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Gulf</ENAMEX> Coast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> closed six miles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> Ship Channel, where about 150 companies have operations, because the thick, black smoke obscured the area. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port of Houston</ENAMEX> closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo.
Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters' efforts, but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control. The blasts blew out windows, spewed debris for miles and crumpled the ceiling in an area elementary school. The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>, about 10 miles away.
Nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pasadena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, police reported that 104 people had been taken to area hospitals, but a spokeswoman said that toll could rise. The injured, including three in critical condition, were treated for burns, breathing problems and cuts from flying glass, hospital officials said. The plant employs between 800 and 900 on three shifts. The number working at the time of the blast wasn't known.
Yesterday's explosions were the second round in two months at the plastics plant. In late August, four contract workers were injured and one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility's boiler house.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> facility manufactures polyethylene, polypropylene and K-resin, plastics used in a wide array of applications, including milk jugs and toys. Plastics are the cornerstone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips</ENAMEX>' chemicals operations, which is the biggest single contributor to the company's profits.
