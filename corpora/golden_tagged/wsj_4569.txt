the biggest rise for any stock on any exchange yesterday -- in frenzied trading that triggered an explosive rally in other publicly traded funds that invest in a single country.
But the rise, which was fueled by continued strong buying by Japanese investors, is triggering charges by some of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>'s savviest traders that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund is the subject of blatant manipulation.
``It's my feeling that Japanese brokerage firms are ganging up on'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund to drive up its price, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Steinhardt</ENAMEX>, who runs a well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investment fund. ``And what they are doing is ultimately not in the best interest of their clients.''
The price rise is ``absolute insanity,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Chanos</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kynikos Associates</ENAMEX> and another well-known investor.
Both Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steinhardt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chanos</ENAMEX> have sold short shares of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund. That means they have sold borrowed stock, betting that the shares will fall and they can later buy them back at a lower price.
Short sellers have been battered by the tremendous surge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund, which soared 37% last week on the back of strong Japanese buying; the fund's shares are up a phenomenal 265% this year.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund rose $12 a share to close at $38.75.
Yesterday's frenetic activity spilled into other so-called single-country funds. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> Fund soared 25%, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaysia Fund</ENAMEX> jumped 18%, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thai Fund</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Pacific Fund</ENAMEX> both rose about 15%.
What is so extraordinary about the runup is that many of these funds now trade at extremely fat premiums to the underlying value of the foreign stocks in their portfolios. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund now stands at an unprecedented 165% premium, the largest premium of any publicly traded fund. The single-country funds sell a fixed number of shares to investors and use the money to buy foreign stocks -- Spanish stocks in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund. These so-called closed-end funds trade at a premium or, more typically, a discount to the value of the stocks they hold.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund's explosive 265% rise has stunned many traders because the Spanish stocks in its portfolio are up only 30% this year. Other country funds, too, have soared far above the value of their underlying stock assets.
The reason, traders say, is heavy buying by Japanese investors urged by big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> securities firms. The firms have been pushing the investment theme of the pending 1992 abolition of trade barriers between the 12 countries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>, which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. They have also touted the bright economic prospects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>.
Yesterday's rally triggered a wave of buying by investors and speculators who were caught in a ``short squeeze'' because they had earlier  sold <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund shares short, betting the stock would fall. Instead, the explosive run-up left them scrambling to cut their losses by buying shares to replace those borrowed earlier. That buying, in turn, fueled further price increases.
Volume in the fund yesterday was 1.4 million shares, more than 10 times normal turnover.
Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance Capital Management Corp.</ENAMEX>, which manages the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund, said there ``are no fundamental developments to justify the price action.'' But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Williams</ENAMEX>, Alliance chairman, said: ``It's clearly another short squeeze.''
But Alliance officials said the firm doesn't plan to issue any more fund shares. ``We're really in a bind,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> said, adding: ``We continue to believe this is a technical aberration in the market.''
Indeed, analysts say the huge premium at which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund and others are now trading leaves investors vulnerable. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund trades on no fundamentals at all; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> Fund could end up like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hindenburg</ENAMEX>,'' warned analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Cress</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is conducting an inquiry into the activities of several large Japanese securities firms that have been doing the trading. But officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> yesterday refused to elaborate. ``We are conducting an analysis of the trading activity, and will take appropriate action, if necessary,'' a spokeswoman said.
In the last few days, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Securities Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yamaichi Securities Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities Co.</ENAMEX> and possibly other firms have received letters from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> compliance department. Two firms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>, said that they are in the process of gathering information to respond to the letters, which involved trading in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund.
Japanese investors may have pumped up the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund and other country funds in the past two weeks. But Japanese securities firms contended that their trading volume was nowhere near enough to account for the 12-point advance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund yesterday.
An executive at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX>'s U.S. unit said that his firm accounted for about a third of the total 1.44 million shares traded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund yesterday, ``not enough to be responsible for a 10 to 12 point runup'' that occurred earlier in the day. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund has 10 million shares outstanding.
Another of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s so-called Big Four securities companies -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa Securities Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yamaichi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> -- said his firm was responsible for only 5% of the turnover. A senior executive at a third firm said: ``We've not been active on the buy side.''
Executives at several of the Japanese firms argued that they were taking unwarranted criticism, both from short-sellers crying over having made a bad bet and from U.S. investors ignorant of the way Japanese investors look at stocks.
Explaining the Japanese penchant for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> as well as other country funds, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> spokesman said: ``Individual Japanese investors look at this as a three-year investment; they are looking to 1992.''
Nonetheless, an investor could buy the approximately 50 individual stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund's portfolio in the Spanish stock market at well below half the price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund. That doesn't include trading commissions and the difficulties of settling trades in the Spanish market.
There are some country funds, unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund, that trade at premiums to their asset values because foreign investors aren't allowed to buy stocks directly in those countries.
