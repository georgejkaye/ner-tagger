<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen Corp.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connecticut Superior Court</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas A. Cioffi</ENAMEX> issued an order temporarily enjoining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron Corp.</ENAMEX> from pursuing any further proposals to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>.
The order also enjoined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX>, a closely held industrial electronics company, from acquiring any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> stock in violation of a standstill agreement between the parties. The accord was reached as part of a merger agreement in April in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Simsbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, maker of electronic, industrial and defense products, for $320 million. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> pulled out, citing unexpected ``adverse changes.''
The court's order Friday was issued pending a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for Oct. 17. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James E. Swiggett</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>, said he was ``gratified'' by the court's decision. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> officials couldn't be reached for comment.
