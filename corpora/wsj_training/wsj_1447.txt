<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> cigarette brand has been losing market share, has asked at least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account, which has been at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich Greene Inc.</ENAMEX> since 1966.
Executives close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> said that the tobacco and food giant has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX>, and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account. Several executives said another potential contender is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> agency, which works on some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> products. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> declined to comment. A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> said the agency doesn't comment on ``idle speculation.''
Also mentioned as a contender was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBWA Advertising</ENAMEX>, but the company denied it was participating.
The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns, as well as one of its largest clients. The account billed almost $60 million last year, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leading National Advertisers</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year, industry executives said, and it now bills about $30 million to $40 million.
Industry executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand's slipping market share. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Maxwell</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheat First Securities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> has slipped from 4.7% of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1% after the second quarter of this year. The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> said. The slip has come despite high-profile ads created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX>, including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch. That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> first popularized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying, among other things, an elevator door closing on a passenger's cigarette. The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its staid performance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX>, trying to revive the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> franchise, put the account up for review in 1986. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich Greene</ENAMEX>, however, in an effort directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Wells Lawrence</ENAMEX>, emerged the victor of the review and retained the business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Olshan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX>'s chairman, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> recently picked up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hertz Corp.</ENAMEX>'s $25 million to $30 million account, it has lost a number of big accounts this year, including the $20 million to $25 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadbury-Schweppes Canada</ENAMEX> Dry and Sunkist accounts, the $18 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble Co.</ENAMEX> Sure deodorant account and the $10 million Polo/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX> business. Its victories include more than $30 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton Corp.</ENAMEX> business and an assignment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dun & Bradstreet</ENAMEX> worth $5 million to $10 million.
