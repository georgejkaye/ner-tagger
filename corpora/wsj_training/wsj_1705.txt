The scene opens with pinstripe-suited executives -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Easterners</ENAMEX>, obviously -- glued to cellular phones and hightailing it out of town in chauffeur-driven limousines.
``The carpetbaggers,'' snorts the narrator with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> twang, ``have packed their bags and went.'' But, he continues, ``They're forgetting we're all Texans. The Lone Star is on the rise again.''
As the music swells, viewers discover they're watching a commercial for Lone Star Beer, the pride of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, a product of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. Heileman Brewing Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Crosse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wis.</ENAMEX>, unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>
As the ad's tone implies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> spirit is pretty xenophobic these days, and Lone Star isn't alone in trying to take advantage of that. From Chevy trucks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipton</ENAMEX> iced tea to a host of battling banks, the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texans</ENAMEX> and castigating outsiders.
While advertisers have long appealed to Texans' state pride and prejudices, the latest trend has been sparked, in part, by the state's recent hard economic times. That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> is the only state that was once a nation, but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders. In the past, writes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> Chronicle columnist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Barlow</ENAMEX>, outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the ``right'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> attitudes and ``of course they had to be dipped for parasites.''
There is no small irony in the fact that some of the most-jingoistic advertising comes courtesy of -- you guessed it -- outsiders. Lone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> parent, for instance, hails from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Perth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolinians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Yorkers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Californians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicagoans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohioans</ENAMEX> own <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> banks. All kinds of landmark <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> real estate has been snapped up by out-of-staters. Even the beloved <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> Cowboys were bought by an Arkansas oil man.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> has lost its distinctiveness, leaving Texans with a hunger to feel proud about themselves,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Klineberg</ENAMEX>, a sociology professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>. ``This plays right into the hands of the advertising agencies.''
For example, the iced-tea radio campaign for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas J. Lipton Co.</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Englewood Cliffs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Dutch Unilever Group</ENAMEX>, emphatically proclaims: ``Real Texans do not wear dock-siders -- ever. Real Texans don't play paddleball, at least I hope not. This is football country. And another thing -- real Texans drink <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipton</ENAMEX> iced tea.''
In developing that theme at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic Group of Cos.</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lintas</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX> unit, account supervisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Buksbaum</ENAMEX> says she made a ``couple of phone calls'' to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> ad friends and reported her ``findings'' to a team of writers. Her findings? ``You know,'' she says, ``stereotypical stuff like armadillos, cowboys and football.''
Not exactly sophisticated market research, but who cares as long as the campaigns work. And ad agencies insist that they do. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stan Richards of Richards Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, tells of the Texan who saw the agency's tear-jerking commercial for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B.</ENAMEX> -- complete with the state's anthem -- and promptly invested $100,000 in the thrift's Cds. Never mind that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Gibraltar</ENAMEX> is one of the failed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> thrifts taken over by outsiders -- in this case, an investor group headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Perelman</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Texas</ENAMEX> Chevy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dealers</ENAMEX> recently had a record sales month after the debut of ad campaign that thumbs its nose at elite <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Easterners</ENAMEX>. And deposits at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB Texas National Bank</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, have increased $2 billion since last year after heavy advertising stressing commitment to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. ``Obviously, pride sells in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>,'' says a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bozell Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Neb.</ENAMEX>, which represents
The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks -- stressing the company's `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Texasness</ENAMEX>,' pointing out the competition's lack thereof, or trying to be more Texan than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texans</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>,'' sniffs a commercial for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX>, a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> The commercial, created by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bateman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bryan & Galles Inc.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, adds derisively: ``I bet it takes a real tough truck to haul your Ivy League buddies to the yacht club.'' Because they want a truck that is ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> tough,'' the commercial concludes, ``Texans drive Chevy.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.C. Penney Co.</ENAMEX>, which relocated from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> to suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> two years ago, gently wraps itself in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> pride through a full-page magazine ad: ``Taking the long-range view to conserve what is of value to future generations is part of the Lone Star lifestyle,'' the ad reads. ``It's part of our style, too.''
According to several ad-agency sources, newcomers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> banking market are spending a combined $50 million this year to woo <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texans</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> banking institutions are busily pitching themselves as the only lenders who truly care about the state.
The most-strident anti-outsider sentiment among bankers comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent Bankers Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, although it's hard to tell from previews of the $5 million ``The I's  of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>'' TV campaign. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercials</ENAMEX> will highlight heart-rending scenes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and chest-swelling, ain't-it-great-to-be-a-Texan music. Supporting banks will sign a ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Declaration of Independents.</ENAMEX>''
But in introductory material for the campaign, the trade group urges members to ``arm'' for a ``revolution'' against big, out-of-state bank-holding companies. A video sent to association members, featuring shots of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alamo</ENAMEX>, cowboys, fajitas and a statue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Houston</ENAMEX>, doesn't mince words. ``Texans can sniff a phony a mile away,'' the narrator warns outsiders. ``So, don't come and try to con us with a howdy y'all or a cowboy hat.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>'s Pact
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>, fighting charges that it bribed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaican</ENAMEX> officials to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica Tourist Board</ENAMEX> ad account in 1981, said it will no longer create the tourist board's advertising.
In a statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kroll</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>'s chairman, said ``under the present circumstances {we} have agreed that it is prudent to discontinue that contract.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX> has pleaded innocent to the charges. The board wouldn't comment on its impending search for a new ad agency to handle its estimated $5 million to $6 million account.
Ad Notes....
NEW ACCOUNT: Sunshine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biscuits Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Woodbridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, awarded its estimated $5 million account to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waring & Larosa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. The account had been at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Della Femina Mcnamee WCRS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
MEDIA POLICY: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macnamara Clapp & Klein</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> shop, is asking magazine ad representatives to tell it when major advertising inserts will run in their publications. It says it may pull its clients' ads from those magazines.
COKE ADS: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> said it produced a new version of its 1971 ``I'd like to teach the world to sing'' commercial. The ad is part of Classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>'s 1990 ad campaign, with the tag line, ``Can't beat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Real Thing.</ENAMEX>'' Basketball star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX> and singer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Travis</ENAMEX> have also agreed to appear in ads.
