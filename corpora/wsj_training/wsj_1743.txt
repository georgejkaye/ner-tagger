<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> said the question of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX> should be considered only after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s own membership in the 97-nation organization is restored.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> are seeking seats in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX>, which sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements and sets world-commerce rules. ``As one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s provinces, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has no right to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX> on its own,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Zhaoxing</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, under the Nationalist government of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiang Kai-shek</ENAMEX>, was a founding member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX> in 1947. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationalists</ENAMEX> withdrew in 1950, after their flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, and the Communist government in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> applied for restoration of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s membership in July 1986.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has voiced opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX> membership, saying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has yet to undertake needed economic reforms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s biggest women's underwear maker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wacoal Corp.</ENAMEX>, said that it developed a sports car that it plans to market in two years. The ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiotto Caspita</ENAMEX>'' can run at over 188 miles an hour, a company spokesman said. The base price of the car is estimated at 30 million yen (about $213,000). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wacoal</ENAMEX> said it intends to produce the cars through a car manufacturer. Along with the car, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wacoal</ENAMEX> plans to launch a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caspita</ENAMEX>-brand men's underwear. ``Our image is a company that makes women's products,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wacoal</ENAMEX> spokesman. ``Now, we're going to sell to men.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British satirical magazine Private Eye</ENAMEX> won an appeal against the size of a $960,000 libel award to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonia Sutcliffe</ENAMEX>, the estranged wife of the ``Yorkshire Ripper'' mass murderer. An appeals-court panel slashed all but $40,000 from the award, the largest ever set by a British jury, pending a reassessment of the damages. But the panel dismissed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX>'s contention that it hadn't libeled Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutcliffe</ENAMEX> when it accused her of trying to sell her story to capitalize on the notoriety of her husband. Private Eye had been threatened with closure because it couldn't afford the libel payment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senshukai Co.</ENAMEX>, a travel agent based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Osaka</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, announced that it and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissho Iwai Corp.</ENAMEX>, a major Japanese trading house, will jointly build a 130-unit condominium in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queensland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senshukai</ENAMEX> said the partners plan to rent to tourists but will also sell to interested parties. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senshukai</ENAMEX> has a 60% stake in the venture and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissho Iwai</ENAMEX> has the rest. Construction of the 34-floor building will begin next May and should be completed in April 1992. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Units</ENAMEX> will cost from 500,000 to 3.5 million Australian dollars (about US$386,000 to US$2.7 million).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has halted construction of two Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors and is reassessing the future of 12 other existing reactors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viktor Sidorenko</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Committee on Nuclear Safety</ENAMEX>, said the two reactors were at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kursk</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Smolensk</ENAMEX>. News of the halt comes amid growing anger in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ukraine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Byelorussia</ENAMEX> over continuing high levels of radiation from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chernobyl</ENAMEX>.
A former vice president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.</ENAMEX> was charged in court yesterday on 19 counts of cheating. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Dang</ENAMEX>, 41, is alleged to have been involved in cheating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> of up to 2.1 million <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> dollars (US$1.1 million) by carrying out unauthorized transactions on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Commodities Exchange</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Petroleum Exchange</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dang</ENAMEX> is alleged to have used the account of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> hotel and property magnate Ong <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beng Seng</ENAMEX> to effect the transactions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> says its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil, coal and gas to cap emissions of carbon dioxide.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> official said that a study found that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8% if carbon-dioxide emissions remained at this year's level of 300 million tons. The study will support arguments against capping carbon-dioxide emissions that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> will make at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>-backed conference on atmospheric pollution next month.
The study said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s carbon-dioxide emissions would slightly more than double by 2010 unless the nation reduced its dependence on fossil fuels. It said that expanding nuclear-power capability is the quickest way to lessen that dependence.
But increased reliance on nuclear power would meet stiff opposition from environmentalists, a second ministry official said.
Just in time for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Halloween</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxford University</ENAMEX> Press is publishing a ``Dictionary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superstitions.</ENAMEX>'' The books 1,500  entries include stepping on cracks and knocking on wood.... In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX>'s tiny township of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaitaia</ENAMEX>, which has had direct dialing for less than a year, about 30 angry phone-company customers questioned the size of their bills. It turned out their children had been dialing a ``sex fantasy'' service in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
