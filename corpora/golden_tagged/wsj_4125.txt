The budget-reconciliation bill pending before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Representatives</ENAMEX> contains a provision that would allow another ``agency'' borrower, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Postal Service</ENAMEX>, to enter the capital markets.
The measure, which would remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> from the federal budget, would bar the agency from borrowing from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX> and would open the door for it to go to the private capital markets as well as to invest in government securities and deposit its funds in private institutions.
The measure gradually would boost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s debt limit to $30 billion from the current $10 billion by fiscal 1996. It would permit the agency to repay existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX> loans without penalty starting six months after enactment of the bill. It also would exempt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> bonds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> registration.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> has sold one bond issue to the public, in 1972, according to the report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> reconciliation bill. Since then, it has borrowed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX>, an entity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> created in the 1970s in part to purchase ``agency debt'' to keep agency borrowers from tripping over each other in the private capital markets and to borrow at the lowest costs possible.
The federal bank's operations are financed by direct Treasury borrowing, which costs less than agency borrowings.
In recent years, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has created a number of new agency borrowers including the new off-budget entity known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Refcorp</ENAMEX>, which is authorized to borrow $30 billion to fund the thrift-industry rescue.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> is authorized to borrow as much as $10 billion to finance capital projects and to defray operating expenses. The reconciliation bill would raise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s debt limit to $15 billion for fiscal 1990 and 1991, $20 billion for fiscal 1992 and 1993, $25 billion for fiscal 1994 and 1995 and $30 billion for fiscal 1996 and thereafter.
Explaining why the measure would exempt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> securities from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> registration, the report on the bill said the ``registration requirements and procedures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> would be wasteful and duplicative in the case of entities, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>, which are otherwise subject to financial controls and disclosure requirements under federal law.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> would have to consult with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> on the timing and terms of its bond sales.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> estimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX>'s cost of borrowing from the public would be higher than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s borrowing cost.
