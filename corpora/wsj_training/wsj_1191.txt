The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> said it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imo Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> from acquiring the shares outstanding of the U.S. unit of the British company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Scientific Holdings PLC</ENAMEX>, for $69 million.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> said it ``had reason to believe that the proposed acquisition could substantially reduce competition'' in the production of certain image intensifier tubes, which are important components of night-vision devices sold primarily to the defense industry.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> said it would seek to enjoin the proposed acquisition in a federal trial court, but declined to specify which one. Under federal law, if the court grants a preliminary injunction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> must begin administrative proceedings to determine the legality of the proposed stock purchase within 20 days.
Officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Scientific</ENAMEX> unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optic-Electronic Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imo Industries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lawrenceville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, couldn't be reached for comment.
