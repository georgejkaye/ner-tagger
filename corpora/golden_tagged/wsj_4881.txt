<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> voters re-elected Premier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bourassa</ENAMEX> and his Liberal Party government handily but he will face a stronger and much louder opposition contingent in the 125-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly</ENAMEX> when it reconvenes later this fall.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>, 56 years old, said he felt ``very well, very happy'' as he left his home last night to go to his campaign headquarters.
According to preliminary returns, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberal Party</ENAMEX> was leading or elected in 92 districts, or ridings, the separatist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX> was leading or elected in 29 ridings, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equality Party</ENAMEX>, a new party that ran candidates in English-speaking districts, was leading or elected in four ridings.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>'s victory was expected. The apparent victories of the protest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equality Party</ENAMEX> weren't. While opinion polls late in the campaign gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equality Party</ENAMEX> a majority of English-speaking voters -- traditionally strong Liberal supporters -- in a handful of ridings, most analysts hadn't expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equality Party</ENAMEX> to win any seats.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX>, helped by leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Parizeau</ENAMEX>'s surprisingly strong campaign performance, boosted its share of the popular vote to 40% from 38.6% in the December 1985 election. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX>' 29 seats compare with the 23 seats it won in 1985, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly</ENAMEX> had 122 seats.
