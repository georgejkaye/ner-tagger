The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> suburb's zoning ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped.
This would be the department's first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under 1988 amendments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fair Housing Act</ENAMEX>. Under those amendments, which took effect in March of this year, the federal government can intervene in private housing-discrimination lawsuits.
The ordinance, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moon Township</ENAMEX>, prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility. In papers filed with the federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> alleged that the ordinance, by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township, makes housing unavailable on account of handicap. The private suit was brought by three mentally retarded people who live in a group home in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Smith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX> Township manager, said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing ``the character and flavor of the neighborhood.'' He said the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded. ``Our intent is to spread them out'' to insure they are well integrated into the community, he said.
