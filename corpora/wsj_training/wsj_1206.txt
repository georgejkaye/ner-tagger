Next to Kohlberg <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis Roberts</ENAMEX>'s megabillion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> deal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI Television</ENAMEX> is small fry.
But the troubles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV are a classic tale of the leveraged buy-out excesses of the 1980s, especially the asset-stripping game.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>, which expects to release a plan to restructure $1.3 billion of debt in the next day or so, isn't just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt -- though it did do that. The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBO</ENAMEX>, a set of assets that were leveraged twice, enabling the blue-chip buy-out king <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kravis</ENAMEX> in 1987 to take more than $1 billion of cash out of the com - pany.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s buy-out was an ace in the hole for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> and for investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KKR</ENAMEX> partnerships. But it has left holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s junk bonds holding the bag, including some heavyweights that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> might need to finance future deals, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Savings & Loan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>.
Some junk-holders are said to be considering legal action against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KKR</ENAMEX> or moves to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV into bankruptcy court. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX>'s majority partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s buy-out, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gillett</ENAMEX>, also is said to be very unhappy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s six stations once were part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storer Communications</ENAMEX>. KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out, then later sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storer</ENAMEX>'s cable operations at a fat profit.
In 1987, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> for the second time piled debt onto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storer</ENAMEX>'s TV stations, selling them for $1.3 billion to a new entity that was 45%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and 55%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillett Corp.</ENAMEX>, which now operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV stations. In this second LBO, KKR with one hand took more than $1 billion of cash out of the TV company's assets and moved it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Storer</ENAMEX> cable operations, making them more valuable in a 1988 sale. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storer</ENAMEX> also took $125 million of junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV bonds as partial payment for the TV assets.)
With the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> put back into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV less than 10% of the cash it had taken out, buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV common and preferred shares.
So, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> today has an estimated $250 million sunk in now-shaky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV, including equity and debt, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LBO</ENAMEX> firm still is $1 billion ahead on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV buy-out after taking cash up front. On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Storer</ENAMEX> as a whole, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> racked up compound annual returns of 60% in the three years it owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storer.</ENAMEX>
Meanwhile, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> risks losing his entire equity investment of about $100 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV if the company can't be restructured. Overall, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX>'s holding company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillett Holdings</ENAMEX>, is heavily indebted and, except for its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vail</ENAMEX> Mountain resorts, isn't doing very well.
With the TV business falling on hard times in recent years, analysts say that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV had to be liquidated today, it might fetch 30% less than in the 1987 buy-out, wiping out most of the company's junk-holders and its stockholders. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV can barely pay its cash interest bill, and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s grace period for paying its bills is due to expire Nov. 16. It now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt. Negotiations ``have started con - structively, but that's not to say we like this particular offer,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Ross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothschild Inc.</ENAMEX>, adviser to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV junk-holders.
No major player in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV deal will talk publicly. But it's understood that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> is disappointed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> didn't manage to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s operating profit after the buy-out. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> apparently thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV to sell assets to pay debt. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> is said to be proud of his operating record; he has lifted some stations' ratings and turned around a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> station.
As for junk-holders, they're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX>. The bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.D. Smith & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, which trades distressed securities.
People who have seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s restructuring plan say it offers concessions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillett Corp.</ENAMEX> They would both give part of their combined $50 million in common equity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV to holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s $488 million of junk bonds, as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company.
But some militant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV junk-holders say that's not enough. They contend that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s equity now is worthless. They add that it isn't costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out, which they think contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s current problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemper</ENAMEX>, the biggest holder of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV bonds, has refused to join the bond-holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options.
To protect their claims, some junk-holders want KKR and perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> to invest new money in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV, perhaps $50 million or more. One investment banker who isn't involved in the deal says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV needs at least $50 million of new equity to survive.
Junk-holders say they have a stick to beat KKR with: ``The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool'' to extract money from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KKR</ENAMEX>, says one big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV holder. This could be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX>, he adds. A big bankruptcy-court case might tarnish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX>'s name, and provide new fuel for critics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lbos</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and elsewhere. But others say junk-holders have nothing to gain by putting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV into bankruptcy-law proceedings.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> doesn't control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI Tvwhich</ENAMEX> is unusual for a KKR investment -- it clearly has much deeper pockets than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX>. Bankruptcy specialists say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> set a precedent for putting new money in sour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lbos</ENAMEX> recently when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> restructured foundering Seaman Furniture, doubling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX>'s equity stake.
But with Seaman, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> was only trying to salvage its original investment, says bankruptcy investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rubin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sass</ENAMEX> Lamle <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> probably has already made all the money it can on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV. And people who know Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> say he isn't in a hurry to pour more money into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV.
