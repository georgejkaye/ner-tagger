Lost Generation?
Geographical ignorance harms our nation's business,
For today it's sad to report,
Yuppie types think the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> Rim's found
On a Chinese basketball court.

Hand Shaken
From enthusiastic greeting
I now cease and desist --
That's since a ``high five''
Almost broke my wrist.
