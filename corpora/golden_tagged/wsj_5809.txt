A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> executive told analysts here that the strength shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations in the second quarter continued through August.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Lautenbach</ENAMEX>, general manager of the computer giant's U.S. operations, also told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery Securities</ENAMEX> conference that the company's U.S. revenue will increase this year compared to last year's level. It would be the first time since 1985 that the U.S. revenue has shown growth for a full year. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lautenbach</ENAMEX> added, however, that the growth is ``not as rapid as we would like.''
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s second-quarter results showed the first significant revenue growth in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations in years, some securities analysts had speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> pulled out all the stops to make that happen and that it wouldn't be able to sustain that pace. So Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lautenbach</ENAMEX>'s statements should allay some of those concerns.
``To hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is good is very encouraging,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Stevens</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lautenbach</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Armonk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, company still faces problems that are making its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations grow more slowly than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. He said these difficulties include ``problems getting new products out the door,'' relatively slow growth in software and a need to further increase the time that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s marketing force spends in the field.
In addition, the bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s third-quarter business is typically done in September, so the real test will be what happens this month.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Mandresh</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>, also cautioned that there are numerous other factors involved. He said that, for instance, if the dollar's value stays unchanged through year end, the dollar will be 17% higher against the yen in the fourth quarter compared with its level in the year-ago period. That would mean a corresponding reduction in the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars.
Some analysts have, in fact, expressed caution in recent days about the outlook for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s second half because of concern that the dollar's strength may hurt fourth-quarter results even more than previously projected.
