Quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmics Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a generic drug unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products Corp.</ENAMEX>, has stopped shipping products and suspended operations because of a federal investigation into information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> didn't identify the drugs in question, but said ``some data appears to have been misrepresented to the agency during the approval process.''
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home</ENAMEX> spokeswoman confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> has temporarily closed because of an internal investigation that began last month as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s ongoing inquiry.
Earlier this summer, Quantum was described in testimony before a congressional subcommittee headed by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> as having a ``cozy relationship'' with an ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> official who speeded up drug approvals for some companies while penalizing others.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> Democrat, indicated that his investigators plan to further investigate Quantum, including its acquisition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home.</ENAMEX> In a letter yesterday to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home's</ENAMEX> chief executive officer, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> asked for copies of reports and analysis related to the Quantum transaction, as well as other internal documents.
The Quantum shutdown marks the third generic drug maker to at least temporarily halt some production in the wake of beefed up FDA industry surveillance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par Pharmaceutical Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spring Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitarine Pharmaceutical Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Springfield Gardens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, each stopped making some products as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> scrutiny of manufacturing facilities and drug approvals.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home</ENAMEX> spokeswoman described the Quantum shutdown as ``a voluntary and temporary suspension. Nothing has come to our attention about the safety and efficacy of our products,'' she added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amityville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, makes about 20 products. About half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX>'s 100 employees were laid off as a result of the closing, the spokeswoman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home</ENAMEX>, involved in anti-generic drug campaigns over the years, surprised some industry executives when it acquired controlling interest in Quantum in 1986. The company then was only three years old.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home</ENAMEX> has interests in prescription and over-the-counter drugs, medical supplies and food and household products.
Quantum was among a handful of companies cited for enjoying special treatment from former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> reviewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Y. Chang</ENAMEX> in House subcommittee testimony from Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Seife</ENAMEX>, former head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s generic division.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seife</ENAMEX> testified that he began diverting Quantum's drug applications away from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> in 1986 to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest or favoritism. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seife</ENAMEX> said he became suspicious of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX>'s ties to Quantum because one of the company's former officers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jin-Shung Chang</ENAMEX>, spoke in Chinese with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Chang</ENAMEX>.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seife</ENAMEX> also testified that he wouldn't have promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Chang</ENAMEX> to supervisor over seven other reviewers had he been informed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jin-Shung Chang</ENAMEX>, while working at another drug company, gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Chang</ENAMEX> a case of wine and a fur coat for his wife in 1980. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seife</ENAMEX> testified that he didn't know such allegations to be true until he was read a report this past year by a Dingell subcommittee investigator.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> was allowed to return those items, saying he didn't realize that accepting such gifts violated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> guidelines, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seife</ENAMEX> testified. ``I think he was given a letter of admonition and the matter dropped.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Chang</ENAMEX> is one of three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> employees who resigned from the agency and pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to helping certain generic drug companies obtain approvals to market generic versions of brand-name drugs. He pleaded guilty in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> federal court to two counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX>'s charges involve accepting a paid, round-the-world trip that cost more than $3,000 from a consultant at the direction of the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Therapeutics Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bohemia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX> ATI's president also purchased furniture and computer equipment for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> totaling almost $8,000. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATI</ENAMEX> nor its officers have been charged with any crime, and the company has denied any wrongdoing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jin-Shung Chang</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home</ENAMEX> stock rose 25 cents yesterday to close at $100.375 a share in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
