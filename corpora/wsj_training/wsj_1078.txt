Italian car manufacturer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> said it isn't interested in partnership or industrial cooperation with Swedish auto and aerospace group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab-Scania AB</ENAMEX>, which faces heavy losses in its car division.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> said it's only interested in technical cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX>.
``We know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX> is looking for a partner for industrial and financial cooperation,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> said. ``But that partner isn't Fiat.''
The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>, but declined to comment on rumors that it was planning to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>'s car division.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX>'s rejection of partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX> means that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish company</ENAMEX>, which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49%, will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> have turned down the offer.
News reports said yesterday that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX> is trying to start negotiations with French automakers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX>.
