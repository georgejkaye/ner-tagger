Stateswest Airlines said it submitted an offer to the directors of Mesa Airlines to acquire the Farmington, N.M., carrier.
Except to characterize its offer as ``fair and generous and in the best interests of Mesa shareholders,'' Stateswest declined to discuss details of its proposal. It also asked Mesa to keep the proposal confidential. A Mesa official confirmed receipt of the offer and said directors would meet to consider it.
Last week, Mesa rejected a proposal by Stateswest to acquire it or merge.
Stateswest has a 7.25% stake in Mesa, which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado and Texas.
Stateswest operates four twin-engine turboprop aircraft, connecting 10 cities in California, Arizona and Nevada. The carrier hasn't yet turned a profit.
