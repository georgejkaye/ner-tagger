A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> unit's issue of warrants for the stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> marks the first time a third party has sold warrants for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> company's shares, and might lead to further such offerings, analysts said.
The warrant offering in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers International Ltd.</ENAMEX> is an attempt by the investment house to capitalize on interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> stock market. The warrants' popularity could be aided by persistent rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> may merge with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland Bank PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salomon</ENAMEX> said that wasn't a reason for the issue.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Hannam</ENAMEX>, who arranged the issue for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> was selected because it is a blue-chip company and its performance closely matches that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> market as a whole.
A warrant gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy stock at a fixed price. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> warrant gives the holder the right to buy one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> share for 6.40 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> dollars (82 U.S. cents) within two years. The bank's stock closed yesterday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> at HK$6.30.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> issued 43 million warrants this week at HK$1.32 apiece, making them profitable if the stock's price rises above HK$7.72. Stock-market analysts said the warrants will be popular with investors who want to limit the money they invest initially and still take advantage of price gains on the volatile <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> said the warrants were sold mainly to European investors. The investment bank has targeted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as its main market initially because of the success of similar instruments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> in the past two years and because of difficulties and delays in issuing a new instrument in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
Government officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> were unavailable for comment on whether they would allow a third-party issue to be listed in the colony. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> companies have issued warrants on their own shares, and these warrants trade locally.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannam</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> is ``committed to making a secondary market'' in the warrants. Analysts said liquidity in the secondary market will be essential in convincing third parties to take the risk of issuing warrants.
A successful issue might be followed by offerings of warrants on a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s biggest and most international companies and might open up a new area of business for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s merchant banks, analysts said. They noted, however, that the number would be limited because the shares of only a few companies are liquid enough to sustain a secondary market in warrants.
``We believe there's a lot of interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> market. We would like to issue more,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannam</ENAMEX>.
The warrants issued this week are covered in that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> has access to enough <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> shares to back them; the investment house has bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> stock or options to buy the shares from other institutions, a spokesman said. Some analysts were surprised by the issue because of the risk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> may take in obtaining access to 43 million shares of the bank's stock.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannam</ENAMEX> wouldn't say how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> shares <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> had bought outright. ``There are many ways of hedging this,'' he said.
For investors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> is attractive because there have been rumors that the bank is preparing to move its headquarters out of the colony by arranging a merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland Bank</ENAMEX> before 1997, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> will return to Chinese control. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> is the largest shareholder in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>, with a 14.9% stake, and after a standstill agreement expires in December 1990, it can alter its stake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> officials have said they are committed to staying in the territory, but in recent statements they haven't ruled out the possibility of a merger in the future if it makes commercial sense for the two banks.
``The big attraction'' of the warrants ``is if all the talk about a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX> merger comes true,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Sandlund</ENAMEX>, a stock analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyndall International Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> brokerage company. A rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX>'s share price in recent weeks has been fueled by those rumors.
