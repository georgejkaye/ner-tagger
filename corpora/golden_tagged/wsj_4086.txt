In a week that could chart a new course for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s TV and film industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> industry ministers are expected to approve by a narrow margin a measure to create a single market in TV broadcasting.
The measure, known as ``Television Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontiers</ENAMEX>,'' will be discussed by foreign ministers meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX> tomorrow.
The plan, which seeks to remove most barriers to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intra-Community</ENAMEX> broadcasting and trade by the end of 1992, has proved highly controversial because of its non-binding recommendation that a majority of entertainment broadcasts be of European origin. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> entertainment industry has lobbied strongly against that provision and has threatened to charge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> with unfair trading practices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> is expected to lobby to win support for a binding quota. But a majority of countries are expected to stick with the less stringent formulation, that a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> material should be used ``when practicable.''
The ``Television Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontiers</ENAMEX>'' directive was a central topic of discussion at a weekend conference here among top European media professionals trying to chart a new course for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s audiovisual industry.
Worried that U.S.-made TV shows and movies will dominate European airwaves even more after 1992, the experts called for urgent new measures to help make the European TV and film industry more competitive on world markets. Organizers hope that a summary of discussions, to be made today, will lead to a consensus on actions to take.
