<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Savings Bank</ENAMEX> said a default on $2 million of notes in its investment portfolio that were issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> could negatively affect earnings for the year ended July 31.
The thrift said it purchased the floating-rate notes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor's Corp.</ENAMEX> had downgraded the creditworthiness of the securities in June. The thrift said it didn't learn about the downgrading until later.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas</ENAMEX> defaulted on the notes Sept. 1 and earlier this week filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law. The notes are now trading at a substantial discount.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Savings</ENAMEX> still hasn't reported results for the year ended July 31. For the prior year, the thrift reported net income of $1.1 million, or 81 cents a share.
The thrift said it can't predict whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas</ENAMEX> will be able to restructure its debt. In the meantime, the thrift said it intends to pursue vigorously its claims against the securities firm that sold it the notes.
In over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Savings</ENAMEX> shares closed at $1.50, down 37.5 cents.
