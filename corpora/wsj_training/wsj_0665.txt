Employees of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe and Mail</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Corp.</ENAMEX> newspaper in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>, voted to accept a tentative contract agreement Saturday, averting a strike at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s leading daily.
Under the terms of the three-year contract, similar to one reached at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Torstar Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> Star newspaper earlier this month, the 500 Globe and Mail workers will see a raise of 8% in the contract's first year and 7% in each of the following two years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorne Slotnick</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the Southern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Newspaper Guild</ENAMEX>, the union representing the workers, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomson</ENAMEX> made significant concessions in the final round of talks. In addition to wage increases, the union negotiated improved vacation plans, benefit packages and pension plans, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slotnick</ENAMEX> said.
He said more than 70% of the bargaining unit voted in favor of the agreement.
