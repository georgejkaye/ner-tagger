Monday's provincial election results have revived the debate over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>'s place in -- or out of -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
``Everybody presumed independence as an issue was an historical artifact. I don't think you can say that anymore,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Forget</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> cabinet minister in the early 1970s and now a vice president of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> financial-services concern.
Premier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bourassa</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberal Party</ENAMEX> were returned to office with an overwhelming majority in Monday's election, taking 92 of the 125 seats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Assembly</ENAMEX>.
The revitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX> took only 29 seats. But it grabbed 40% of the popular vote, the same share of the vote it garnered in a 1980 referendum on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> independence. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX> put <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> independence front and center on its platform this year after dropping it in the 1985 election. The results of Monday's vote are a victory of sorts for party leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Parizeau</ENAMEX>, 59 years old, a rotund professor and former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> finance minister.
A year ago, many observers predicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX> was near death and would be replaced by a new nationalist, but not separatist, opposition party. Instead, Monday's election results put the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX> back in business.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> will also come under attack from another direction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equality Party</ENAMEX>, a new group that ran candidates in English-speaking districts, traditionally Liberal Party strongholds, won four seats. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equality Party</ENAMEX> was created to protest Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>'s decision last year to ban English on exterior commercial signs. But the unexpected success of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equality Party</ENAMEX> frees Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> to take a harder -- not softer -- nationalist line.
``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> has proved he can win without English-speakers,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard St-Laurent</ENAMEX>, a political columnist with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal Daily News</ENAMEX>. ``The natural pressure on the Liberals will be to move closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX>.''
Meanwhile, the unraveling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Meech Lake</ENAMEX> constitutional accord, which would recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> as a ``distinct society'' within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, could give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> another push toward some form of independence. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> calls the accord ``the absolute minimum'' Quebec requires to remain in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. If the accord doesn't go through, as now seems likely, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> will be forced to come up with an alternative plan.
``The country is in big trouble,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St-Laurent</ENAMEX> said.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Meech Lake</ENAMEX> is a test,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soucy D. Gagne</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorecom Inc.</ENAMEX>, a public-opinion polling concern. ``A majority of Quebeckers are federalists but not unconditionally,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gagne</ENAMEX> said, echoing almost word-for-word Premier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>'s victory speech Monday night.
The revived debate over independence will be different in at least one significant way from the battle in the 1970s. Then, fears about the impact of independence on the economy were a dominant theme. Now, after six years of robust economic growth, those fears don't exist.
``Everything seems possible in a climate of (economic) confidence,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forget</ENAMEX> said. ``People are more willing to take a bold step they might have judged as too risky in other times.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forget</ENAMEX> notes that the debate is just beginning. ``I believe there will be a resurgence of the soul-searching -- on both sides -- about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>'s place in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> we saw in the past,'' he said. ``We're starting to talk about (independence) again but only hypothetically.
