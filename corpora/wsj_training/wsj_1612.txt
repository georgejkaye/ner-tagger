<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banc One Corp.</ENAMEX> said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trustcorp Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toledo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, following the planned merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trustcorp</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>.
The five offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Erie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottawa</ENAMEX> counties in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Ohio</ENAMEX> have total assets of about $88 million, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banc One</ENAMEX> said. The purchase price will be established after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banc One</ENAMEX> has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banc One</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society Corp.</ENAMEX> already has branches in the area, and selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trustcorp</ENAMEX> offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society, according to industry sources. The merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter.
