Bond prices and the dollar took a header in nervous trading while stock prices ended lower after waffling through most of the day.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average lost 3.42 points to close at 2683.89 in another day of anemic trading. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Transportation Average</ENAMEX> rose again on the strength of continuing speculation in airline stocks.
Worried currency traders, fearing stepped-up intervention after this coming weekend's meeting of central bankers and finance ministers, bid the dollar lower. Long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds sank in the wake of the weakening dollar.
Currency traders said that besides a wariness of central bank action against the dollar, there also is a fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> will boost interest rates today. Although the likelihood of such an increase isn't great, traders don't want to be holding dollars should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> decide today that inflationary threats justify an interest rate increase.
Bond traders, focusing on the dollar's weakness yesterday, failed to respond favorably to encouraging news on the inflation front. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>'s official summary of economic conditions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s 12 districts showed price pressures are moderating as the economy grows modestly.
Stock market action was muted. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argus Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> recommended yesterday that investors further reduce their exposure to stocks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.C. Moore</ENAMEX>, director of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argus</ENAMEX>, said the firm continues to foresee a recession beginning before the end of the year.
In major market activity:
Stock prices slipped in thin trading. Volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> totaled 136.6 million shares. Declining issues on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> were ahead of advancers, 726-697.
Bond prices fell. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s benchmark 30-year bond lost nearly seven-eighths of a point, or close to $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount.
The dollar weakened against most major currencies. In late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading the dollar was quoted at 1.9395 marks and 145.13 yen, compared with 1.9545 marks and 145.85 yen Tuesday.
