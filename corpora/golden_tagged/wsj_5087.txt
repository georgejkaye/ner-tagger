Western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s largest satellite-launching company doesn't regard <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s attempt to develop its own launch capacity as a threat, its chairman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic d'Allest</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace Co.</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s efforts could benefit his company.
``It isn't our intention to tell <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> not to build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-2'' satellite-launch rocket, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d'Allest</ENAMEX> said. ``Our stance is that we have a joint partnership. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s perfecting its own technology will lead to our mutual benefit.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is developing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-2, its next generation satellite-launch rocket, which could become a direct competitor with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>'s own satellite launchers.
Until recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> has relied primarily on foreign satellite technology. With no large military to provide abundant orders for launch rockets, it was a latecomer to their development.
But Japanese officials have begun to argue that it is important for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> to develop its own launch capacity. The nation has boosted its spending on space development, including research on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-2.
This has led to some fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> will become the same kind of competitor in satellites that it has in steel, automobiles and home electronics.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d'Allest</ENAMEX> said, ``We aren't concerned whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-2 contains the world's most advanced technology. Our concern is whether we can provide lifting services for the cheapest amount of money.
``The future will tell whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-2 or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>'s next-generation rocket} will be the cheaper technology,'' he added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> officials said they hope that if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>-2 is a success, Japanese satellites still will be made compatible for liftoff on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> rockets as well. This would enable the satellite owner to reduce risk in case of a mishap, they said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, a closely held company registered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, represents 10 European countries. Since its founding in 1980, it has garnered more than 50% of the world market for commercial-satellite-launching rockets.
