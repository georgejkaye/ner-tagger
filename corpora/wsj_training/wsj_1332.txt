<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westamerica Bancorp.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard W. Decker</ENAMEX> resigned as president and chief executive officer after only a year on the job because of ``differences'' with the board.
The banking company couldn't be reached to comment beyond a written announcement. It didn't specify the nature of the differences, saying only that they related to ``management style'' and ``strategic objectives.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westamerica</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX>'s posts were assumed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Payne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westamerica</ENAMEX>'s chairman, who at 34 years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX> is about 45 years old.
Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payne</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX> could be reached to comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westamerica</ENAMEX> has about $1.3 billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern California</ENAMEX>. It controls about 35% of the affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marin County</ENAMEX> market across the Golden Gate bridge from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX>'s resignation surprised many industry officials. He was brought to the company in September 1988 after 15 years at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Interstate Bancorp</ENAMEX>. The bank had been suffering in late 1987 from a slew of bad real estate loans made in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>. When he was hired, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payne</ENAMEX> lauded Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX>'s ``extraordinary... skills'' and his ``outstanding reputation as one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>'s brightest bankers.''
Though the bank isn't performing as well as some of its competitors in the lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> market, its condition has improved since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX> took over. For the six months ended June 30, it earned $3.1 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with net income of $2.4 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.
Its stock also has risen lately, at least partly because it is considered a possible takeover candidate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interstate banking</ENAMEX> is scheduled to begin in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> in 1991, and larger <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> banks, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo & Co.</ENAMEX>, have been paying fat premiums to buy smaller banks to control markets before any out-of-state banks enter the fray.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westamerica</ENAMEX> closed at $22.25 a share, down 75 cents.
