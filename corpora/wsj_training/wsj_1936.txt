This seems to be the season for revivals in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubs</ENAMEX>' championship season ended with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National League</ENAMEX> playoffs, a revival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organic Theater</ENAMEX>'s production of ``Bleacher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bums</ENAMEX>,'' a play in nine innings set in the Wrigley Field bleachers, continues within spitting distance of the ballpark.
Revivals of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater troupes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX>. Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship, but both help explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> remains a vital center of this country's regional theater movement.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX> is offering a modernized version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moliere</ENAMEX>'s ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Misanthrope</ENAMEX>'' through Nov. 4. The original is a comedy about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alceste</ENAMEX>, a man who sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself. He is the jealous friend of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philinte</ENAMEX>, and the jealous lover of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Celimene</ENAMEX>. The play is filled with intrigue, dishonesty and injustice.
Twenty-five years ago the poet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Wilbur</ENAMEX> modernized this 17th-century comedy merely by avoiding ``the zounds sort of thing,'' as he wrote in his introduction. Otherwise, the scene remained Celimene's house in 1666. Assuming modern audiences readily understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moliere</ENAMEX>'s social indictment covers their world as well as 17th-century <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX> concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX> translation is remarkable -- well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity.
But if you happen to be coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> in the next few weeks, don't fail to have a look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Falls</ENAMEX>'s ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Misanthrope</ENAMEX>'' at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman.</ENAMEX> If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX>'s translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th-century <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX>'s production is a mirror in which we see ourselves.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman</ENAMEX>'s artistic director, took a recent adaptation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Bartlett</ENAMEX> and significantly adapted it. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> had slimmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moliere</ENAMEX>'s cast of characters to six and set them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> media world of Thatcherite <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> transfers the setting to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there -- agents, producers, actors, writers and sycophants.
It works. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> managed to more or less maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moliere</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexandrine</ENAMEX> verse form, 12 syllable lines in rhyming couplets. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> kept the form, but Americanized it with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX>'s further help. With a splendid cast led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Darlow</ENAMEX> as Alceste, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christina Haag</ENAMEX> as Celimene and, especially, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brown</ENAMEX> as a Philinte who plays the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> game but harbors authentic values and feelings, the Goodman production barrels through an all-night Hollywood party with exuberance and wit. If this version, with its references to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Spielberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spago</ENAMEX> and ``thirtysomething'' attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version, then <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bartlett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX> are justified in abandoning Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX>.
A 300-year-old play may be easier to revive than one merely 25. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steppenwolf Theatre Company</ENAMEX>, back from a critical and box office success in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> with its adaptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steinbeck</ENAMEX>'s ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' opened the new season with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Pinter</ENAMEX>'s ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homecoming</ENAMEX>,'' first produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Shakespeare Company</ENAMEX> in 1965.
Back then, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinter</ENAMEX> was not only the angry young British playwright, but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares, almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue. When ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homecoming</ENAMEX>'' was first produced on this side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, actors and directors were reverential. Silences were lengthy -- nobody moved or gestured. Nobody smiled onstage, and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh. This kind of theater was new to us. Also, it was not a funny time over here, what with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> War, the'68'68 Democratic convention, assassinations and riots.
But under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Perry</ENAMEX>'s direction the current Steppenwolf production, scheduled to play through Nov. 19, breaks through the flat and boring ritual that ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homecoming</ENAMEX>'' had become. Led by a near-perfect performance by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Wilder</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>, the father, the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family's rage, bitterness, fear and isolation. Encouraged by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilder</ENAMEX>'s sly grins, embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages, the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act.
Three of the family members, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> and his two sons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey</ENAMEX>, live off the flesh: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX> is a retired butcher, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lenny</ENAMEX> a pimp and Joey an aspiring boxer. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>'s brother, has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife. Teddy, the eldest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>'s sons, has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an American university.
Though it's clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>'s wife who held sway here until her death, now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max</ENAMEX>. The play concerns Teddy's homecoming with his wife of six years, Ruth. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curiously</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall Arney</ENAMEX> as Teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the zombie approach to a Pinter character. As Ruth, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moira Harris</ENAMEX>, a large and beautiful woman who may be our next Colleen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dewhurst</ENAMEX>, begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men. In the end, Teddy returns alone to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, leaving Ruth in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Max</ENAMEX>'s chair. We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in-law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother, and then some.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> with ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Sagan</ENAMEX>, the president of its board of directors, quietly returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> to buy a piece of real estate in the city's rapidly reviving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Halsted Street</ENAMEX> restaurant and theater district. Within a year he hopes Steppenwolf will move into a new 500-seat theater on that site. The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one-set production. ``If we wanted to stage `Death of a Salesman,' ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> says, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Loman</ENAMEX> would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling.''
Steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space. It's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13,000 who can be accommodated in its present digs. For all the attention that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> theater has received during the past decade, not one new building has been devoted to it. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX>, a former publisher and real estate developer, has put together an $8 million financial package that includes approximately $4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of Illinois</ENAMEX> (the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater), and approximately $1 million in grants from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Endowment</ENAMEX> for the Arts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macarthur Foundation</ENAMEX>, and a few other deep pockets. The rest, he is confident, can be raised. His board members alone have pledged $800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> compares the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orson Welles</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercury Theater</ENAMEX> in the'30s. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welles</ENAMEX>'s theater company turned out to have a brief -- one might say a mercurial -- existence. What will Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> do with his new theater building if the allure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> proves too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malkovich</ENAMEX> (``Dangerous Liaisons''), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Allen</ENAMEX> (``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heidi Chronicles'')</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenne Headly</ENAMEX> (``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lonesome Dove</ENAMEX>''), and the company crumbles? ``That's OK,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sagan</ENAMEX> replies. ``Let this building be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steppenwolf</ENAMEX>'s legacy to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> theater.''
