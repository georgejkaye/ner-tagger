ROUGH AND TUMBLE magazine selling gets tougher and more expensive.
Magazines generate about $3 billion a year at 200,000 supermarkets and newsstands, but space is at a premium. About 30 titles dominate single-copy sales, all from major publishers. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauer Publishing</ENAMEX> manages to make a splash anyway with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First for Women magazine</ENAMEX>, selling about four million copies a month after less than a year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bauer</ENAMEX> pays retailers $27 for each checkout-stand display position, plus a $9 quarterly ``pocket'' fee. Most competitors pay around $5. Another wrinkle: offer the first issue for 25 cents and let the retailer keep it. The push generates prominent newsstand spots.
Other publishers are wary of such spending but take note anyway. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s magazine unit will launch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soap Opera</ENAMEX> Weekly this fall using some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bauer</ENAMEX>'s tricks, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Elm</ENAMEX>, vice president of single-copy sales. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> will pay $10 for checkout position, and a $5 quarterly fee, high compared with the $3.25 the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Enquirer</ENAMEX> pays.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> launched fashion magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mirabella</ENAMEX>, normally $3, at $1 a copy and sold out the issue's 600,000 run.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CHINA</ENAMEX> TOURISM poses moral, practical choices for the travel industry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s crackdown turns off American tourists, but agents debate whether boycotts and such are appropriate or effective. ``We aren't supposed to be commentators on politics,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Kaplan</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Society of Travel</ENAMEX> Agents' consumer affairs committee. Others see too much equivocating. ``We shouldn't be providing hard currency'' to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> in light of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen</ENAMEX> massacre, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Mcdonald</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belmont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, booker of cruises.
Tourist travel is virtually written off for 1989. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> says U.S. tourists spent nearly $500 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> travel (excluding airfare) in 1988. But tour prices are being discounted as much as 33%. To recover, some joint promotional efforts with the Chinese government are planned. ``We came to the conclusion that we can't wait for miracles {in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>}, or else we'll lose 1990,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris Schuster</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Tourism Action Committee</ENAMEX> of tour operators, airlines and hotels.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIOTECHNOLOGY</ENAMEX> PRODUCT sales continue to soar, but capital remains elusive.
The average revenue of biotech firms rose 33% to $8.2 million in 1988 from 1987, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst & Young</ENAMEX> survey indicates. Almost two-thirds of all revenue came from new products such as clot dissolving TPA, synthetic antibodies and interferon, for cancer. Product sales are ``a sharp contrast to the days when biotechnology companies lived off meager contract research and interest income,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Burrill</ENAMEX>.
Still, only a handful of biotech companies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor Corp.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genentech Inc.</ENAMEX>, are profitable. Others will need large infusions of capital -- an average of $55 million each the next decade -- to become significant players. With the stock market cautious, biotech firms will turn to corporate partners, the study says.
Most will remain small, ``research boutiques,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Weisbord</ENAMEX>.
WHEN IN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ROME</ENAMEX>? The most important foreign language for a successful business career in the next 20 years is Spanish, say 44% of executives polled by temporary-help firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accountemps</ENAMEX>. Japanese followed at 33%. Others trailed: French, 8%; Chinese, 6%; German, 5%; and Russian, 1%.
ALL THE NEWS that fits the stall. Some cows bed down on shredded newspapers, thanks to the drought-inspired brainstorm of two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri dairymen</ENAMEX>. The paper costs about half as much as hay.
DIAL-A-PIANO-LESSON: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duane Shinn</ENAMEX> offers weekly taped tutelage free to callers as a promotion for his $19.95 instructional tapes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Medford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore.</ENAMEX>, pianist also provides free lesson transcripts.
EXPENSIVE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EYEWEAR</ENAMEX>: The industry pushes spectacular spectacles.
With unit sales flat in the $9 billion market, eyeglasses makers turn to fashion to boost profits. Consumers are more willing to buy multiple pairs of glasses, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Karp</ENAMEX>, associate editor for trade book Vision Monday. ``It's become the latest accessory, like a scarf or belt,'' adds Whitey <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petersen</ENAMEX>, a vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optique Du Monde Ltd.</ENAMEX>, distributor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nicklaus</ENAMEX> eyewear. ``A woman may own 15 to 20 pairs of glasses to match different outfits.'' Some are selling spectacles to shoppers who don't need them but want a certain look.
This week's industry trade show featured plastic sunglasses with pulsating disco lights from Sport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optics International</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> ($10), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartier Inc.</ENAMEX>'s platinum, gold, onyx and diamond frames ($82,000). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europa Eyewear Corp.</ENAMEX> sells 22-karat gold frames for around $250, ``good for clinching that Wall Street deal.'' Customers want ``different glasses for boating than for skiing,'' says a marketer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allegra Inc.</ENAMEX>'s Ziari line of sunglasses.
Glasses makers figure the market will soar as baby boomers reach their 40s and face the inevitable: bifocals.
BRIEFS: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Architects</ENAMEX> sends teams to areas hit by Hurricane Hugo to make damage assessments, offer salvage and demolition advice.... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingersoll Publications Co.</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Sun</ENAMEX> newspaper calls its vending boxes ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Facts Machines.</ENAMEX>''... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Trust & Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> donates $1.5 million to establish a professorship of Japanese financial markets and economy at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Business School</ENAMEX>.
