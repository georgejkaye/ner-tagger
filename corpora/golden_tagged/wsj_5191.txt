The monetary officials who begin gathering here today represent the world's leading economic powers. But in their battle to control the dollar, they look increasingly impotent.
For months, a buoyant dollar has defied efforts by the seven leading industrial nations to keep it within the ranges secretly agreed to in December 1987. And in recent days, the dollar has taken a wild rollercoaster ride, impervious to government desires.
As a result, international efforts to stabilize exchange rates now face a credibility crisis -- and U.S. manufacturers may find the export boom stopping dead in its tracks. ``The process is in a shambles,'' charges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Bergsten</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for International Economics</ENAMEX>.
Finance ministers and central bankers from the so-called Group of Seven nations will search for a solution to that crisis tomorrow, when they meet before the start of the annual meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>.
Their chances of success aren't high. Both the Bush administration and the Japanese would like to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> lower interest rates -- a move that would weaken the dollar by making U.S. investments less attractive. According to some U.S. officials, the Japanese have offered to multiply the power of a U.S. interest-rate cut by boosting their own interest rates at the same time.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> is unlikely to comply. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chief is far less concerned than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> about perceptions that the governments have lost control over the dollar. And any such move would also be strongly opposed by several of the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> presidents who sit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> policy board. ``I don't think the dollar in itself should be an issue,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> Fed President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Parry</ENAMEX> said in an interview this week.
In the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> action, any internationally coordinated effort to bring down the dollar may have little effect. Rate boosts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> could ease pressure on the dollar somewhat. And the central banks will continue to attempt to drive down the greenback by selling dollars in exchange markets. But the effects of such intervention are limited.
``International capital markets have grown so big that the central banks don't have very strong or direct control of the process,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Johnson</ENAMEX>, vice president, global markets, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX>
At stake in the battle to control the dollar is the health of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy. Most economists believe the drop in the dollar partly engineered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> between 1985 and 1987 fueled the boom in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> factory exports. A lower dollar boosts exports by making them less expensive overseas.
In recent months, however, the dollar has rebounded, rising more than 10% against other major currencies. Unless it comes down from those heights, many analysts believe the stubbornly huge U.S. trade gap will start growing again. ``The dollar is already starting to put a crimp in exports,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Aho</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council on Foreign Relations</ENAMEX>, ``and if it hangs up there, we are going to have a very difficult time closing the trade gap.''
The dollar's persistent strength is starting to cause worries among U.S. businessmen, and it's raising eyebrows in Congress as well. ``By far the biggest disappointment is the rise in the value of the dollar since the beginning of the year,'' says Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Pease</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>), a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX>.
Some critics lay the blame for the problem at the feet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX>. His predecessor, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, was a master at using a combination of public statements and central-bank intervention to bully exchange markets and create at least the impression that he had them under control. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX>, however, seldom mentions the dollar in public. As a result, he has shown little ability to influence the market's course.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> is one of the premier cabinet-level policy operators of recent U.S. government,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.M. Destler</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Maryland</ENAMEX> professor who has co-authored a new book on dollar politics. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> certainly hasn't established that sort of reputation so far.'' New finance ministers and political turmoil in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> also have hampered efforts to coordinate policies.
Moreover, world economic conditions have changed considerably since 1985, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and his fellow ministers launched their new policy in a famous meeting at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza Hotel</ENAMEX>. With ample slack in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Volcker</ENAMEX> had room to back Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s efforts with an easier monetary policy. At the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> could boost demand in their economies with little fear of inflation. Now, with inflation fears in all three countries, ``there's much less room to maneuver,'' says one U.S. official.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central-bank</ENAMEX> intervention in exchange markets may also be losing some of its punch. A recent study from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</ENAMEX> found that total foreign-exchange trading volume in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is now $128.9 billion per day -- more than double the level of three years ago. With such huge sums of money surging through the market, even the record $12 billion spent by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> in May, June and July to blunt the dollar's rise seems like spitting into a supertanker.
Despite the problems, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> officials defend the G-7 coordination process, which includes finance ministers and central bankers from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>. ``I think the G-7 process itself remains highly credible,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Undersecretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mulford</ENAMEX> told an economics conference here last week. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX> argues that stabilizing the dollar is only a subsidiary goal of the international policy-coordination effort. Much more important is maintaining healthy growth in the world economy -- and on that score, he argues, the policy has succeeded.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hale</ENAMEX>, chief economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX>, also says recent efforts to hold down the dollar may have been more successful than they seem. ``Intervention has had some effect. If we hadn't had the intervention we had, the dollar would have already gone to 160 yen to the dollar,'' he says. Instead, it has stayed between 140 yen and 150 yen.
