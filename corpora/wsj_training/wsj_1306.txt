<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX> said it won't join <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Memories</ENAMEX>, the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy</ENAMEX>'s decision is a second setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories.</ENAMEX> Last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> said that it wouldn't invest in the group. Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips, a market dominated by the Japanese. Those chips were in dire shortage last year, hurting many U.S. computer companies that couldn't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> said its experience during the shortage didn't merit the $5 million to $50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor. ``At this time, we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need {for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Drams</ENAMEX>} from the market as a rule,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Juge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy</ENAMEX>'s director of market planning.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Kane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Memories president, said the decision was ``disappointing,'' but doesn't presage U.S. Memories' failure. ``I would like to have had them,'' he said. But ``they weren't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> became president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> last June, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> was formed by seven electronics companies: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSI Logic Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan, probably late this week. U.S. Memories needs a catalyst, he said, to inspire others to join.
But so far, most potential participants haven't decided. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> said it's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> representatives later this week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> said it was waiting to see U.S. Memories' business plan. Personal-computer maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST Research Inc.</ENAMEX> said it is still studying the situation.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said that the company hasn't made a decision yet, although ``it isn't under active consideration.
