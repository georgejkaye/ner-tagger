The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering Corp.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering-Plough Corp.</ENAMEX>, with making false and deceptive claims about a weight-control pill.
The commission said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schering</ENAMEX> doesn't have sufficient evidence to back up its claim that the product, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fibre Trim</ENAMEX>, is an effective appetite suppressant. It also said the company falsely advertised the pill as a high-fiber dietary supplement.
The company has 30 days to respond to the charges, and may contest them during a formal administrative hearing. The commissioners voted 4-0 to issue the complaint. Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Steiger</ENAMEX> didn't participate.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering-Plough</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, pharmaceutical company, said it will ``vigorously'' defend itself against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX> charges, and plans to continue selling the product. He said internal studies have shown that fiber, along with proper diet and exercise, can be used to help people lose weight. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fibre Trim</ENAMEX> is sold in three forms, a tablet, a calcium-supplemented tablet and a fruit-flavored tablet that dissolves in water.
