About two dozen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> employees are leaving the firm after approval of a bylaws change that will soon discourage defections by workers holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> stock.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> spokesman said shareholders at the closely held firm approved the bylaws change -- which makes employee shareholders wait significantly longer to cash in their  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> shares than they used to -- at a special meeting. He confirmed that about two dozen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s employees will be leaving before the bylaws change takes effect, but declined to comment further.
It appears that few key employees are jumping ship, however. The best-known of the departing employees is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Healy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s oft-quoted auto industry analyst, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> officials said.
Under the bylaws change, shareholders who leave the firm will have to wait significantly longer to get paid for all of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> holdings than they used to -- about 5.5 years on average under the new plan, compared with 1.4 years previously. The company says the change puts the firm on equal footing with other closely held securities firms.
About 1,000 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s 5,500 employees have purchased and own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> shares; others own shares through the firm's employee-bonus plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> considers the payout-bylaws change as the final piece in a year of internal restructuring spurred by its settlement in an insider-trading scandal.
