<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates International Inc.</ENAMEX> reported earnings for the second quarter, ended Sept. 30, plummeted 66%, primarily because of the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet Software Inc.</ENAMEX>
The nation's largest software company earned $9.6 million, or five cents a share, compared with $28 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $282 million from $268.3 million.
The drop in earnings had been anticipated by most Wall Street analysts, but the results were reported after the market closed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> closed at $13.625, down 25 cents, in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Wang</ENAMEX>, president, attributed the drop to the disruption of the company's business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX>. The acquisition was completed in September.
In August, the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed, and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed. The delays mainly affected sales of data base management products, a core area for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cullinet</ENAMEX>, as well as sales of other products as part of package sales.
