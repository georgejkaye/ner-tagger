``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' may be visiting some new venues in the near future. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> (``Maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob'') Potter</ENAMEX> sentenced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Bakker</ENAMEX> to 45 years in the big house yesterday, while a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> judge tucked away Zsa <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsa Gabor</ENAMEX> for three days, plus 120 hours of work with homeless women. Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabor</ENAMEX> recanted her earlier-expressed fear of jailhouse lesbians. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bakker</ENAMEX> said he was guilty of sin but not fraud. We can only wonder who will be the next lost soul chosen to be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celebrity Convict</ENAMEX>.
