<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX>'s biggest creditors, is believed to have reduced its exposure to the embattled Australian entrepreneur 20% to 25% this year and is expected to lower its exposure further.
Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> will say how much it has lent him. Analysts estimate the current sum at between $750 million and $800 million, off from between $1 billion and $1.1 billion at the beginning of the year. Despite the decline, they believe about 16% of the bank's published shareholder funds are committed to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>.
A drop in the bank's exposure to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> was expected. Last December, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Selway-Swift</ENAMEX>, the bank's general manager in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, said the total would fall 25% by August. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Thompson</ENAMEX>, an economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Natwest Securities Asia Ltd.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Westminster Bank PLC</ENAMEX>, says he believes it will fall by that much ``this year.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers</ENAMEX> said the reduction has been accomplished through a fixed-repayment schedule for much of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s short-term debt with the bank. They said the recent sale of assets by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> may have gone to pay off additional debt, though they saw no signs the bank was trying to distance itself from him.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> was one of the first financial institutions to back Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> as he was building his brewing, media, resources and property empire. If his problems continue to worsen, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX>'s share price might be affected, analysts say. For now, however, rumors the bank is considering moving its headquarters overseas before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 are helping to buoy the price.
That speculation, which hasn't drawn a comment from the bank, has pushed up the price 8% in the past month and may continue to offset any bad news about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>, the analysts said. The bank's stock closed at HK$6.15 (79 U.S. cents) a share yesterday.
The financial situation of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s 58%-controlled flagship, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX>, has deteriorated sharply in recent months as bankers have tightened credit lines and investors have dumped the stock, which has fallen 80% this year. It closed yesterday at 36 Australian cents (29 U.S. cents) in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>.
The turning point in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s corporate fortunes was his foray against the British conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonrho PLC</ENAMEX> about a year ago. He built a 20.4% stake in the company that appeared to presage a takeover offer, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonrho</ENAMEX>, which is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.W.</ENAMEX> ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiny'' Rowland</ENAMEX>, counterattacked with a campaign that centered on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s debt. The campaign was effective in making creditors uneasy.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> won't disclose the size of the group's debt, analysts estimate the current total at six billion Australian dollars (US$4.65 billion). Since April, signs have emerged that the group is facing a cash bind, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> said earlier this month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> has ``a number of problems we're dealing with.''
To raise cash, the company has been selling assets. Last week, it announced it had sold its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonrho</ENAMEX> stake at a loss of # 50 million (US$79.1 million). Earlier this week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Perth</ENAMEX>-based concern announced a complex proposal aimed at selling half of its most valuable asset, its Australian brewing empire.
Analysts applauded the planned sale as a way to help keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> afloat, but investors appear skeptical the transaction will be completed. Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> have sagged on the news, as have those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an associated company that would become 100%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> as part of the proposed brewing-assets transaction.
It was a very different story a few years ago, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> was riding high as one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s most successful and most well-known businessmen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> was eager to be a part of his success; it helped Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> get into the brewing business in 1982 by bankrolling the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Perth</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swan Brewery Co.</ENAMEX> Since then, the bank has remained a big backer of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s ventures.
