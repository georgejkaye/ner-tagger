<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great American Bank</ENAMEX> said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law.
The proposed holding company's primary purpose would be to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great American</ENAMEX> to continue engaging in real estate development activities, it said. Those activities generated $26.1 million in operating profit last year.
But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great American</ENAMEX>, such profits don't count toward meeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> savings bank's new capitalization requirements under 1989 federal law. The new real estate unit would have a separate capital structure to comply with the law.
The proposed holding company would also consolidate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great American Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tucson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, savings bank into a single, federally chartered institution in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>. The consolidation is expected to save $1 million a year in administrative costs, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great American</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
