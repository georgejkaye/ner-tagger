With the successful opening of two shows in a row, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweeney Todd</ENAMEX>'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orpheus Descending</ENAMEX>,'' the fall theater season has done a 180-degree turn from a year ago. Then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broadway</ENAMEX> was a disaster area, a sort of Beirut-on-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson</ENAMEX>. The construction of new office buildings in the theater district, accelerated to take advantage of special inducements made to real estate developers, had torn the area asunder. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway Theater</ENAMEX>, where ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Miserables</ENAMEX>'' is playing, had to cancel Wednesday matinees because of construction noise next door. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritz Theater</ENAMEX> (soon to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Kerr Theater</ENAMEX>) had so much disruption on all sides of it that it lost out on several hits it might have landed.
Even worse than the devastation outside the theaters was what was happening inside them. In the four months of September through December last season only six shows opened. Of the six, only one was a musical and that was the disastrous ``Legs Diamond.'' Without question, it was the worst fall season in memory. The situation was so grim that after ``Legs'' closed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nederlander Organization</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Hellinger Theater</ENAMEX>, in which it had played, out of circulation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hellinger</ENAMEX>, one of the finest musical houses in the city and home of such legendary hits as ``My Fair Lady,'' was leased full-time for five years to a church organization.
This year there appears to be a complete rebound. Construction still abounds, but several buildings are nearing completion and inside the theaters there will be a veritable cornucopia of shows with nearly three times as many openings scheduled as last fall. Among the musicals are ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Hotel</ENAMEX>,'' based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vicki Baum</ENAMEX> novel and directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Tune</ENAMEX>; ``Meet Me in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>,'' based on the movie musical; ``Dangerous Games,'' two one-act dance dramas created by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graciela Daniele</ENAMEX>; ``City of Angels'' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cy Coleman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gelbart</ENAMEX>; and ``Prince of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Park</ENAMEX>,'' based on a 1975 novel. Also in the musical column are revivals of ``Gypsy'' featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyne Daly</ENAMEX> and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Threepenny Opera</ENAMEX>'' starring the rock star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sting</ENAMEX>.
In addition to his musical Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> will be weighing in with a political satire called ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastergate</ENAMEX>,'' based on, guess what? The other straight plays include ``A Few Good Men,'' about the trial of two Marines for the murder of a third, by a new playwright, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aaron Sorkin</ENAMEX>; ``Artist Descending a Staircase'' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Stoppard</ENAMEX>; ``Secret Rapture'' by another well-established British dramatist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hare</ENAMEX>; and Paddy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chayefsky</ENAMEX>'s ``The Tenth Man,'' which will be revived by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Center</ENAMEX>.
The stars will be out too. Along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sting</ENAMEX> is Vanessa Redgrave in ``Orpheus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descending.</ENAMEX>'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dustin Hoffman</ENAMEX> will appear in ``The Merchant of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venice</ENAMEX>,'' and three well-known performers -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rex Harrison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glynis Johns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart Granger</ENAMEX> -- will be in a revival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somerset Maugham</ENAMEX>'s ``The Circle.''
``Orpheus Descending'' and ``The Merchant of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venice</ENAMEX>'' have more than their stars to recommend them. They mark the first ventures of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Hall</ENAMEX> in the commercial arena. For 30 years Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> has been the quintessential not-for-profit theater man. In 1960 he founded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Shakespeare Company</ENAMEX>, which he headed until 1968, and in 1973 took over the leadership of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Theatre</ENAMEX>, now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal National Theatre</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Olivier</ENAMEX>. It was Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> who brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> to renown in its new home on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thames</ENAMEX>. Last year Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> announced that he was leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> to form a commercial venture, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter Hall Co.</ENAMEX>, to produce classical plays in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and elsewhere. His first two attempts have been ``Orpheus'' and ``Merchant,'' which, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> at least, have been enormously successful.
Does the flurry of activity on Broadway mean that the long drought is over, that the problems that have plagued the theater for the last decade have disappeared? Unfortunately, not in the least. Ironically the volume of productions this fall is partly the result of problems that remain endemic. One of these is the length of time it takes to move a production from the planning stage to an opening on Broadway, especially a musical. Many of the musicals arriving this season are revivals, not only because they are proven commodities but because it doesn't take the same length of time to assemble all the elements. Part of the explanation for the fall activity is that several productions that had been in the planning stage for several years, such as ``Meet Me in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>,'' are fortuitously ripe for Broadway at the same time.
The problems in mounting a musical, especially the financial problems, remain very much with us. A good example is ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Robbins' Broadway</ENAMEX>,'' the dance compendium that opened last season at a cost of more than $8 million. At capacity the show grosses $530,000 per week, but its expenses are around $420,000 a week. It doesn't take very sophisticated arithmetic to realize that it will be 75 or 80 weeks playing to full houses before the show pays back its initial capitalization, let alone makes a profit.
It is significant, too, that of the many offerings this fall only one, ``A Few Good Men,'' is a new play by an American playwright. Given this fact and the continuing high costs of all productions, both straight plays and musicals, the problems that have beset the theater are still very much with us. Some of them may appear intractable, but others are the result of pure stubbornness and lack of vision. For example, there are the smaller Broadway houses such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lyceum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belasco</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cort</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ritz</ENAMEX>. Officially designated by both unions and producers as ``endangered theaters,'' they are victims of an arbitrary division between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> and off-Broadway.
Even with certain union concessions, cost remain so much higher on Broadway than off that today's young, independent producers find it more profitable to produce straight plays in smaller off-Broadway houses. If everyone got together, however, to effect a compromise, the endangered Broadway houses could be filled with plays like ``Driving Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daisy</ENAMEX>'' and ``Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People's Money</ENAMEX>'' rather than standing empty. Several formulas have been suggested to solve this problem, but so far no driving force or catalytic agent has appeared to bring it about.
Even so, those who care about the theater can revel in this fall harvest. The theater, like the stock market, thrives on optimism; perhaps this burst of activity will become a self-fulfilling prophecy and producers who were ready to despair will sally forth despite the odds.
