``The Famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>,'' which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> had hoped would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule, isn't turning out to be the hit the network envisaged.
Although the half-hour situation comedy seen Mondays at 9:30 p.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> time isn't a candidate for cancellation, it is slated for fine-tuning and by next week the network may announce ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>'' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot, replacing ``The People Next Door,'' which became the first network show to be canceled this season.
``Teddy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Z</ENAMEX>,'' which centers on a mailroom clerk-turned agent at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> talent agency, was scheduled in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot to follow ``Murphy Brown,'' a situation comedy about a television news magazine, starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candice Bergen</ENAMEX>. ``Teddy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Z</ENAMEX>'' was boosted by favorable reviews and a network-wide promotional tie-in contest with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart Corp.</ENAMEX> It was promoted on cable services, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX>, Nick at Night and VH-1, and premiered as the No. 22-rated show for the week.
But five weeks after the premiere, the series has floundered. In figures released yesterday by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.C. Nielsen Co.</ENAMEX> ``Teddy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Z</ENAMEX>,'' produced by the television unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, was in 37th place. Worse, every week it suffers audience drop-off from ``Murphy Brown'' and viewership on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> picks up again once ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>'' is over and is followed by ``Designing Women.''
``There is strong indication that `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>' is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sisk</ENAMEX>, senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Walter Thompson Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group PLC</ENAMEX>.
Last week, ``Murphy Brown'' was viewed by 14.1% of the available television households, while the number dropped to 12.6% for ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>'' and rose to 14.2% for ``Designing Women.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> executives said the program is also slated to undergo some plot changes. Creator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Wilson</ENAMEX>, for example, included the lead character's Greek family in the cast, ``but that is not the right focus anymore,'' said one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> executive. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent.
``We're making adjustments on the show, yes, but nothing radical,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Nelson</ENAMEX>, the story consultant on ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z.</ENAMEX>'' ``But we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family.'' The opening credits are being redone, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson</ENAMEX> said, ``to make Teddy's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning. Those viewers find the show confusing.
