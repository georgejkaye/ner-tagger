After two weeks of tough internal bargaining, members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ENAMEX> have introduced a far-reaching package of proposals designed to monitor and implement major reductions of conventional weapons and troops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
The proposals handed to representatives of the Warsaw Pact yesterday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> spell out, for the first time, limits on military exercises and stored military equipment as well as a system of military inspections that would allow each side to inspect the other's forces at any time, anywhere from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Urals</ENAMEX>.
The proposals call for each side to disclose the exact location of its military units and the quantity and types of its heavy weapons, and they require a 42-day advance warning for call-ups of large reserve forces.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>, the Soviet foreign minister who is visiting here today, said the Soviets have already agreed to one element in the proposal: President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s so-called open-skies plan that would allow inspections from aircraft by either side of the other's territory. The details of the plan are still being worked out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>.
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> proposal would ban most military exercises involving more than 40,000 troops or 800 tanks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> would also permit the U.S. to store some $6 billion of tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Europe</ENAMEX> by lowering overall totals of weapons for active units and allowing both sides to store the additional equipment or to give them to units that are not operational. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> considers the storage sites vital to its commitment to reinforce <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> with 10 Army divisions within 10 days of a crisis.
The proposals also include, for the first time, a limit of 700 portable assault bridges, considered crucial for any invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Europe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> currently has a large number of these bridges positioned along Warsaw Pact borders.
The new package also provides an escape hatch, or so-called non-circumvention provision, for a nation that fears a military buildup on the borders of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, such as Soviet forces behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ural Mountains</ENAMEX>. Any nation that believes ``extraordinary events'' endanger its ``supreme interests'' may withdraw from the proposed conventional arms-control treaty after giving three months' notice.
The escape hatch, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> officials, was the subject of considerable wrangling at alliance headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, where some nations wanted to extend controls beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s borders in certain circumstances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> balked, arguing that this would tempt the Soviets to demand limits on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Sixth Fleet in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean.</ENAMEX>
Another controversial proposal, a U.S. move to allow inspectors to visit arms-production facilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, has been shelved for further study after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> objected that it would violate the secrecy and proprietary nature of their arms industries.
To carry out the verification regime agreed to by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>, a small army of inspectors would be given the right to visit military units on the other side ``at short notice, with no right of refusal.''
Yesterday's proposals are a supplement to an earlier set introduced by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in May at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>. The proposals established overall ceilings on five major weapons: 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces, 28,000 armored troop carriers, 5,700 land-based aircraft and 1,900 helicopters.
The spokesman for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> said that a letter from Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> contains further initiatives in other arms-control areas, including proposals for controlling weapons in space; a new, but undisclosed scheme to control sea-launched cruise missiles; and a more elaborate Soviet proposal to curb the production of fissionable nuclear weapons material, such as plutonium.
He said that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s hopes to complete a conventional weapons-control agreement within six to 12 months would be a ``very difficult task,'' but added that the Soviets will try hard. ``The time is ripe for an agreement.
