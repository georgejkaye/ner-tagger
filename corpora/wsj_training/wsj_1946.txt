In one of the first indoor air-pollution cases to go to trial, a state-court jury decided in favor of the defendant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burlington Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>
The verdict, reached late last week in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>, may end an eight-year legal battle for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greensboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, carpet maker.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon Beebe</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> had sued the com - pany in 1981 after installing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burlington</ENAMEX> carpets in their office. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX> alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick. As a result of their illness, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX> said, they lost $1.8 million in wages and earnings. In addition, they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances.
The case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome. Plaintiffs' lawyers say that buildings become ``sick'' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J. Iaciofano</ENAMEX>, a lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burlington</ENAMEX>, said the company believes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX>' symptoms were not related to the carpeting. He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX>' symptoms appeared months later.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine Adams</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX>' lawyer, said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits. Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX> filed the case, she said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX> now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used in the carpeting. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX> didn't come to that conclusion until time limits had elapsed for adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beebes</ENAMEX> have not yet decided whether to appeal.
TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt setback.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court</ENAMEX> dismissed six lawsuits attempting to block a $2.5 billion project planned for 42nd Street in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>.
Opponents of the project had claimed that the city and the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, which are co-sponsoring the project, had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines.
All but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed since the project's 1984 approval have been dismissed before the trial stage. The two that remain haven't yet reached the pre-trial fact-finding stage.
State officials said the court's ruling clears the way for proceedings to condemn buildings in the area. ``This project is ready to move,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Urban Development Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Tese</ENAMEX>.
But developers of four planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain. As part of the agreement with the state, the developers -- a partnership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park Tower Realty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was ``significant litigation'' pending.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park Tower General</ENAMEX> Counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Mayer</ENAMEX> said the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a $155 million letter of credit to cover condemnation costs. Also, he said, the partnership is waiting to see whether the appellate division's ruling will be appealed.
The plan, which has been plagued with delays and business-related setbacks, seeks to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district.
State and city officials are still negotiating with developers to renovate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel.
FEDERAL JUDGE EXPANDS role of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> courts in extradition decisions.
U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack B. Weinstein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, ruled that a man implicated in an attack on an Israeli passenger bus in 1986 can be extradited to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> for trial.
A magistrate had initially refused the request, ruling that the attack had been a political act for which the man, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud</ENAMEX> El-Abed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad</ENAMEX>, would be exempt from extradition. However, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> wrote in his opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can not be defined as political acts.
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> also ruled that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will be treated fairly in a foreign court. To do so, the judge said, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s assessment. He said that in this case he concurred with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s decision that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad</ENAMEX> should be extradited. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad</ENAMEX>'s lawyer said he would appeal.
Lawyers close to the case said they believed the ruling was unprecedented.
``Up until now the courts have said it is not their role to supervise the foreign country's courts,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Semmelman</ENAMEX>, the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney on the case.
FORMER <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CANADIAN AMBASSADOR</ENAMEX> to the U.S. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan E. Gotlieb</ENAMEX> has joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> law firm of Pepper, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamilton & Scheetz</ENAMEX> as a consultant. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gotlieb</ENAMEX>, who serves as a consultant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stikeman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s biggest law firms, is advising Pepper <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> office on legal matters related to Canadian-U.S. investment, corporate finance and international transactions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUOTABLE</ENAMEX>: In a speech prepared for delivery in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> yesterday, retired Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Powell</ENAMEX> contested the notion that the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> term marked a turn toward conservatism: ``Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a `shift in direction' on the court.... I take these pronouncements, like many that have preceded them in past years, with a grain of salt. In an era of `sound bites' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term.
