A federal judge is giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> a second chance to decide whether to discipline futures trader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Malato</ENAMEX>.
In 1984, the board found Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malato</ENAMEX> and two other Treasury bond-futures traders guilty of breaking exchange rules against pre-arranged trading, among other things. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malato</ENAMEX>'s punishment was the harshest: He was fined $50,000 and suspended from the exchange for seven years.
Arguing that his punishment was too severe, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malato</ENAMEX> appealed the action to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX>. In May, the agency ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Trade</ENAMEX> to return the fine to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malato</ENAMEX> with accrued interest and to end his suspension.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Trade</ENAMEX> said a federal judge here ruled that it had acted properly in punishing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malato</ENAMEX>, and that the judge ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> to allow exchange officials to reconsider Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malato</ENAMEX>'s case. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Trade</ENAMEX> spokesman said the exchange will decide shortly whether to reinstate its early punishment, or take some other action.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malato</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> spokesman Friday said the agency won't comment until it finishes reviewing the ruling.
