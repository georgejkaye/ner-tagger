(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
FOUR YOUNG MEN FROM <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LIVERPOOL</ENAMEX> invaded the U.S. in February 1964. In just two weeks, the Beatles -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Mccartney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lennon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ringo Starr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Harrison</ENAMEX> -- restored momentum to rock'n' roll and boosted the pop music and recording business to new heights.
Starting in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liverpool</ENAMEX> cellar club in 1958, the Beatles enjoyed only middling success until 1963. Strongly influenced by American rhythm-and-blues and by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis Presley</ENAMEX>, the once and future king of rock'n' roll, they made it big when ``She Loves You'' became the largest-selling single record in British history. That, plus TV appearances, created ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beatlemania.</ENAMEX>''
The Beatles made their American debut on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Sullivan</ENAMEX> Show, (drawing an audience of 70 million), followed by performances at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie Hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shea Stadium.</ENAMEX>
The timing was perfect. Young Americans had been devastated by the assassination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kennedy</ENAMEX> in November 1963. The record business and been languishing, and the Beatles brought an exciting -- and better -- brand of music to the rock scene. The promotion behind their arrival was a masterpiece. The four Liverpudlians had cleaned up their act with a well-turned-out look that did not give parents Maalox moments on sight. ``They looked innocent,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown Meggs</ENAMEX>, who in 1964 headed Eastern  operations for Capitol, the Beatles' recording company.
The recording payoff was spectacular. (``A ``A bonanza,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meggs</ENAMEX>, now head of Angel <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Records.</ENAMEX>) Their first LP, ``Meet the Beatles,'' shipped 3.6 million albums. (It has since reached five million) ``Can't Buy Me Love'' topped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX>'s best-selling single. Their first movie, ``Hard Day's Night,'' released in July 1964, was an instant hit.
The Beatles reigned until they broke up in 1970. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Harrison</ENAMEX> looked back and said: ``It sort of turned out all right. And still a lot bigger than we expected.
