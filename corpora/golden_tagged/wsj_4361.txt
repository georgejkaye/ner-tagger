In a successful counterattack, Audi dealers won legal sanctions against a woman who had charged that the Audi 5000 luxury car was prone to ``sudden acceleration.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Weinstein</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, woman who led a publicity campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> and filed five product-liability suits against the company, could end up paying thousands of dollars in damages to two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Audi dealers.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York state</ENAMEX> judge earlier this month ruled in favor of the dealers who charged that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> violated a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law aimed at preventing frivolous lawsuits. The judge set a December hearing to determine how much she will be required to pay the dealers. The maximum allowed by law is $10,000.
Meanwhile, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX>'s urging, a federal judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> plans to hold hearings on whether Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> and her lawyers should be slapped with sanctions for repeatedly suing the auto maker over the same issue: whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> was negligent and liable for selling cars that she claimed unexpectedly accelerated beyond control.
U.S. District Court Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene H. Nickerson</ENAMEX> earlier dismissed Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX>'s three federal suits, including one seeking $5 billion in punitive damages from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen of America Inc.</ENAMEX>, which is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>.
In the state case, a judge decided that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> -- who delayed pretrial fact-finding because her attorney resigned -- wasn't really interested in taking the case to a trial and dismissed it. The auto dealers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koeppel Porsche Audi Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walters</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Porsche Audi</ENAMEX>, countersued, alleging that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> ``willfully used {the} court in a perverted manner'' to, among other things, obtain publicity for her campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX>. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law, defendants in a case can collect costs and attorney's fees if they can prove a plaintiff is unreasonably prolonging a case, or if a case is harassing or maliciously injuring the defendants. Seeking such sanctions is an increasingly popular tactic with businesses facing product-liability suits, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> lawyers say. Federal-court rules similarly call for sanctions against lawyers and plaintiffs who file frivolous lawsuits.
This month, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> appealed the dismissal of her first state suit, although she said she won't challenge the dismissal of the federal cases. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> says she filed five cases because of disagreements between her lawyers over the proper venue for the matter.
For officials with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen of America</ENAMEX>, the court decisions have provided a measure of vindication. ``How do you put things back in balance after you've been brutalized?'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip A. Hutchinson Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen of America</ENAMEX>'s vice president/public affairs, general counsel and secretary. ``The whole thing has been an unfortunate legal episode.''
After an alleged sudden acceleration accident, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinstein</ENAMEX> helped organize the Audi Victims Network in April 1986. Studies by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, Canadian and Japanese transportation agencies concurred with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX>'s reasoning that the problem is likely caused by drivers' stepping on the gas pedal while intending to apply the brakes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRANIFF</ENAMEX>'S  SECOND RETREAT to the refuge of bankruptcy doesn't appear to be improper.
Bankruptcy law specialists said the Braniff that filed for Chapter 11 protection yesterday as a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COR Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> is a substantially different entity from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff International Corp.</ENAMEX> that filed under Chapter 11 in May 1982.
The difference in entities is one test of the propriety of a second Chapter 11 filing; another is the company's progress in adhering to the first plan of reorganization, lawyers say.
``There is always the threshold test of whether it was filed in good faith. If you regularly file Chapter 11 every time the ides of March come around, there could be cause to question your good faith,'' says former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> Bankruptcy Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Gandy</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> appears to have passed the tests for filing the new Chapter 11 case, but it could face some interesting legal challenges, including the question of whether leveraged buy-outs should be treated as an improper transfer of assets prior to a bankruptcy. A group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Chodorow</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> in a $105 million leveraged buy-out last year from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s original Chapter 11 case is still open in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Bankruptcy Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creditors</ENAMEX>, whose original claims totaled $1.5 billion, have yet to be paid in that case. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> is expected to settle by the end of this year from a fund of more than $30 million, most of that from the sale of the carrier to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pritzkers</ENAMEX> in 1983. Under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, a company continues to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Booth</ENAMEX>, the lawyer for the unsecured creditors committee, says his clients shouldn't plan a Christmas-time windfall.
Even with creditors' claims whittled to about $600 million, he says, the payout will equal about five cents on the dollar.
A GROUP of asbestos victims won a round in their suit alleging that the $2.44 billion leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim Walter Co.</ENAMEX> was a fraudulent scheme designed largely to shield the company from mounting asbestos litigation. A state district-court judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beaumont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, refused to dismiss claims against nine of the defendants, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX>, which put together the buy-out; two KKR general partners, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kravis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Roberts</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hillsborough Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX>, a new concern organized in connection with the January 1988 buy-out. The defendants, all based outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, argued in a four-day hearing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> court didn't have jurisdiction, but Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Sanderson</ENAMEX> disagreed, apparently clearing the way for a trial.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAMPA OFFICES</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mesirov</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gelman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jaffe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cramer & Jamieson</ENAMEX> will close.
The 115-lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> law firm says it wants to concentrate its efforts in the mid-Atlantic region. The firm also has an office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cherry Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J. Mesirov</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gelman</ENAMEX>'s seven lawyers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> will join the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX> office of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudnick & Wolfe</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> law firm.
SAME SONG, second verse: A $90 million suit filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Joel</ENAMEX> against his former manager was a response to a breach-of-contract suit that the ex-manager filed Sept. 11, according to a lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Weber</ENAMEX>, who was fired by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> on Aug. 30. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> filed the suit, which seeks damages of $33 million, in state court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX> He claims Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> had no grounds for terminating his contract. The suit also accuses the pop star of damaging Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>'s future earnings by making false accusations about him to others in the entertainment industry. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Marks</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>'s lawyer, said he was unaware of the breach-of-contract suit. ``We don't know anything about it,'' he said, denying that the singer's suit was filed in response. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel A. Gecker</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>'s lawyer, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>'s suit was ``completely groundless.
