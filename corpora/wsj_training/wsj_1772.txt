(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLASTIC PENCILS</ENAMEX>, CODE-NAMED <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">E</ENAMEX>-71, made their hush-hush debut in children's pencil boxes at five-and-dime stores in 1973. But few knew it then and most still think all pencils are wooden.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle Pencil</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shelbyville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pencil City U.S.A.</ENAMEX>,'' had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971. But it wasn't until after it hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur D. Little</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, research concern, that its new product was refined for commercial sale in 1973. Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6, 1973, for the patent, which was assigned and awarded in 1976 to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasbro Industries</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s parent.
Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> incense cedar filled with ceramic lead. It takes five steps to make standard pencils, just one for the plastic type. Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite-plastic cores that are printed, cut, painted and eraser-fitted.
``After more than 200 years, something new has happened to pencils,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur D. Little</ENAMEX> in a 1974 report that publicly described the previously secret item. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil. A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly.
The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3-type pencils, which account for the bulk of the market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artists</ENAMEX> and draftsmen need harder ``leads.''
Eagle, now called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle-Berol</ENAMEX>, remains a leading company among the 10 in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> that produced about 2.3 billion pencils last year, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pencil Makers Association</ENAMEX>. It's a trade secret how many were plastic, and most writers still don't know what they're using.
