Continuing a management shake-up, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Ackerman</ENAMEX>, a former top deputy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX>, will be sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
Until recently, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> clients believed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> would be the successor to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>, the indicted, former junk-bond king.
But in March, another top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milken</ENAMEX> aide, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kissick</ENAMEX>, was placed in charge of junk-bond sales and trading, giving him some of the most important responsibilities formerly handled by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>. The sale, underwriting and trading of the high-risk, high-yield bonds is where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has made the bulk of its money.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX>, 42 years old, would relocate from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s junk-bond headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, to the 350-person <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> operation as of Jan. 1. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> will retain the position of director of international capital market services, which makes him responsible for developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s global junk-bond sales effort and international investment banking activities.
The announcement reinforced speculation on Wall Street that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> had lost a power struggle with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissick</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> officials denied this.
They said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> was never in line to succeed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has been forced in its recent settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> to sever the sales and trading desk of its junk-bond operations from corporate finance, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX>'s specialty. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> declined to comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> officials said that Chief Executive Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Joseph</ENAMEX> asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> about six months ago to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> -- perhaps only for a few years -- to investigate business opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, including the East bloc. At the same time, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> will continue to work on investment-banking transactions, such as Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s hostile bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> has never been a powerful post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>. It currently doesn't have the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> presence of such rivals as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> But, said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> spokesman, ``We're developing a long-term business plan {in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>}, revolving around areas where we have or could have niche businesses, where we have something to add and contribute. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> will be there to help develop this plan.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> has also been elected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s 26-member board, the company said. Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> announced the election to the board of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed W. Khouja</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Delloye</ENAMEX> as representatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bruxelles Lambert</ENAMEX>, a Belgian holding company that owns more than a third of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>.
The move by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> comes during a year of considerable turmoil at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, particularly in its junk-bond operation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has pleaded guilty to six felony counts in connection with various securities-law violations, paid $650 million in penalties and agreed to a high level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> control of its internal operations. People familiar with the case said the government investigated Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> in connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX>'s buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safeway Stores Inc.</ENAMEX>, but the government found no wrongdoing and decided not to charge him.
Associates of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> said his move makes sense because of the current slowdown in junk-bond-financed takeover bids in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and the potentially greater opportunities for such bids in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> officials denied suggestions that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> would welcome an opportunity to distance himself from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s junk-bond trading operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>.
``I'd been trying to persuade Peter to take this job for six months,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> said in an interview. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> transaction requires <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>'s expertise. I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> will be the most knowledgeable financier in leveraged financing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> described Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> -- who has a Ph. D. in international politics -- as ``totally powerful and competent'' and said his move is ``the antithesis of sending him out to pasture.''
Until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> agreed to settle charges brought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> worked side by side with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX> and played a key role in structuring the various junk-bond financings that were sold by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX> and his assistants. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> started at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> in 1973 and joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s junk-bond desk in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> in 1978.
It's unclear how well Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> will be able to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s transactionstructuring activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> from his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> outpost. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> said distance shouldn't be a problem, to judge by past experience at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>.
``When we moved the high-yield department to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX>, people speculated it couldn't work,'' he said. ``But we find talking by telephone is exactly as efficient as walking down to the trading floor and talking face to face.
