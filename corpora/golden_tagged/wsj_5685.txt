More bad oil news is coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>.
Although it has been obscured by fallout from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> Valdez oil spill, production in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>'s big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX> field has peaked and is declining. Output is expected to fall an average 150,000 barrels a day this year from the 1.6 million a day produced in 1988. Experts estimate that in 1990 and beyond, production will continue falling at between 4% and 10% a year.
In the oil world, that development isn't a surprise. No oil fields last forever. Among some of the oil companies operating on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Slope</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield Co.</ENAMEX>, the only surprise is that production hadn't slowed earlier.
Still, the realization that output at the fabled Prudhoe field is slipping is setting off alarms in the industry -- and may do the same soon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. The field accounts for 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil output, and its reduced flow would increase U.S. dependence on oil imports. That in turn could add to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit and influence future U.S. energy policies.
Production didn't begin from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX> until 1977, after years of political debate over the building of a pipeline across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>. The field was discovered a decade earlier on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>'s frigid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Slope</ENAMEX>. Its initial 10 billion barrels of proven reserves made it <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s largest and one of only 35 so-called supergiants -- those with five billion barrels or more of recoverable oil -- ever discovered. It soon became a cornerstone of operations for some of the world's biggest oil companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX>, which jointly discovered it.
The peaking of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX> production is believed to have been a major factor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX>'s decision to restructure its operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX>'s biggest oil holding is in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe</ENAMEX>, and it operates half the field. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BP</ENAMEX> announced last week it is selling $1.31 billion in oil and gas assets and shaking up its world-wide exploration business to spend more money on a ``frontier'' search for new oil reserves.
Oil experts say the drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX>'s production underscores the seriousness of the deterioration of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s petroleum base. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> was once the world's largest oil producer, and until this year, increasing Alaskan output helped offset the plunge in production in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>.
Between 1985 and 1988, Alaskan crude oil production, the bulk of it from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX>, increased more than 200,000 barrels a day to two million barrels a day, notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Lichtblau</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petroleum Industry Research Foundation</ENAMEX>. During that period, he adds, output in the remainder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> dropped one million barrels a day to 6.1 million barrels.
``For the last several years, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX> has been the principal factor in offsetting the declines in the lower 48 states,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lichtblau</ENAMEX>, ``but now it isn't doing that any more.''
No one is writing off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX> isn't the only major field in the state. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuparuk</ENAMEX>, the second-largest oil field in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, also is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Slope</ENAMEX>. And there are others, including a recent significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield</ENAMEX> discovery called the Point <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcintyre</ENAMEX>. ``We still see a long life ahead for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>,'' says an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield</ENAMEX> spokesman.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard J. Picchi</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> oil analyst recently in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> for an on-the-spot look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Point Mcintyre</ENAMEX> and other fields, agrees. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> has an incredible resource base,'' he says.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Picchi</ENAMEX> and others worry about the strong anti-oil attitude that has sprung up following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> tanker spill. They say that may eliminate or postpone the possible discovery and development of new Alaskan fields to replace Prudhoe.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valdez</ENAMEX> incident has created much negative damage -- a setback for any attempts to make up routine declines in existing fields,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brice Sachs</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> planner who is now an energy consultant based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Morristown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>
Among the casualties, he and others note, is any exploration soon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</ENAMEX>. The refuge, or Anwar as it's commonly called, is believed to contain the types of geological structures that could harbor deposits of oil on a par with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX>. But industry officials concede the political impossibility of exploring for oil there for at least two to three years.
Even if big fields exist there, with the lag time needed for development, oil couldn't flow until the next century.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meantime</ENAMEX>, the decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prudhoe Bay</ENAMEX>'s production, combined with disruptions in shipping oil from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Valdez</ENAMEX> spill in March, will result in a decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Slope</ENAMEX> output to fewer than 1.9 million barrels a day this year, from two million a day last year. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> produces a modest 40,000 barrels a day outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Slope.</ENAMEX>)
This drop is having a noticeable effect on U.S. crude-oil output. Industry officials say it is accelerating the erosion that has been entrenched since the 1986 oil-price crash and subsequent drilling collapse. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Petroleum Institute</ENAMEX> says domestic oil output is suddenly falling at an average annual rate of 5% to 6%, nearly double the 3%-plus declines of recent years. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">API</ENAMEX> reports production for August averaged 7.5 million barrels a day, down from nearly 8.1 million barrels a year earlier and the lowest figure in 25 years.
Oil imports are climbing faster than U.S. production is shrinking because domestic consumption of petroleum is increasing. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">API</ENAMEX>, imports totaled nearly 8.6 million barrels a day in August, up from 7.4 million a year earlier.
