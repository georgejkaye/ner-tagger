Many of the recent airline alliances struck between European carriers or between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines are ``more smoke than substance,'' according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert L. Crandall</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>.
In an interview in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> said American doesn't intend to join the crowd. First of all, U.S. antitrust laws prohibit American from entering the sort of agreements into which European carriers are rushing. Secondly, ``it's not that we don't believe in partnerships, but we haven't been able to identify the substance of a marketing alliance,'' he said.
That isn't to say that the largest U.S. airline isn't talking to a variety of potential partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and elsewhere, however. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> said his airline is talking with both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> about so-called code-sharing on a limited number of routes. That would entail coordinating flight schedules so that, say, an American flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> could funnel traffic onto an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> plane headed to another destination. The two flights would be listed as one in world-wide computer reservations networks. ``But we can't jointly do a route,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> added, at least not without facing scrutiny from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Justice Department</ENAMEX>.
He said the talks with other carriers center on a few routes where real commercial opportunities exist. U.S. regulations on code-sharing limit such links to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> destinations where foreign carriers already have traffic rights. American already has code-sharing arrangements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qantas</ENAMEX>, the Australian carrier, and is negotiating similar links with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay Pacific Airways</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air New Zealand.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX>, en route to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> board meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, said his airline also is discussing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> the possibility of jointly developing a world-wide computer system for cargo. Additionally, American's computer reservations unit Sabre is talking to the European computer reservations system Amadeus about some sort of collaboration.
He said a link between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sabre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amadeus</ENAMEX>, which counts among its owners <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX>, could take the form of a share swap, an unbalanced investment or a software contract. He said American's interest in such a deal is motivated more by seeking to position Sabre world-wide than in boosting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American's</ENAMEX> stock price to discourage U.S. takeover artists from making a play for the airline.
``We have to be aware of the interest of financial buyers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> said. To give shareholders additional value, American has looked at many options, including selling shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sabre</ENAMEX>, he said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> declined to comment on any overtures American may have received from corporate raiders.
But he poured cold water on accords such as the one announced yesterday between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian Airlines System</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX>, or the one reached two weeks ago between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>. ``What is it that you're going to do for one another that you're not going to do for another airline?'' he said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airlines</ENAMEX> aren't going to turn down business because of their partners, he added.
Under U.S. antitrust law, which is extraterritorial, it is illegal for carriers to team up in purchasing airplanes, and probably illegal to operate joint-venture flights. Both of those ideas are contained in some new European airline accords.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> predicted that the completion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>'s internal market after 1992 will subject aviation to European protectionism. He said the only way around this obstacle is internal growth and selected partnerships.
European law ``limits our ability to invest in airlines here {in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>},'' he said. ``I doubt we're ever going to be permitted to be a majority owner of a European airline.'' On the U.S. side, regulators prohibit foreign companies from owning more than 25% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines or from exercising control.
Regarding trans-Atlantic airline investments, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX>' planned 15% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airline</ENAMEX>'s planned stake of 25% in the cash equity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> said: ``I think they'll have effects.... But we're not tremendously concerned about them.'' As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United's</ENAMEX> plans to start flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> next year, he said, ``Welcome aboard.''
American, the third-largest U.S. carrier to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in market share after Pan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American World Airways</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX>, is continuing its rapid expansion. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> said American plans to add <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stuttgart</ENAMEX> to its list of destinations in November. Next spring, the carrier hopes to open additional routes. The list of possible cities includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glasgow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>. The carrier also is considering services to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Budapest</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Helsinki</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>. Some of the new services will orginate from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American's</ENAMEX> hubs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Juan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, he said.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>'s foreign routes or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Airline</ENAMEX>'s Latin American routes become available, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> added, ``we'll be there'' as a buyer. But for the moment, American's overseas expansion is tempered by a lack of airplanes.
``The big story isn't strategic alliances and globalization,'' the executive said. ``The story is... that the demand for travel is limitless.'' He said governments should be encouraging airline competition and improving airport and air-traffic control infrastructure to accommodate that travel demand.
Restrictive government policies and some of the recent airline alliances illustrate that ``people are worrying too much about preserving their piece of the existing pie,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> said, ``instead of trying to make the pie bigger.
