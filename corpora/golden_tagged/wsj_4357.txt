Believe it or not, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> is going to prove a much sunnier clime than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palm Springs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, for the next few days.
That is the forecast, anyway, for Machinists union leaders who are holed up in hotel suites at both locations forging new labor agreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Corp.</ENAMEX>
During the past few triennial sessions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> accord has served as the industry trend-setter. But this time, with commercial aircraft orders flourishing and military markets drying up, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> is sure to resist signing a pact that's as generous as what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> can afford. Neither company will comment.
``Certainly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> is not as well off,'' acknowledges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Baker</ENAMEX>, who as president of union District 751 represents some 40,000 of the 55,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> rank and file covered by the accord. ``I think the guys down there are going to have some tough bargaining ahead.''
Not that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and his team at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> Westin are sipping tall drinks poolside. In an interview before going into meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> indicated that the most serious economic issues -- save for some discussion about cost-of-living adjustments -- had yet to even be broached. But before the contract expires Tuesday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is most certainly going to oppose the union's push for a base-wage increase.
Yet without a doubt, the vigor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s balance sheet has given the Machinists confidence that the bulk of their demands will be met this year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>, three-quarters of whose revenue is derived from its commercial-jetliner business, reported a 20% gain in net income through the first six months. Now, the Machinists want their share.
By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> -- where 20,000 workers have a stake in the negotiations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palm Springs</ENAMEX> Marquis -- is suffering much more from federal budget battles and the resultant near-paralysis at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. Beset by cost overruns, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calabasas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, aerospace giant posted a 37% plunge in profit for the first half. ``The military sector has never been bleaker,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Rubel</ENAMEX>, an aerospace analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.</ENAMEX>
Machinists haggling with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX>, where the contract for an additional 6,800 hourly employees is set to expire, faces a similarly difficult challenge. The nation's No. 1 defense contractor also makes commercial airplanes, but its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, transport operations are in disarray after a major restructuring. In the second quarter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based company suffered a $48 million net loss.
``This is just not a good time to be bargaining with'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas</ENAMEX>, explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Griffith</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Auto Workers</ENAMEX> Local 148, which represents 15,500 aerospace workers at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Beach</ENAMEX>. He adds that in 1987 he pushed for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAW</ENAMEX> contract that extends all the way to March 1991 because he foresaw ``the tremendous upheaval and change'' that a restructuring would bring.
Some Machinists nonetheless insist that whatever the union wins at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> eventually will be swallowed by the two other manufacturers -- wages included. ``The fact is that historically these companies have maintained the same labor costs, regardless of their product mix,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justin Ostro</ENAMEX>, the Machinists' international general vice president.
After all, says the 39-year veteran of industry bargaining, the entire membership ``basically does the same work'' and, therefore, is entitled to the same pay and the same benefits.
However, other union officials concede that such high hopes are unrealistic in 1989. ``The military side has slowed down, and I'm sure concerned about it,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Carver</ENAMEX>, who is squaring off against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lockheed</ENAMEX> as president of District 727. Yesterday, he issued a letter to union members, saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> has proposed a medical plan under which workers could see their deductibles increase as much as fivefold, depending on salary. ``The company is very serious about raiding our contract and stripping away our benefits and wages,'' he wrote.
Though getting a pay raise is the paramount goal for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carver</ENAMEX>'s brethren at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>, non-monetary matters have been the dominant issues so far. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> says the union has made especially good progress in securing guarantees that members won't be laid off because of injuries. The Machinists are also seeking from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> a jointly funded data bank to better track illness in the workplace. Lessening overtime is another important objective.
But at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX>, it's the basic struggle for dollars and the preservation of benefits and jobs themselves that are at the fore. ``On the surface we have to say one thing, but we can't possibly hope to match what they'll get at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>,'' says a union insider familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> situation. ``We have to focus on things like job security, given our situation.''
Basic economics offers no other choice. ``It takes supply and demand to determine wages -- not just supply,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Troy</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rutgers University</ENAMEX> professor. ``There's no question that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> workers are in a weaker position.''
Some analysts think even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> may be able to exploit the softness in the defense sector. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Smith</ENAMEX>, an aerospace analyst and consultant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raymond James & Associates</ENAMEX>, says the company ``would be apoplectic if they gave away the store.'' While there is pressure on the company to keep production cranking -- it has finally gotten its 747 deliveries back on schedule, for example -- he notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s own military business is shrinking.
And, most important, there is a surplus of workers around the country who have been laid off at other defense facilities. In fact, in 1988 the level of overall industry employment fell for the first time since 1983, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospace Industries Association</ENAMEX>, and is expected to slip slightly again this year.
If push came to shove, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> ``could have 10,000 new applicants in a heartbeat,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> says. ``I'm not sure the word scab even applies in a declining and consolidating industry. It's every man for himself.'' Aerospace workers are famous for being itinerant careerists.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> workers have authorized their leadership to call for strikes, if need arises.
Whether there actually will be a work stoppage, though, is increasingly unclear. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> says he expects ``some give and take on both sides,'' giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> workers a very measured wage increase combined with productivity-based bonuses. Such a package would be similar to those struck recently in other cyclical industries, such as aluminum and steel.
So far, the talks are reported to be going smoothly -- though there is an increased awareness that time is running out. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> says he is ``starting to get worried that we haven't made any real progress'' on many of the most fractious issues dividing the company and union.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carver</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palm Springs</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> resort town, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lockheed</ENAMEX> on Monday put a typical first proposal on the table -- asking for concessions on everything. ``I can't take it seriously,'' he says.
