BACK <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT THE RACKS</ENAMEX>, women help buoy retail sales. But for how long?
After languishing since ``the great miniskirt debacle'' of 1987, women's apparel sales are on the rise, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Regan</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson, Lufkin</ENAMEX> analyst. But he notes recent hefty gains may be harder to sustain. ``The career closets are stocked,'' he says, noting much of the buying was simply to replace worn-out wardrobes. And, analysts expect discounts to cut into important Christmas receipts. The Limited already discounts fall clothes and cash-strapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abraham & Straus)</ENAMEX> may use markdowns to move goods, prompting others to follow.
Meanwhile, women still search for that something ``to die for'' before they have to find something to die in. Reports of success are few. Chanel slaves are still chained in gold to the boxy knit and bony knee look and loving it, retailers say. Silver, suede and animal prints gain favor, but no shape, color or style issues a new ``statement.'' Popular fashion is staid: skirts that skim past the knee, trousers that flounce, shoulders that aren't quite so big, earth tones.
After a lawsuit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> offers free tailoring on some ladies wear. A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A*/NNP&S</ENAMEX> promises free alterations in an hour.
DOC-IN-A-BOX came first. Now medical niches mushroom as physicians compete.
Walk-in surgery centers led the way in stressing service over stately medical care. Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Call Doc Medical Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> takes its general services straight to the consumer's door in an equipment-packed van with a lab and pharmacy. ``It's one-stop shopping,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gresham Bayne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M.D.</ENAMEX>, an owner and one of the emergency-room physicians who staff the van. After four years, Call Doc eyes expansion. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayne</ENAMEX> says: ``We're still not sure what our niche is. Nobody's marketed medicine much.''
But they're learning. A brochure handed out near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> promotes four medical groups, including an ear, nose and throat practice managed by attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Romo</ENAMEX> for his doctor brother. Advertising ``is almost dictated by where you are,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romo</ENAMEX> says. ``If you're {visible} down on a ground floor in a normal {not <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>} city, you don't need it.'' The watchdog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical Association</ENAMEX> growls at overly hyped ads, but bumps heads with federal regulators guarding doctors' rights.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ATLANTIC CITY</ENAMEX>'S real gamblers may be investors in junk-bond financed casinos.
With Merv <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts International</ENAMEX> on the restructuring ropes and given the junk-bond market's generally wobbly state these days, the odds seem to be building against investors. Analysts say the weak market probably won't cause immediate problems for casinos already loaded with debt. But it may torpedo some recapitalization plans using junk bonds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropworld</ENAMEX>, just postponed an offering, and Holiday, owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harrah</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina</ENAMEX>, mulls an issue.
Stakes are high. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Papers</ENAMEX> filed with regulators show the city's 12 casinos have $3.14 billion in long-term debt, mostly junk. But casinos are more leveraged than they appear, considering the parents' junk. Besides Resorts with $925 million, the biggest casino debtors: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally's</ENAMEX> Park Place, $520 million; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump Castle</ENAMEX>, $348 million; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump Plaza</ENAMEX>, $273.5 million.
Regulators figure under 20% of the $2.1 billion in debt since 1985 was actually used for new construction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNFLUORIDATED</ENAMEX> BOTTLED water prompts a cautionary letter in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX>. A recent study of 12 popular brands found only one (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Perrier</ENAMEX>) met EPA fluoride targets. If the trend away from tap water lowers fluoride intake, supplements may be in order, writes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheila Mcguire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.D.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Dental School</ENAMEX>.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PATRON</ENAMEX> SAINT of hairdressers is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin de Porres</ENAMEX>. That's one of the many revelations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Public Library Desk Reference</ENAMEX>. The initial 848-page hardcover was inspired by the four million or so calls the library answers each year.
A BAROMETER of retail sales is reborn. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Council of Shopping Centers</ENAMEX> pays the government $100,000 a year to generate data on 125 markets cut from Census budgets; it vows fewer revisions.
REJECTED for a coveted $50 million grant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Combustion Engineering</ENAMEX> forges on.
The ailing nuclear power industry pins its hopes on a sort of ``junior'' reactor: one that's smaller, safer, cheaper. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> each recently won a federal grant to develop such a design. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Combustion</ENAMEX> didn't and now looks to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>. ``It's a global market and we're now going to focus on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K</ENAMEX>''. a spokesman says.
The firm earlier formed a consortium with the U.K. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atomic Energy Authority</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolls-Royce</ENAMEX> to explore development. With a stiff upper lip, Combustion points out that there are several older power stations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> that will be decommissioned in the 1990s that could be ripe sites. Its new reactor would rely on a ``passive'' cooling system that uses gravity and other natural forces to operate. Existing plants use pumps and piping which critics say offers more margin for failure.
U.S. nuclear plants generated 15% more power in 1988 but costs rose 22%: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barker & Sloane</ENAMEX> survey.
BRIEFS: In the same day's mail: a survey from Trump Shuttle saying its fliers favor Trumplane over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>; and a note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> is fighting the shuttle war on its stomach, offering free frozen Elan yogurt to waiting passengers.... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teatime</ENAMEX>'s astir as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons Tetley</ENAMEX> unwraps a round teabag.
