We've heard <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Koppel</ENAMEX> came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Katz</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prop</ENAMEX>. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> happily agreed, sliding over the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s roads and bridges aren't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes. Both have been raised at least 30% in recent years, even while the price of gasoline has fallen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragging Prop.</ENAMEX> 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch.
