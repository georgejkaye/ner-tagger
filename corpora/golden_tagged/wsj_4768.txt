<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> said its board approved a proposed management-led leveraged buy-out for a premium price of $25.50 a share, or $750 million.
The news sent the company's stock soaring to $24.625, up $4.625 in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
The announcement comes on the eve of a turnover in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>-based company's top management. Earlier this year, the maker of parts for building and transportation industries announced the planned retirements of its founder and chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Philips</ENAMEX>, and its vice chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert H. Brethen</ENAMEX>. Both men support the proposed buy-out and stand to pocket millions of dollars if it succeeds.
``It enables them to go out in a blaze of glory,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Schlang</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prescott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ball & Turbin.</ENAMEX>
Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> will merge with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLPI Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLPI Holdings</ENAMEX>, which was formed for this acquisition, has received commitments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> for as much as $250 million in subordinated debt and from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Appreciation Fund</ENAMEX> II for as much as $150 million of equity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> said its management would have a significant equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MLPI Holdings</ENAMEX>, but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Appreciation Fund</ENAMEX> would have a majority share.
The $25.50 per-share offer represents a significant premium over the price the stock has been trading at prior to yesterday's runup. The company's 52-week high is $23.25.
The premium price, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlang</ENAMEX> said, derives from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>' excellent track record. Its management has excelled in keeping costs down and has had 13 consecutive years of increased earnings in spite of the cyclical nature of the construction industry. The company also anticipates record earnings of $1.70 a share for the year ending March 31, 1990, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schlang</ENAMEX> said.
For this year ending last March 31, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> earned $46.3 million, or $1.61 a share, compared with $43.2 million, or $1.52 a share for the previous year. Sales increased to $941.7 million from $692.5 million.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philips</ENAMEX>, who will retire Oct. 23 on his 75th birthday, owns 6.6% of 28.9 million shares outstanding. If the proposed buy-out is completed, he will gain $48.6 million. The 62-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brethen</ENAMEX>, who will retire Dec. 31, owns 1.3% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>' stock outstanding, and his gain will be $9.6 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> hasn't named a successor for the posts of chief executive or chairman, however, current executives are expected to fill the positions.
Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Mccanna</ENAMEX>, 49, was named chief operating officer, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Deering</ENAMEX>, 49, was named president, succeeding Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brethen</ENAMEX>. The company has said the  positions of chairman and chief executive will be filled by either Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccanna</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deering</ENAMEX>.
The proposed buy-out is subject to approval by a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>' common shareholders, and the agreement allows the board to accept other bids.
