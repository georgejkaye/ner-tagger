<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defenders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> sugar-subsidy program have always misled the public about the program's true nature. However, now they confuse reality even further by misstating the actual pricing structure for the domestic sugar industry.
The government controls domestic prices. The ``loan rate'' for raw sugar is set at 18 cents a pound by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. However, contrary to assertions by domestic producers (Letters, Sept. 12), the loan rate is not the level at which they are supported.
Because the cost of the sugar program is required by law to be borne by consumers rather than taxpayers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> created the ``market stabilization price'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MSP</ENAMEX>), which is several cents above the loan rate. Now set at 21.8 cents a pound for raw sugar, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSP</ENAMEX> is a price floor that is defended by limiting the sugar supply through quotas on imports.
The actual market price for raw sugar reflects the relative balance between demand and available supply. Prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USDA</ENAMEX>'s recent announcement to increase sugar imports slightly, the raw-sugar price had jumped to three cents above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSP</ENAMEX> -- to 25 cents a pound The average price received by raw-sugar producers is about 1.5 cents below the quoted market price due to transportation costs.
Thus, the true price received by U.S. growers has ranged from about 20 1/2 cents a pound to 23 1/2 cents over the past several years. This is well above the 18-cent loan rate and far more than is necessary to encourage efficient domestic and foreign growers to supply sugar to the U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> must reduce these sugar subsidies when it writes the 1990 Farm Bill.
