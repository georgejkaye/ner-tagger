In terms of sheer brutality, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somali</ENAMEX> regime of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siad Barre</ENAMEX> may rank as No. 1 in the world. The only reason that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX> remains in obscurity is numbers: a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill.
Beheading small children, stabbing elderly people to death, raping and shooting women, and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somali</ENAMEX> armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years.
Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> because of the behavior of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>'s troops.
In the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berbera</ENAMEX>, for example, hundreds of men of the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Issak</ENAMEX> clan were rounded up in May 1988, imprisoned, and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever. Guns were never used: Each man was stabbed to death with a large knife.
The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report, based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees. The study was done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gersony</ENAMEX>, a consultant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. State Department</ENAMEX> who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide.
What gives these events particular significance, however, is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> on the horn of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. Not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>'s rule is crumbling fast. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutinies</ENAMEX> wrack his armed forces (really just an armed gang), which control less than half the country. Inflation is at record levels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desperate</ENAMEX>, he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Somali National Movement</ENAMEX> in the north, which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mogadishu</ENAMEX>. Seventy years old and a self-declared ``scientific socialist,'' President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX> has a power base, composed only of his minority Mareham clan, that according to observers is ``narrowing.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX> consists of a single runway at the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berbera</ENAMEX>, which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf of Aden</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX>. That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story, air-conditioned shacks where a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American nationals</ENAMEX> -- buttressed by imported food, cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world. In the past two years, the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy, where, due to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>'s brutality and ineptitude, nobody is any longer in control.
As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu Haile Mariam</ENAMEX> held a total gridlock over neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets' array of airfields next door. But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks, those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as [the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American runway].</ENAMEX>
On Sept. 7, I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eritrean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tigrean</ENAMEX> guerrillas. Recently, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wollo</ENAMEX> province in the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tigrean</ENAMEX> forces have killed, wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops. (Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, a small country of little strategic importance )
Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Addis Ababa</ENAMEX>, threatening the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dese</ENAMEX>, which would cut off Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX>'s capital from the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assab</ENAMEX>, through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ababa</ENAMEX>. As a result, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eritrea</ENAMEX> just to hold the town, thereby risking the loss of even more territory in Eritrea only to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tigreans</ENAMEX> at bay.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> is in an increasingly weak position: Half his army is tied down defending the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern</ENAMEX> city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asmara</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eritreans</ENAMEX>. The weaker he gets, the more he turns toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for help. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tigreans</ENAMEX> are communists, like the Eritreans they are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in the world, having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the Soviet-supplied Mengistu air force.
What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> is collapsing as fast as President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>'s regime in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX> is. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, therefore, has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX> and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>.
Back to Somalia:
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, to its credit, has already begun distancing itself from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>, evinced by its decision to publish the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gersony</ENAMEX> report (which the press has ignored). What's more, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has suspended $2.5 million in military aid and $1 million in economic aid.
But this is not enough. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is still perceived to be tied to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>, when he goes the runway could go too. Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway, the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly, in terms clear enough for all  influential Somalis to understand. It is a certainty that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>'s days are numbered. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> should take care, however, that its own position in the country does not go down with him.
Nobody is sure what will come next in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX> or whom the successor might be. But as one expert tells me: ``Whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>.''
While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> positions itself for the post-Barre period in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX>, it should continue to back former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>'s well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eritrean</ENAMEX> guerrillas in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>, while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tigrean</ENAMEX> rebels through neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sudan</ENAMEX>.
Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated, secretive and Byzantine in all of black <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>. Remember that it took Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mengistu</ENAMEX> many months, in what became known as the ``creeping coup,'' to topple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emperor Haile Selassie</ENAMEX> in 1974 and 1975. There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly, as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has one great advantage: The Soviets are universally loathed throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX> for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all.
It's not just in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side, but on the horn of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> as well. The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barre</ENAMEX>, and that should be cut fast.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan</ENAMEX>, author of ``Surrender or Starve: The Wars Behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Famine</ENAMEX>'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Westview Press</ENAMEX>, 1988), lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lisbon</ENAMEX>.
