<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Cannavino</ENAMEX>, head of its personal computer operations, as general manager of the group that includes both personal computers and workstations.
He succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard T. Gerstner</ENAMEX>, who has a chronic back problem that has kept him from working full-time and who will move into an unspecified, special assignment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannavino</ENAMEX>, 45 years old, will bring more technical knowledge to the job than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> possessed -- at a time when the line between personal computers and workstations is blurring, creating a confusing array of technical choices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Albert</ENAMEX>, who recently left the computer company and is now a consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scarsdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, pointed to the various operating systems, user interfaces and chip technologies that are vying for control of the personal computer and workstation markets and said: ``That complexity is something that plays to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannavino</ENAMEX>'s strengths.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannavino</ENAMEX> began as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> repairman as a teen-ager and, without benefit of a college degree, worked his way up the product side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>. Before being appointed 10 months ago as president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s personal computer division -- a position he retains -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannavino</ENAMEX> spent several years with responsibility for developing mainframes.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannavino</ENAMEX> is also known as someone who will make a decision quickly and not waffle -- a trait that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Akers</ENAMEX> has been stressing as he has tried to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> faster on its feet.
At the same time, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannavino</ENAMEX> lacks the broad experience on the business side that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX> had. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerstner</ENAMEX>, the 50-year-old brother of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Gerstner</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>, was, among other things, one of two executives generally credited with turning around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s Japanese operations.
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannavino</ENAMEX> gears up for his biggest immediate challenge, the expected announcement soon of personal computers from the so-called Gang of Nine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has scheduled a press briefing for tomorrow that industry executives said is designed to launch a preemptive attack.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Armonk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, declined to comment on the substance of the meeting. But the industry executives said the main point will be that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s controversial data pathway, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro Channel</ENAMEX>, can transmit information two to four times as fast as is now done when one part of the personal computer talks to another. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is expected to say this gives the Micro Channel a top speed of 80 megabytes a second, compared with 33 for the Gang of Nine's EISA data bus. The executives added that this won't require a so-called Micro Channel 2, as has been rumored; the capability is already present in current machines.
The Gang of Nine, a group of PC makers led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> that is pushing to make its EISA data pathway the industry standard instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro Channel</ENAMEX>, has argued that such speed comparisons are meaningless because the bus isn't the bottleneck that keeps personal computers from operating faster, except in a very small number of cases. The group also points out that, while circuit boards had to be redesigned to fit into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro Channel</ENAMEX>, what it calls standard circuit boards will still be able to fit into its machines.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is clearly hoping to set the terms of the debate that will go on for many months. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cannavino</ENAMEX> said in an interview Friday that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EISA</ENAMEX> group has ``decided to try to be compatible with the cards {circuit boards} in the past.... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Micro Channel</ENAMEX> stands here and looks forward. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EISA</ENAMEX> stands here and looks backward.''
The industry executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will also announce a chip set that will help outside companies develop circuit boards for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro Channel</ENAMEX>. Most boards to this point are 16-bit boards, meaning they can grab or transmit 16 bits of data at a time, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> chip set will be aimed at development of 32-bit boards.
The executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> won't announce either of two machines it is rumored to be working on: one using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX>'s new 486 processor or a 33 megahertz version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel</ENAMEX> 386, the fastest version of that chip available. They said it still isn't certain whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will be able to announce tomorrow or ever the availability of circuit boards demonstrated this summer that contain a 486 processor and can be used to soup up existing machines.
