<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guido Carli</ENAMEX> called for the adoption of a full-scale privatization program in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> to help narrow the country's budget deficit and reduce political meddling in the economy.
Speaking to a conference of international securities regulators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venice</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carli</ENAMEX> said that ``history has taught us that the democracy of the market is the only one which can restrain the enormous, often unjustified spaces'' controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s politicians. The sale of state-owned properties to the market is the only way in which ``the appointment of directors of firms belonging to the public sector can be legitimately removed from political power.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carli</ENAMEX>'s comments come less than a week after he lambasted the former management of state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s biggest bank, for negligence in the scandal surrounding its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> branch in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>. As previously reported, the branch, which had an individual lending limit of $500,000, extended about $3 billion of credit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> without authorization.
The scandal has raised dozens of questions about possible involvement by the Italian or even U.S. governments, and accusations that the loans were being used to finance unauthorized arms transactions. So far, however, no company or person has been charged with a crime in connection with the investigation. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carli</ENAMEX> is scheduled to appear before parliament tomorrow to answer questions.
The scandal also has hurt the bank's international reputation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based rating agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBCA</ENAMEX> yesterday downgraded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>'s individual rating to C from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B/C.</ENAMEX> The individual rating refers to a bank's overall performance, and the C rating is below average for major international banks.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carli</ENAMEX> didn't mention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> in particular in his speech yesterday. But the former central bank governor and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S.p. A.</ENAMEX> director has sometimes been criticized as representing the views of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> and other big industrial companies. The reason is that many in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> fear that if banks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> were privatized, the only ones with enough money to buy them would be the big industrial groups, which already dominate much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s economic landscape. Some 80% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s banks are state-owned; no large banks are privately owned.
