<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oops</ENAMEX>. There goes the air out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> again.
The shares, which spurted on heavy volume Sept. 7 and 8, deflated 12% last week amidst general anguish for rumored takeover stocks.
Even at Friday's close of 63, many analysts and money managers say, buyers essentially are speculating on a takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>, as the stock otherwise is fully valued. Fundamentals justify the current price, they say, but not much more.
Takeovers suddenly look tougher to carry out because ``the bottom is falling out of the junk-bond market,'' one money manager says. And a raider without junk-bond financing is like Zorro without his sword.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>'s shares have trended upward for the past year, helped partly by strength in its specialty retailing units. Analysts are especially keen on its Foot Locker stores. ``The athletic-shoe business has been very good to them,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> money manager. ``But it's a $4 billion market now. It's a maturing market. Absent a takeover, the stock is expensive.''
``In the low 50s the stock was a screaming buy on fundamentals,'' says another money manager, who bought at that price but sold too soon -- for a mere 4-point profit. She now considers the shares ``fully priced.''
The stock is a ``hold to a sell,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Johnson</ENAMEX>, analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prescott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ball & Turben</ENAMEX>. He expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> to earn about $5.60 a share in 1990. Applying a multiple of 11 times earnings, he thinks the stock is worth about 61.
Some analysts still like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> on fundamentals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX> put the big retailer on its recommended list last month, as analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Missett</ENAMEX> praised its acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champs</ENAMEX>, a sporting-goods and sports-apparel chain.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Raiff</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX> last October called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> ``one of the few remaining great values.'' The stock then was at 52 to 57. When it passed 70 last week, he called it ``fairly valued.'' On the slip back to 63, he said, ``I'm a buyer.'' He thinks the stock could sell for 75 next year on fundamentals, and close to 100 in a restructuring or takeover.
Still, much of the buying these days comes from speculators. Takeover rumors have flickered since May 1984. The latest chitchat features the usual suspect, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meshulam Riklis</ENAMEX>, though other names pop up, too.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riklis</ENAMEX>'s closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapid American Corp.</ENAMEX> controls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccrory</ENAMEX>'s, a discount chain that competes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>. He is deemed a logical buyer for two reasons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rapid American</ENAMEX> held 3% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> back in 1983 (it apparently sold the holding in 1985). Also, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riklis</ENAMEX> recently pocketed some $1.5 billion by selling two cosmetics companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faberge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Arden</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever N.V.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riklis</ENAMEX>, who couldn't be reached, has declined to comment on similar rumors in the past.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interstate Properties</ENAMEX>, a closely held investment partnership in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teaneck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, is also mentioned as a potential buyer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Managing</ENAMEX> partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell White</ENAMEX> declines to comment.
Other, vaguer, rumors deal with an unidentified foreign buyer or an American buyer that covets <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX>'s real estate. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> has large and valuable real-estate holdings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.) The takeover speculation has spilled over into the options market, with heavy buying of calls (options to purchase a certain amount of stock at a set price until a specified date).
``They're flocking to these calls like bees go to honey,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Fishback</ENAMEX>, director of research for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment Research Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>. But he thinks buying calls based on widely circulated rumors is usually unsuccessful. Options buyers who got in a few days ago have already taken a bath. One popular option (the November call to buy the stock at 60) reached a high of nearly 14, but fell back to 6 3/8 Friday.
Several market-watchers doubt the rumors. They note that volume in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> common stock peaked Sept. 7 and 8 at more than a million shares a day, triple the normal level but probably not heavy or sustained enough to indicate a major accumulation of shares by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riklis</ENAMEX>. ``I'm pretty sure someone has taken a stake,'' said an official of a stock-watch firm. (Such firms are paid to provide corporations with early warning when a raider is accumulating stock.) ``But from what I can gather, it's less than 5%. They could be in and out.''
The market as a whole looks a little woozy to some people, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average was up Friday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technician</ENAMEX> and newsletter writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Granville</ENAMEX> says 359 stocks (15% of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> issues) are within a point of making new 12-month lows. New lows outnumbered new highs Thursday (28-14) for the first time since March. He continues to predict an ``October massacre.''
