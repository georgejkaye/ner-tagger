A television special produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Audubon Society</ENAMEX> was broadcast last night without commercials on a cable channel owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX> after eight advertisers pulled out because of pressure from the logging industry, the program's producers said.
The special, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ancient Forests</ENAMEX>: Rage Over Trees,'' was aired with public-service announcements instead of the scheduled commercials. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> declined to release the names of the sponsors, other officials close to the process identified some as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh Brewery Co.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX>, whose subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> was advertising its Discovery credit card. The officials asked that they not be identified.
The special, broadcast over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting channel WTBS</ENAMEX>, which is seen on cable systems nationwide, will be repeated three times during the week as are all other programs in the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World of Audubon</ENAMEX>'' series.
The program dealt with the cutting down of trees in the old growth forests in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> states, specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>. The logging industry and environmentalists have been arguing over the logging in such forests, which are the natural habitats of the northern spotted owl.
``Due to concerted and apparently organized pressure from the timber industry,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> said in a statement, ``many of the advertisers scheduled for the {special} canceled their commercials for the time period.''
Spokesmen for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> confirmed their companies had withdrawn commercials.
``I think it's outrageous,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter A.A. Berle</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Audubon Society</ENAMEX>. ``The notion that a bunch of people would keep a documentary off the air and keep an issue away from the public is against everything America stands for in terms of free speech and the open exchange of ideas.''
One group of loggers that organized what it called a grass-roots boycott said it was ``pleased'' with the results. ``I'll take some credit,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William N. Grannell</ENAMEX>, executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western States Public Land Coalition</ENAMEX>, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pueblo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo</ENAMEX>. ``Our people got the word out and told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh</ENAMEX>'s beer that if they sponsored such a program, well, our members would not be so inclined to drink <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stroh</ENAMEX>'s beer any longer. I'm just glad these companies became sensitive to our side of the issue.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grannell</ENAMEX> dismissed the argument that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audubon Society</ENAMEX> said it produced a ``balanced'' documentary. ``I'll reserve judgment on that,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grannell</ENAMEX> said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berle</ENAMEX> said the program interviewed loggers and presented their point of view, although, he added, ``the script does have a pro-environmental attitude.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berle</ENAMEX> also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stroh</ENAMEX> had decided to withdraw its sponsorship of the entire ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World of Audubon</ENAMEX>'' series, which consists of four specials annually. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh</ENAMEX>, which couldn't be reached for comment, contributed $100,000 annually to the projects.
There is, of course, nothing new in special-interest groups threatening to boycott advertisers they believe sponsor controversial shows. For instance, conservative religious organizations called for a boycott of companies sponsoring ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roe V. Wade</ENAMEX>,'' a made-for-television movie on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s landmark ruling legalizing abortion.
``But this is not that controversial,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berle</ENAMEX>. ``It is, however, on the front burner out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>.
