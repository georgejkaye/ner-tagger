<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB Corp.</ENAMEX> projected strong earnings in 1989 and 1990 because of continued growth in its banking operations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.
The forecast came amid calls by banking executives in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX> to eliminate legal barriers to nationwide interstate banking in the wake of the $4.7 billion merger accord between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citizens & Southern Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sovran Financial Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh L. Mccoll</ENAMEX>, said he is comfortable with widely shared estimates on Wall Street of $4.25 a share in net income in 1989 and $6 a share in
News of the projections helped nudge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX>'s stock price to $52.50, up 87.5 cents, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday.
``The rules of banking are changing, and we plan to be in a position to compete,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccoll</ENAMEX> told investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>. ``That's why I'm comfortable with Wall Street estimates. In fact, if there are to be any changes {in the estimates}, it will likely be on the up side.''
In 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> had net income of $252.5 million, or $2.90 a share.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccoll</ENAMEX> attributed the strong outlook to continued growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NCNB</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeastern</ENAMEX> banking operations and the contribution from the recent acquisition of the remaining 51% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB Texas National Bank</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> operation, he said, is expected to earn about $250 million this year.
In response to a question, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccoll</ENAMEX> said he agreed with earlier statements by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett A. Brown</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citizens & Southern</ENAMEX>, that the barriers erected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeast Regional Banking Compact</ENAMEX> should be removed. That compact, established in 1985, protects banks in 11 Southeast states from acquisition by banks in other regions. Now, some Southeast bankers say restrictions in the compact handcuff them from acquiring banks elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and strengthening their own hands.
``It's just not logical for us to imprison ourselves,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccoll</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John G. Medlin</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Wachovia Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Winston-Salem</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, said he wouldn't object to eliminating the compact, as long as it was a ``unanimous'' decision. But he added: ``Current differences of opinions among the {compact's} banks and various states mean it will be slow in coming about.
