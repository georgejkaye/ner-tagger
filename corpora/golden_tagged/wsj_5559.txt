<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitro S.A.</ENAMEX> rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor Glass Container Corp.</ENAMEX>'s offer to provide it with confidential financial information if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitro</ENAMEX> agreed to certain conditions.
In a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>'s board yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX> rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>'s terms and reiterated its position that its $20-a-share offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX> is ``full and fair.'' Based on 13.9 million common shares outstanding, the offer values <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, glass container maker, at $278 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX>, a holding company, dismissed as baseless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>'s concern that it would use the confidential information against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>'s refusal to agree not to accept any future offer of less than $20 a share suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX> was trying to arrange a transaction in which its shareholders ``would receive a substantial amount of highly speculative securities.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitro</ENAMEX> said it suspected such a transaction would include ``breakup fees'' intended to penalize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX>.
On Monday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX> sent a letter saying it would provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX> with the confidential data it is providing to other interested parties if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitro</ENAMEX> agreed not to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX> securities except under a tender offer for $20 or more a share.
``We are absolutely certain that the confidential information would not in any way justify lowering the price of your offer,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>'s letter said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX> had refused to sign a confidential agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX> because it didn't want to agree not to lower its $20-a-share offer.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX> closed at $19.25, unchanged.
