The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has completed negotiations on extending bilateral agreements to limit steel imports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> until March 31, 1992, according to the office of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Trade Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX>.
Neither of these <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern European</ENAMEX> nations is a major exporter of steel products to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> A Hills aide said details of the agreements will be made public later.
U.S. trade officials couldn't predict how soon negotiations will be completed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and other major steel-exporting countries. For nearly three months, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has been involved in separate negotiations with steel exporters, seeking a 2 1/2 year renewal of the bilateral ``voluntary restraint agreements'' that have limited steel imports.
The current steel agreements are to expire at the end of next week. But U.S. officials said that if negotiations aren't completed by then, the new agreements could be made retroactive to Oct. 1, thus continuing U.S. efforts to limit steel imports to roughly an 18.4% share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market.
