The beleaguered West German retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co op AG</ENAMEX> will close about 10% of its stores by the end of this year, a company official said.
The retailer, recently saved from the brink of bankruptcy by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank</ENAMEX>, is trying to restructure to shed some debt and cut costs.
The official, workers' council chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Haselhoff</ENAMEX>, said the planned closure of 207 stores will affect about 2,500 employees for whom the company has prepared a comprehensive benefit plan.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haselhoff</ENAMEX> said the company, in addition to revamping its financial and employee structure, also has to move on its pricing policy. ``Many customers say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co op</ENAMEX> is simply too expensive,'' he said.
