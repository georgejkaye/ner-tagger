Thanks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittle Communications</ENAMEX>, advertisers have already infiltrated the classroom and the doctor's waiting room. Apparently, that isn't enough.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX>'s latest plan is to create a massive national promotion around its Special Reports, a series of free magazines found only in doctors' offices. The promotion, which the media company discussed late last week, will take advertiser tie-ins to extremes -- becoming perhaps the brashest, most blatant attempt yet by a magazine to custom-make a demographically correct audience for its advertisers. And it's coming, for six months in 1991, to a shopping mall near you.
The new promotion will revolve around a Special Reports series, ``Families of the World,'' profiling family life in different cultures. It will call into play virtually every marketing tie-in known to man: an elaborate mall exhibit, sponsored by local retailers and Special Reports advertisers, reinforced by product sampling, and beefed up by a national sweepstakes and local contests. It might include distributing Special Reports to schools nationwide, an international marketing conference and a network television special. And that's just for starters.
The traveling show is the latest in a string of increasingly elaborate promotions, the biggest being the TV show\ tie-ins between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> going on now. It is also shrewdly timed: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittle</ENAMEX> is currently negotiating with advertisers to extend their two-year ad contracts with Special Reports, and wants to hold out the prospect of additional bells and whistles.
In an interview, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenberg</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX>, stresses -- over and over again -- that this is a ``journalistic idea'' that came out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX>'s editorial side. The concept had nothing to do with advertising, honest.
But the Special Report series, which will be published at the same time the mall show is on, so far hasn't chosen the ``five renowned international editors'' that a video describing the project promises. Its ``international board of advisers,'' made up of sociologists, anthropologists and others, hasn't yet been assembled. The ``30 top foreign correspondents'' haven't yet been hired. Only some mock magazine covers -- ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>,'' ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>,'' and so on for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> -- have been produced.
On the other hand, the advertising side of the enterprise is in full swing. Over the past two weeks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> has quietly made a slick video presentation to all of the dozen advertisers currently in Special Reports, as well as to all of those advertisers' ad agencies. And the advertisers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> says, are quite interested.
``It has the potential to add some top spin to the basic magazine concept,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich Hamilton</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles</ENAMEX>, whose clients include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> advertiser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>. He says he needs more details -- prices, for example, haven't yet been worked out -- but ``the concept is very timely and provocative.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Bellows</ENAMEX>, Special Reports editor, dismisses as ``baloney'' the suggestion that the project is designed for advertisers. ``It's an editorial idea, and a very expensive one,'' he says. Potential writers, editors and advisers are all being contacted now, he says, and aren't in place yet simply because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> is still researching which areas of the world and what types of subjects to write about.
``Our goal is to become a great general-interest family magazine,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellows</ENAMEX> adds. He says he wants the six special issues of Special Report to ``capture the atmosphere of family life... the traditions, the rituals, the folklore.'' The promotional video, with characteristic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> brassiness, dubs the Special Reports families series ``one of the most ambitious and revealing productions of our time,'' as well as ``the publishing event of the coming decade.''
What it certainly is, is a marketing event of gargantuan proportions. It starts with the mall exhibit, basically a walk-through version of the magazine that will travel to about a third of the 600 major malls in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Sharing prime exhibit space, of course, will be Special Reports advertisers: ``Tide might show Tide boxes from 40 countries, with a slogan like'Tide cleans the world,''' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> suggests.
People going through the exhibit will also be given samples and coupons for the advertisers involved. And by entering a sweepstakes to win a big prize, perhaps a trip around the world, they'll unwittingly help Whittle assemble a huge mailing list and research pool. When permitted by the malls, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittle</ENAMEX> staffers will also be on hand to sell Special Reports copies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> also plans to sign up the major newspaper, television stations and radio station in each market. They in turn will be encouraged to create their own local promotions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> hopes newspapers, for example, will agree to buy up enough copies of the ``Families of the World'' Special Reports to distribute to all the local schoolchildren in its area.
With the promotion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> also hopes to take advantage, for the first time, of its tie with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>, which last year bought 50% of the company. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittle</ENAMEX> will likely talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> or its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> unit about jointly creating a ``Families of the World'' TV documentary. It may also consult with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> ``down the road'' about selling subscriptions to its Special Reports series, which now is free, he says.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> has even bigger plans: the rest of the world. ``We haven't explored that to any great extent,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> says, but adds that the series' global theme might open up distribution possibilities for both the magazines and a TV show abroad. Special Reports advertisers, naturally, would get first dibs.
