To American advertising people, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert Gross</ENAMEX> is the man who invented ``the French disease.''
For years, established agencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> derided Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> as a bargain-basement ad man who ruined client relationships. They did all they could to stop him. They failed. Now the French disease is spreading to other European countries and, some believe, will eventually reach the U.S.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX>'s idea is based on simple economics. By buying huge quantities of ad space from newspapers, magazines, television and radio, he reasoned, he could demand discounts as high as 50%. Then he could resell the space to clients in customized cut-rate packages -- and still make a huge profit.
Over the past 20 years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX>'s success has been phenomenal. Today, associates and industry insiders say, he controls 25% of the space and time sold in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and, through affiliates, more than 10% of the advertising market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>.
``Media-buying is becoming the creative frontier of advertising,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Scott</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS Group PLC</ENAMEX>, which is helping Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> extend his influence through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. ``There is going to be a battleground in the marketplace.''
For the moment, media-buying hasn't reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, partly because lawyers here believe some of its forms may constitute price-fixing. But U.S. agencies have banded together to form media-buying groups abroad, and some insiders believe the practice may ultimately spread to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
This year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnicom Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, together with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group PLC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Walter Thompson Co.</ENAMEX>, joined together to form <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Partnership</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic Group of Cos.</ENAMEX> has allied with the media-buying affiliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publicis SA</ENAMEX>. British firms, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi PLC</ENAMEX>, have created their own media-buying companies and alliances, and more are in the works.
Fighting to stay ahead, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> now is negotiating the acquisition of his company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat Holding SA</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>, which already owns 50% of the company. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX>, his brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> and a few other associates would become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>'s largest shareholders -- eventually acquiring as much as 29.9% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> brothers would also join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> board.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>, in turn, is planning to sell a majority of its ad-agency business -- which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina Mcnamee</ENAMEX> WCRS -- to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX>, a move that would allow it to concentrate on the media-buying business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>'s discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> may be concluded by late this week and would result in Eurocom raising its 20% stake in the ad business to 60% to 70%, say executives close to the discussions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carat</ENAMEX> says that following its alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> in April 1988, its European business has exploded. This year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> officials expect their subsidiaries' and affiliates' bookings in five European countries outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> to quintuple to more than 11 billion francs ($1.7 billion) -- surpassing for the first time their total business within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX>, who is publicity-shy, wasn't available to be interviewed for this story, and closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> won't disclose profits. But trade publications claim his gross profit margins approach 10%, well above the industry norm. ``We have made all our acquisitions without having to use outside funding,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Hochman</ENAMEX>, who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat International.</ENAMEX> ``You can say that we make a good living.''
But when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> started in 1969, he had to form his own company; the established players refused to back him. Ad agencies were accustomed to buying media space themselves, customer by customer. They wanted to keep the business. They warned customers that the bargain-priced air time and magazine space would be second-class -- the leavings that couldn't be sold at normal prices. And they said a go-between like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> could ruin the secrecy of planned ad campaigns.
``The idea was controversial for a long time, because clients and agencies were worried about strategic leaks,'' explains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-based European vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccann-Erickson</ENAMEX>.
But many high-volume advertisers -- notably retail stores and food companies -- were willing to take the risk to cut prices. Eventually, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX>'s volume and discounts won out. Even prestige clients decided that as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> kept secret the contents of their planned campaigns, they could buy their time more cheaply through him and get the same media slots delivered by their agencies. ``The agencies are like big hospitals: They treat all patients,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hochman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carat</ENAMEX>. ``We are like surgeons who only treat injuries of the finger.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX>, for example, still uses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccann-Erickson</ENAMEX> to design ad campaigns, but it now hires Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> to buy French ad space and time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carat</ENAMEX> says its 1,200 other customers include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S.p. A.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSN SA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX>
As his volume grew, newspapers, magazines and radio and TV stations began coming to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX>, begging him to include them in his packages and offering top display at even better discounts. The process shook the world's ad agencies. Beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, the biggest threw in the towel and created their own bulk-buying groups.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX>'s planned merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> comes as the bulk-buying boom seems to be taking off in other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. With the deregulation of radio and television, there has been a proliferation of new stations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>. They need advertisers, and the bulk buyers are ready. Led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX>, bulk buyers now have one-quarter of the Spanish ad market, and 15% in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>.
Moreover, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> says the growth of powerful, internationally expanding media groups -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlusconi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bertelsmann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell Communication</ENAMEX> -- means that media buyers also must be big and international. ``The development of these all-powerful media groups is a trend that is going to put massive power in their hands, against the advertisers {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX>'s clients},'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>. ``That force has to be met with force.''
When will this business get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>? ``Our ambitions go well beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hochman</ENAMEX>. But he doesn't have any immediate plans to move into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> And for now, U.S. ad people say, American customers remain leery of dealing with anything but individual ad agencies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> networks forbid customers from reselling air time after they have bought it. But some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> officials speculate that, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> networks suffer financial problems, even they might be lured by the idea of large-scale ad sales through middlemen like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit City</ENAMEX> Account
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit City</ENAMEX>, a giant consumer electronics specialty retailer, awarded its $25 million account to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Jones</ENAMEX>, the company's vice president of advertising, said a decision hadn't yet been reached, but people close to the review said the account had been awarded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX> unit. The account had previously been handled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Admarketing</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> agency, but the two agreed to part when there was a difference in the direction of the advertising, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said yesterday.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, retailer, which has more than 120 stores nationwide, began the search earlier this year and initially considered 16 agencies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit City</ENAMEX> finally narrowed the search to just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>, both of which completed extensive creative speculative work for the pitch.
Ad Notes....
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC STUDY</ENAMEX>: In the latest example of a network aiming to demonstrate that more people watch TV than Nielsen ratings suggest, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> unit yesterday released a study showing TV reaches at least 96% of all college students during a typical school week. Some TV executives say the college market is underreported because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nielsen Television</ENAMEX> Index counts only in-home audiences, not dormitories on campuses. In its study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> found that daytime serials reach nearly 47% of all students; late-night entertainment programming reaches more than 49% of all students.
WHO'S  NEWS: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Harty</ENAMEX>, 37 years old, was named general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather New York</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harty</ENAMEX> succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Caffrey</ENAMEX>, 51, who will devote full time to his continuing responsibilities as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O*/NNP&M</ENAMEX>'s world-wide media director.
