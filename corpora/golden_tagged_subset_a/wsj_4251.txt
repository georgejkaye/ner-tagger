The Bush administration is beginning to consider new steps to aid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, including naming a special coordinator for Polish assistance and sending over teams of economic experts, a senior official said.
Consideration of additional steps to aid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> has been prompted by two developments, the official said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> aides are pleased with meetings they held this week with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s new, non-Communist foreign and finance ministers, who presented their plans for economic change. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has insisted that additional U.S. aid should come only after changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s socialist economic system are under way.
Secondly, the administration has concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is determined to vote more aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> than the $100 million in food assistance President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has requested, so officials want to lay plans to spend additional aid wisely.
The new special coordinator for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> would be a presidential ``point man'' charged with ensuring that steps taken within the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government to help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> are being coordinated. The experts sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> would, among other things, advise the Poles on how to formulate new economic plans that would meet the approval of the International Monetary Fund.
