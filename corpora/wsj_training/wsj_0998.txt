Office Market Weakens
In Overbuilt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORTHEAST</ENAMEX> office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of the 1980s.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreclosures</ENAMEX> and other signs of financial distress, most often associated with the real estate market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>.
Some projects are now in the hands of lenders, including a 425,000-square-foot office facility in Little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falls</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX> The owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in King of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prussia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, have advertised for new financing. Rising office vacancy rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairfield County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, have builders and bankers scrambling to restructure loans. And in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, developers are bracing for cutbacks in the computer industry, a major user of office space.
Many troubled properties haven't been foreclosed on and are hard to identify, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert I. Berger</ENAMEX>, who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Secaucus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, office of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helmsley-Spear Inc.</ENAMEX>, a real estate brokerage. Owners are voluntarily -- and quietly -- turning over properties to lenders through ``deeds in lieu of foreclosure.'' Often, developers stay on as property manager.
Real estate analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Lynford</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>'s distress is masked by relatively low vacancy rates. But in today's overbuilt market, tenants have many choices and are negotiating low rents that squeeze building owners. On average, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynford</ENAMEX> says, it now takes three to 3 1/2 years to fill new office space, compared with 2 1/2 years in 1988.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> Comes
To Suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>
WHY SHOULD the Japanese cross the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> to buy American real estate when they can simply recreate it at home?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyu Development Corp.</ENAMEX> is spending $500 million to build American-style luxury homes in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> with rarely seen back yards, front yards, swimming pools and tennis courts.
The Japanese company hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson Nagy Martin</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newport Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, architectural firm, to design what the Japanese press has dubbed ``the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.'' Instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks, the new ``One <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hundred Hills</ENAMEX>'' development will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots. That's more than 10 times the usual housing site size.
Buyers with $6 million to spend can select from 11 designs, including a Mediterranean-inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> style, a traditional Yankee look and designs inspired by Midwestern architect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX>. There are spacious living rooms and baths, plus a master grandparents suite and a foyer for removing shoes to suit Japanese life styles.
Exteriors are faced with brick, wood or stone, but the homes are made of steel-reinforced concrete. ``We were disappointed we couldn't use wood,'' says architect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter J. Richardson</ENAMEX>, ``but the Japanese only want stronger materials.'' At $1,000 per square foot, the Japanese want the feeling of indestructibility, he explains, not to mention protection from possible earthquake damage.
Housing Developers Try
Brand-Name Buildings
RESIDENTIAL builders, faced with a more competitive market, are turning to a traditional consumer marketing technique to establish brand-name identity.
``One of the difficulties people in real estate have is that each product is like starting a new company, or starting a new line in the fashion business,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Robert Lieb</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mountain Development Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Paterson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX> So he's using ``river'' in many project names. ``It'll never be like what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bristol-Myers</ENAMEX> does,'' he adds, ``but it helps establish recognition with the public -- and with banks.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weingarten-Siegel Group Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manalapan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, has built <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross Creek</ENAMEX> Pointe, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allegro Pointe</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pointes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caspi Development Corp of Armonk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, has developed two apartment buildings called Classic and plans a third. Developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Caspi</ENAMEX> says the same brand name indicates consistent quality, ``regardless of location, design or amenities.''
The leader in real estate brand names is developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ara Hovnanian</ENAMEX>. His entry-price condos are labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society Hill</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beacon Hill</ENAMEX> is for ``move-up'' town houses, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nob Hill</ENAMEX>, for single-family houses. Because of standardized designs, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hovnanian</ENAMEX> says, ``a buyer can visualize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Society Hill</ENAMEX> regardless of where it is.''
Quake Not Likely to Jolt
The Commercial Market
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EARTHQUAKE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> has sent few tremors through the hearts of real estate investors.
``I think there's a disease called buyer 's regret, and I'm sure it's running rampant at this moment, but it gets cured in a short period of time,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Leventhal</ENAMEX>, co-managing partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenneth Leventhal & Co</ENAMEX>,. a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> accounting firm specializing in real estate. ``If I were buying a building in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> now the first thing I'd do is insist on a structural inspection, then I'd delay a little, stall a little.''
But like other real estate professionals accustomed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s quake risks, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leventhal</ENAMEX> anticipates little long-term change in the city's commercial real estate market.
Still, local builders are eager to tell the world that most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> doesn't look like the TV images of destruction. Planners of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Land Institute</ENAMEX> real estate conference this week hastily added a panel on the quake's effects. ``The message is we build'em build'em right,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Bedford</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> developer and officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Land Institute</ENAMEX>. ``There's seven million square feet of space that's doing great.
