An investment company said it offered to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby's Inc.</ENAMEX>, the fast-food operator, for $205 million.
The proposal, however, was immediately rebuffed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWG Corp.</ENAMEX> ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s isn't for sale,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renee Mottram</ENAMEX>, senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWG</ENAMEX>.
The new suitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stevric Equity Ventures Inc.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mineola</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, characterized its proposal as the ``first truly independent offer which does not pit one interest group against another within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s franchisee community.''
In September, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DWG</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, holding company controlled by financeer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Posner</ENAMEX>, rejected an offer from a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s franchisees to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s for $200 million. Since then, a second group of franchisees has banded together to try to wrestle control of the unit from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Posner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s is the marketing, franchising and service company for the 2,100 restaurants in the chain.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stevric</ENAMEX>'s principals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Buckley</ENAMEX>, said they led the acquisition group that acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan's Famous Inc.</ENAMEX> restaurant chain and subsequently served as the top officers of the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Buckley</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stevric</ENAMEX>'s acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s ``would allow seasoned franchisers and food-service operators, with no conflicts of interest, to stabilize franchisee relations and properly refocus the company's energies toward growth.
