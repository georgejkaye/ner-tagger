Something funny is happening to the gold stocks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake Mining</ENAMEX> in particular.
With the price of gold not far above its recent three-year low, shares of gold producers could easily be in the doldrums. Yet they're up about 10% this month. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX>, the second largest U.S. gold-mining company, has shown puny earnings lately, yet it rose to a series of new 52-week highs last week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX> advanced 1 1/4 points for the week to 16 3/8. Daily volume, which averaged only 250,000 shares last month, exceeded 700,000 shares both last Wednesday and Friday.
Yesterday, while most stocks declined, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX> rose another 1/4 to 16 5/8, on volume of more than 900,000 shares.
The price of gold, which hit a three-year intraday low of $356 an ounce on Sept. 15, has bounced back 3.5%. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX>, long regarded as a high-cost producer, is making progress in narrowing the production-cost gap between it and its major rivals.
But skeptics say those are frail reeds on which to build an investment. Mining company shares, they say, are already priced to anticipate $400-an-ounce gold. So anyone betting on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Homestake</ENAMEX>, or several other gold producers whose shares have edged up recently, had better be anticipating prices even higher than that.
Besides, they say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX> is still a high-cost producer, just less so than before. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tumazos</ENAMEX>, precious metals analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ENAMEX>, points out that the cost gap has closed mainly because rivals' costs have risen, not because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX>'s costs have come way down.
In talks with analysts touring two of its mines earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX> said it is producing gold at a cost (on a ``cash basis,'' which doesn't include depreciation and some other items) of $260 an ounce.
``That certainly is a positive development,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vahid Fathi</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prescott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ball & Turben</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, who considers Homestake a buy. He had previously been estimating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX>'s production cost at $275 an ounce.
Even so, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fathi</ENAMEX> says, rivals can produce gold more cheaply. The lowest-cost producer among the big five North American gold mining companies, he figures, is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newmont Gold</ENAMEX>, at $220 an ounce (cash basis). Then comes Echo Bay Mines at $235, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placer</ENAMEX> Dome at $245 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Barrick Resources</ENAMEX> at $250. Some smaller competitors have costs below $200 an ounce.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX> is ``a stock that many people criticized, from the mid-1980s until now, as a high-cost producer and a slow grower,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy P. Gassman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> analyst. She thinks the company is making progress, and calls it ``attractive long term.''
But skeptics object that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX> is selling for 20 times the consensus estimate of next year's earnings, and 35 times this year's probable earnings. By contrast, stocks in general are selling for about 13 times this year's expected earnings.
``The major North American gold companies are trading at about 30 times {estimated} 1990 earnings at $400 gold,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tumazos</ENAMEX>. ``While I expect gold to rebound to $400 next year, I don't think the stocks have a particularly large upside.''
Rivals such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echo Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Barrick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newmont Gold</ENAMEX> made big discoveries in 1987, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tumazos</ENAMEX> says, and can afford to cut back considerably on exploration if they wish. He gives those stocks a neutral rating. Meanwhile, he says, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX> is spending about $35 million (or about $35 per ounce of gold it produces) on exploration and can't cut back without undermining investor confidence. He rates it ``unattractive.''
For people who want gold shares, ``there are better stocks to own,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Toufexis</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert.</ENAMEX> He likes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freeport Mcmoran</ENAMEX> Gold, Battle Mountain Gold, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMC Gold</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pegasus Gold.</ENAMEX>
But if the price of gold rises well above $400 an ounce, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toufexis</ENAMEX> notes, shares of high-cost producers like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake</ENAMEX> would benefit the most: Their profit margins would surge. For that reason, he says, sophisticated gold-share investors sometimes hold a mixture of three low-cost producers and one high-cost producer.
Still there. Yesterday's edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Week</ENAMEX>, an industry newsletter, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Connolly</ENAMEX>, chief strategist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds</ENAMEX>, had resigned. That was news to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connolly</ENAMEX>, whose authority as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> spokesman actually was strengthened by the recent departure of veteran strategist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mendelson</ENAMEX>. ``I'll have to call {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Week</ENAMEX>} and find out where I went,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connolly</ENAMEX> quipped.
