Along with food, credit and new technology, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> is homing in on something else it badly wants from the West: accountants.
On a three-day visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> this week, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Janizsewski</ENAMEX>, vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s foreign-investment agency, is focusing on the accounting profession almost exclusively. He has called on executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst & Young</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers & Lybrand</ENAMEX>, Price <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waterhouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touche Ross & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Andersen & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peat Marwick Mcclintock</ENAMEX>. Already, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore Stephens</ENAMEX>, an international accounting firm based here, is setting up two operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>.
The spectacle of so many accountants rushing in where Communist apparatchiks have been shooed away is easily explained. The number-crunchers are needed to price the entire economy, which has been long removed from the forces that normally determine what things really cost or what people would pay to own them.
``We need a genuine mechanism of supply and demand that we don't have,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janizsewski</ENAMEX> says. ``The cost element in a managed economy was neglected.''
Among other things, the accountants are sharpening their pencils to go through stacks of records of state-run ministries that the Solidarity-led government plans to sell someday as part of a sweeping privatization campaign. Officials say such records carry much about central plans and little about actual costs or consumer desires.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Andersen</ENAMEX> is plowing through the books for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lenin Shipyard</ENAMEX>, already slated for privatization. ``I'm convinced that at least two others {accounting firms} will get involved,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janizsewski</ENAMEX> says.
The Polish government's asset sales may generate more foreign investment than joint ventures between Western companies and local partners, he says. ``The largest opportunities aren't necessarily gaining joint ventures -- which are entirely new companies -- but enabling foreign investors to buy shares in existing business.''
Even before the accountants arrive in force, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janizsewski</ENAMEX> concedes that the job of selling shares in Polish enterprises is hampered by the absence of an exchange to trade the shares on. An exchange will be set up next year, he adds, and in the meantime, some Polish shares could be listed on other countries' exchanges.
While vigorously promoting investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janizsewski</ENAMEX> fears there may be some resistance at home when the investment bankers begin flocking in. ``For 45 years, the capitalist was pictured as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> sucking the blood of the worker,'' he says. ``What we need is a PR campaign explaining about privatization.''
In addition to helping various state-run enterprises go private, the accounting firms will likely offer training, management consulting and general advice. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore Stephens</ENAMEX>, the first firm to set up an auditing operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>, also has established a firm there called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Consulting.</ENAMEX> The firm offers advice to Polish companies wanting to link up with Western operations, and to Western businesses seeking partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>.
``We decided to focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> because commercial law there has changed very substantially,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jervase Hulbert</ENAMEX>, chairman of the firm. ``You can today have a 100% Western-owned company operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore Stephens</ENAMEX>'s two firms, however, involve minority holdings by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Accountants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>.
So far this year, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janizsewski</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> has approved about 450 joint ventures with Western companies. He estimates that by year end, that number will rise to 800. Of the 450 ventures approved already, 200 involve West German companies. The next largest batch, about 40, comes from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX> having gained approvals for about 35 each.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern bloc</ENAMEX>'s drive for an economic transfusion from the West will figure prominently in discussions of world financial leaders gathering this weekend in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> for the annual meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>, as well as a gathering of the Group of Seven major industrial nations.
``The new subject on which there will certainly be a great deal of discussion is what is happening in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> in particular,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s chancellor of the exchequer, told reporters. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> is drawing up a sweeping package of economic changes for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> but added that even before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> completes this work, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> would be willing to reschedule part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s foreign debt.
