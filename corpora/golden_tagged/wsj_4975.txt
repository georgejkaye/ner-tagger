<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Healthcare Management Inc.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John A. Bradley</ENAMEX>, its chairman and chief executive officer, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David A. Huff</ENAMEX>, its vice chairman and president, resigned effective Sept. 8.
The hospital management concern said the resignations were part of its internal reorganization plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Healthcare</ENAMEX> is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, which protects a company from creditors while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts. But the company's first plan -- under which it would have been bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bain Capital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> Capital Markets -- collapsed a few weeks ago when operating results continued to deteriorate.
That left the internal reorganization plan, which a company spokesman said has been approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Healthcare</ENAMEX> debt holders and is scheduled for a court confirmation hearing Oct. 3. The plan meant replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huff</ENAMEX>, who are two of the company's three founders. (The third founder left several years ago.)
``In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, when you buy a football team or a company, you get to pick your own coach,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley</ENAMEX>. His plans, he added, are ``to go fishin'.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Healthcare</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, has appointed its chief financial officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark L. Plaumann</ENAMEX>, as acting president while it searches for a new chief executive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Healthcare</ENAMEX> finished the second quarter with a 70% drop in net income to $1.4 million from $4.6 million the year earlier. The company owns or leases 18 hospitals in 10 states.
