Shareholder suits were filed against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX>' proposed acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> for stock valued at $18.75 a share, or about $730 million.
The suits, which seek to block the acquisition, allege that in accepting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX>' offer Monday, directors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> ``left on the table'' a higher offer from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian Bancorp</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> emerged last Friday as a bidder for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Reading</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> in play. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> first offered stock valued at $18 a share for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> bank. During a weekend of negotiations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> raised its bid, offering stock valued at about $20.85 a share.
The suits claim <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and its directors ``rushed to sign the agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates.</ENAMEX>'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> sweetened its bid to $18.75 share, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> accepted, during the weekend talks.
The suits also seek to block a ``lockup option'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> granted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX>, which would allow Corestates to purchase 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s stock at $15.25 a share under certain conditions.
As many as 19 shareholder suits were consolidated into one complaint which was filed late Tuesday in the Court of Common Pleas in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. Three of the suits were assembled late last month after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> announced its bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>. A lawyer representing some of the shareholders said there was concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> might not openly consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> offer and not respond to it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> officials still hadn't seen a copy of the suit late yesterday. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Butler</ENAMEX>, the bank's vice chairman, said the company's policy is to not comment on matters under litigation. Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> said, ``We believe the suit has no merit, and will be vigorously defended.''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> closed at $16.625 a share, up 12.5 cents. In national over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> was unchanged at $46.75 a share.
