It declined to estimate the loss.
It was the second consecutive quarter of bad news for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEEQ</ENAMEX>, which previously reported that profit slumped 31% in its fiscal third quarter. At the time, the semiconductor maker blamed increased marketing and research expenses.
In national over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEEQ</ENAMEX> closed at $4.125, up 6.25 cents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEEQ</ENAMEX> said most fourth-quarter problems stem from slumping sales of its Ethernet chip sets, arrays of semiconductors that help large networks of computers to communicate. However, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEEQ</ENAMEX> spokesman characterized the downturn in those orders as a ``short-term phenomenon,'' saying September bookings improved sharply over orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX>.
