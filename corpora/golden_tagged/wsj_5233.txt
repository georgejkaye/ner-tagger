Assets of 466 money-market mutual funds rose $1.3 billion in the week ended Wednesday, to $348.98 billion, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment Company Institute</ENAMEX> reported.
``At the present level of assets and yields, over $400 million a week comes just from the interest credited by funds to individual accounts,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Dreyer</ENAMEX>, vice president and chief economist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>-based trade group. ``New money is evidently attracted by stable money-market fund yields and their substantial positive spread over competing instruments.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donoghue's Money Fund Report</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Holliston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, newsletter that tracks fewer funds, earlier this week reported a $2.2 billion increase in assets, to $341.7 billion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donoghue's</ENAMEX> attributed the inflow in part to transfers out of junk bond funds following turmoil in the high-risk, high-yield market late last week.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donoghue's</ENAMEX>, the funds it tracks had an average seven-day compound yield, which reflects reinvestment of dividends, of 8.60% in the week ended Tuesday. That compares to a 7.90% yield on three-month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold at Monday's auction, for example.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment Company Institute</ENAMEX> said assets of 141 institutional funds fell by $645.4 million to $84.21 billion in the latest week. Assets of 230 general purpose funds grew by $1.13 billion to $113.21 billion and the 95 broker-dealer funds increased assets by $815.8 million to $151.56 billion.
