As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> brothers' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco S.A.</ENAMEX> has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> oil men. But the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in September 1988.
The Peruvian mineral concern's $251 million claim stems from 1988 jury award in a case stemming from the brothers' alleged attempts to corner the 1979-80 silver market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> now says it is willing to settle for up to $65.7 million from each brother, although the actual amount would probably be much less.
Although the proposal must be approved by federal Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold C. Abramson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern's proposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> is considering it, although his attorney says he won't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX>, which claims the brothers owe $1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases.
The tentative agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt</ENAMEX> is awaiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> approval. Under it, the former billionaire's assets would be liquidated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> getting 80% of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX>, which is seeking repayment of a $36 million loan.
A similiar proposal has been made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> case although he and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings.
In both cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie. With support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> has filed suit asking Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX> to subordinate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX>'s claim to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturer Hanover</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> has threatened a ``volcano'' of litigation if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> unit attempts to force such a plan through the court.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> said it wouldn't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> case is approved by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX>, who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minpeco</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Gorman</ENAMEX> decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Herbert Hunt</ENAMEX> case but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Ray</ENAMEX>, attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX>, called it ``silly'' and said he would fight it in court.
``The thing is so fluid right now that there's really no way to say what will happen,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grover Hartt III</ENAMEX>, who represents the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> in the case. ``Developments like this are hard to predict.
