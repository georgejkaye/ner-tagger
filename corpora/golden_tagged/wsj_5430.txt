<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association</ENAMEX>, a major institutional investor, has agreed to buy 17 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">State Street</ENAMEX>, a new office tower on the tip of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>.
The 42-story building was completed in 1988 by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William Kaufman Organization Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> real-estate development concern, and is about 20% occupied. Terms weren't disclosed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kaufman</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufman Organization</ENAMEX>, said that the nationwide teachers pension fund held a mortgage on the property exceeding $140 million and that the purchase price was ``substantially above the mortgage.''
Using a market rate of about $300 a square foot for new commercial office properties in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, the 525,000-square-foot tower would sell for upwards of $157.5 million.
Both parties emphasized that the sale was not, in effect, a foreclosure. The building has had trouble attracting tenants willing to pay its relatively high rents. The vacancies could have dragged down the purchase price, but the building is considered a high-quality structure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JMB Realty Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, was a partner in the project until February when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaufman</ENAMEX> bought its stake for a price that wasn't disclosed.
