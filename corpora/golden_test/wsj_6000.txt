Canadian manufacturers operated at 82.2% of capacity in the second quarter, down from 82.7% in the first quarter, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
It was the third consecutive quarterly decline in the capacity utilization rate.
Statistics Canada attributed the decline partly to ``exceptional growth'' in productive capacity as a result of plant expansions.
