<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco Inc.</ENAMEX> agreed to move its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> headquarters to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canary Wharf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX>'s huge office project in the derelict dockyards of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East London</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">White Plains</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, oil giant is only the second tenant to agree to take space in the $7 billion, 71-acre development since the closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based real estate concern bought it in 1987. In March, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> agreed to move its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> headquarters there when the project's first phase is completed in 1991.
Two other companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.</ENAMEX>, were part of a consortium that conceived the project but later sold most of its interest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco</ENAMEX>'s 25-year lease calls for it to move its 850 employees from the elegant Knightsbridge section to a 200,000-square-foot building at the western end of the project. Terms weren't disclosed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> expects to move in mid-1992.
The agreement brings the total office space taken in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canary Wharf</ENAMEX> to 1,440,000 square feet, less than 15% of the 10 million square feet planned. A 400-bedroom hotel, restaurants, shops, parking and recreational facilities are planned to raise the total to 12 million square feet. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York</ENAMEX> says the project could take a decade to complete.
