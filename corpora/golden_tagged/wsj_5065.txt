The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Court</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Justice</ENAMEX> upheld and clarified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX>'s authority to raid corporate offices and search for evidence under its antitrust investigative powers.
In a much-awaited decision, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX>-based court said that companies must cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> antitrust investigators by allowing them to enter buildings and by turning over corporate files. It said the human-rights principle of the inviolability of premises doesn't apply to business offices.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> court reminded the commission that it must respect national legal procedures when carrying out investigations.
The court's decision stemmed from a 1987 case in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst AG</ENAMEX> refused to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> investigators search its main office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> because they didn't have a warrant issued by a West German court. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> officials gained entry two months later after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Cartel Office</ENAMEX> obtained a warrant from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> judge. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> sued the commission before the Court of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, alleging the inviolability of its premises.
The court rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX>'s main argument that the search was illegal. It ruled that if a company refuses to cooperate, national authorities must help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> inspectors carry out an investigation. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, this would entail obtaining a search warrant.
The court said, furthermore, that if the commission anticipates that a target company will refuse to cooperate, investigators can circumvent the company and work with national authorities from the start.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> lost its case, the court did limit the commission's investigative powers. The commission had alleged that it could conduct searches without the assistance of national authorities and without respecting national procedures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> said in a statement that it is happy with court's decision because it underscores the company's view that the commission needed a warrant to search its office. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> probe was part of a five-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>-wide investigation of alleged price-fixing for two common plastics: polivinylchloride and low-density polyethylene. The probe led the commission last December to fine 23 companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX>.
