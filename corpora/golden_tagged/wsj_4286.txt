The early bird gets the worm. But it may also get a lot of heat from the rest of the flock.
Witness the current brawl over a new life-insurance investment pioneered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lansing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX>, uncovered an apparent loophole in a 1988 tax law that stripped some of the investment appeal from so-called single-premium whole life insurance. Eager to capitalize on its discovery, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> developed a policy with the high-tech-sounding name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SPWL II</ENAMEX> and introduced it to the public a few months ago with high hopes for big sales.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> didn't figure on the negative reaction within the insurance industry, where it has been lambasted for ``irresponsible action,'' betrayal and imprudence.
A large association of insurance agents not only criticized the loophole policy to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, it helped shape legislation that has brought sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX>'s new product to a halt. The measure is attached to the tax bill being debated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, and is considered likely to become law if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> adopts a tax package in the coming weeks.
``I don't remember when I have seen such a vehement attack on one company by people in the industry,'' marvels <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph M. Belth</ENAMEX>, an insurance professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana University</ENAMEX>.
What possible reason could the trade group, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Life Underwriters</ENAMEX>, have for running to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX>'s policy?
The greater good of the whole industry, say officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based association.
As they see it, the new policy violates the spirit of the 1988 tax act. And, they say, an angry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> could turn around and attack the key tax benefit of life insurance -- the tax-free growth of the savings component, or ``cash value,'' within whole life policies.
``Anything we do in this industry which has the slightest chance of bringing about an invasion of that tax-free inside buildup is irresponsible,'' says agent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas J. Wolff</ENAMEX>, a past president and active member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NALU</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolff</ENAMEX> has publicly accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> of performing ``a distinct disservice'' to the industry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National adamantly</ENAMEX> denies that its new product violates the spirit of the 1988 act. On the contrary, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William A. Gray</ENAMEX>, a vice president, the policy precisely meets the act's requirements.
He also sees some less-than-altruistic factors behind the trade group's complaints. The association's elected officials are agents for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> mutual insurers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> says. Some of those companies, he asserts, have higher operating costs and are less able to make a profit on newer investment-oriented policies than are some competitors -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX>, for instance.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> contends that's one reason the trade group didn't oppose restrictions on single premium life last year. ``To protect these things aren't necessarily in their best interest,'' he says.
He adds that the group may be smarting because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> criticized its lobbying position last year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubbish</ENAMEX>, says NALU executive vice president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack E. Bobo</ENAMEX>. The suggestion that the trade group has a prejudice against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> is ``100% paranoia on their part,'' he says. In fact, he adds, it could be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> that holds a grudge against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NALU</ENAMEX> for prevailing in last year's congressional battle.
The single-premium life insurance policies at the heart of the current squabble are simply standard cash-value life policies purchased with one lump-sum premium. In recent years, stockbrokers and life-insurance agents have sold billions of dollars of this coverage as an investment-insurance combination.
Some lawmakers have felt the protection element was getting short shrift from buyers and sellers. So, in the 1988 tax act, they knocked out a significant investment appeal of the lump-sum insurance purchases: the ability to borrow money through policy loans without incurring tax.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> says it was able to resurrect that loan feature on its SPWL II through a complex product design that includes insuring two people -- such as a husband and wife -- on the same policy, and reducing the death benefit after the first seven years.
That product design, however, would be invalidated by a provision in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means</ENAMEX> tax bill. The provision was introduced by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Kennelly</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> Democrat who played a major role in drafting last year's restrictions. The new rule would be effective for policies purchased beginning Sept. 14.
Compared with the furor over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> product, sales of the policy have been minimal. The company says it has issued 163 policies with premiums totaling $3 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> says the agents' trade group is responsible for the latest legislation. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NALU</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Congresswoman Kennelly</ENAMEX> and said,'We'We think this is not what you wanted {the 1988 act} to do,''' he says.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobo</ENAMEX> isn't willing to take that much responsibility for the measure -- although the association strongly supports it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NALU</ENAMEX> didn't go ``screaming up to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>'' with an advertisement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> policy in hand, he says. ``We are in and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Congresswoman Kennelly</ENAMEX>'s office on a frequent basis,'' talking about industry developments. ``My sense is even if we did bring it up, the office was already aware of it.''
An administrative aide to Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennelly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J. Prucker</ENAMEX>, first said the impetus for the measure came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, not the industry. But asked again, he said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson National</ENAMEX> product was brought to the staff's attention by people he wouldn't identify.
Whatever the case, the dispute shows that in the high-stakes world of financial services, where firms are waging a pitched battle for investors' dollars and future market share, even turning in a member of the family is sometimes considered acceptable.
And in the case of the 1988 restrictions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prucker</ENAMEX> encourages it. If insurers find other ways to get around the restrictions, he says, ``we would hope somebody would bring it to our attention again.
