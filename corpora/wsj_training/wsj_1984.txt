I approached ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastergate</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gelbart</ENAMEX>'s new comedy at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criterion Center</ENAMEX>, with considerable trepidation. Nothing, I assumed, would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>-Contra affair. I had underestimated, however, both Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX>'s wit and the persistence of scandal in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. Though the play clearly is framed around the events of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>-Contra, it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years. In fact, at one point Merry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melinda Mullins</ENAMEX>), a cool, carefully coiffed television announcer, recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years, concluding with those affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> and the savings and loan industry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Onstage</ENAMEX>, a congressional hearing is in progress, complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the Constitution in the background. The witness table is center stage and below it, the paraphernalia for the ever-present media, in this case <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNN</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Total News Network</ENAMEX>. Not only are there camera operators on all sides, but the proceedings are shown on monitors throughout the theater.
The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing -- the witnesses, the lawyers, the interrogators and the news media -- are performers.
As the story of ``Mastergate'' unfolds, we learn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes. The man, it seems, has a Lichtenstein corporation, licensed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX> and sheltered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bahamas</ENAMEX>. He himself lives in a ``consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>.'' The property seized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> film studio, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master Pictures Incorporated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MPI</ENAMEX>). Supposedly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> will sell off the assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MPI</ENAMEX>, but before it can, a lowly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> agent is called into the hospital room of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wylie Slaughter</ENAMEX>, the dying head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>.
The lowly agent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abel Lamb</ENAMEX>, who as you might guess, is being led to the slaughter, is ordered to take over the studio. Soon the studio is producing a $40 million picture called ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tet</ENAMEX>, the Motion Picture,'' to distinguish it from ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tet</ENAMEX>, the Offensive,'' as well as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tet</ENAMEX>, the Book'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tet</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Album.</ENAMEX>'' The picture, to be made in the Central American country of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Elvador</ENAMEX>, is a cover for sending $800 million of arms to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Otros</ENAMEX>, the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ambigua</ENAMEX>, which has been taken over by the leftist dictator Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Overtega</ENAMEX>, a former podiatrist, who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers. The man handling all this for the now-deceased Slaughter is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major Manley Battle</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX>'s stand in for Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX>.
Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Engler</ENAMEX> has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel von Bargen</ENAMEX> is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major Battle</ENAMEX>, mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Weiss</ENAMEX> is fire, brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zach Grenier</ENAMEX> is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Daly</ENAMEX> has the perfect ``aw, shucks'' demeanor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> in his portrayal of the vice president; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Mcdonough</ENAMEX> is first-rate as a succession of witnesses' wives. With one she is pregnant, with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag, and as the vice president's wife she rushes in with white hair, wearing a tailored suit and pearls, imitating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Bush</ENAMEX>'s gestures down to the last detail.
Though it's clear that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX>'s sympathies do not lie with the far right, it's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs, taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> also has fun with language. ``Mastergate'' is subtitled ``a play on words,'' and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> plays that game as well as anyone. He describes a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mastergate</ENAMEX> flunky as one who experienced a ``meteoric disappearance'' and found himself ``handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian Affairs.</ENAMEX>''
This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness, however. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> deplores the obfuscation, the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides. As the hearings begin, the self-important Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowman</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Kilty</ENAMEX>) announces: ``Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset: We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major Battle</ENAMEX> himself speaks in pure Pentagonese: ``Without further monetary-stroke-military aid, scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers, who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us, were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle.'' At another point he intones: ``Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy.''
The evening is short -- 95 minutes without an intermission -- but even so, as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX>'s satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably. Most of the evening, though, is filled with rare and welcome wit. In ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mastergate</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gelbart</ENAMEX> has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> theater: sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language.
