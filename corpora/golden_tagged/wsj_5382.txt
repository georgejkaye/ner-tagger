Three-and-a-half years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s leading computer whiz hit the skids.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kazuhiko Nishi</ENAMEX>, a flamboyant figure who popularized personal computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii Corp.</ENAMEX> were dumped by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX>, the U.S. software company whose products had become the main system for running Pcs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX> lost one-eighth of its revenue source -- sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> products -- and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX> was half a million dollars in debt to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. ``The guy's life is a mess,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s chairman, said at the time.
But today Ascii stock begins trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s over-the-counter market, highlighting the rebound of the company and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX>, its president, who was pegged as one of the rising stars of the business world in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>'s special centennial edition. Revenue has grown 70% over three years, to 24 billion yen ($164.6 million) in the year ended March 31. Operating earnings, which have lagged in recent years because of heavy investments as the company pursued a controversial diversification, now are expected to jump 20% annually. As for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX>, now 33, his personal stake in the company will be worth about $30 million.
``We suffered a lot our first year'' after the breakup, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX>. But, he adds, ``our going public proves our strategy of horizontally diversifying was correct.'' That strategy contributed to the split with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, as did Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX>'s sometimes unstructured management style.
Despite the rebound, critics still abound. ``It's not clear to me that there's a coherent strategy underlying'' the company's activities, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven W. Myers</ENAMEX>, a technology analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
And success is coming as much from adapting and maturing as from defying. ``We need some outside pressure to really get organized,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX> acknowledges as a major reason for going public.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX> and two friends founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX> in 1977 as a computer-magazine publisher. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX> gets a third of its revenue from publishing. It makes one-fifth of its revenue as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s largest seller of packaged software. But its biggest growth comes from computer equipment, mainly semiconductors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX> doesn't make the goods, but develops some, and markets some made by other companies. This accounts for 40% of revenue.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX> also is pushing into two new areas. One is electronic publishing, which includes networks linking computers, and data transmission by satellite. The other area, embraced in the past month, is the design of parts for advanced graphics and sound on Pcs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX>'s ventures often seem to stem as much from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX>'s whims and connections as from any grand strategy. An avid computer-game player, his company started designing a joy stick for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo Co.</ENAMEX>'s machines after he grew frustrated with the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX>'s equipment. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX> insists there is a common theme to his scattered projects: to improve and spread personal computers.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX> has many influential backers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s technology and financial worlds. Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s big computer companies hold a 1% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui & Co.</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s largest trading companies, plans to boost its stake to 5%.
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ascii</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX> have lost substantial influence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX>'s software packages once regularly had half the top 10 products in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, but now claim only one or two. That's partly because new competitors have emerged. But also, some of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX>'s theories have fallen flat in practice. When he developed his MSX operating system for Pcs six years ago, he hoped to make it the standard in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and possibly the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> While several million MSX-run machines have been sold, the system has a small percentage of the market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, some companies are relying less heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ascii</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chips & Technologies Inc.</ENAMEX>, a leading U.S. chip-design company that accounts for a large chunk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ascii</ENAMEX>'s semiconductor sales, is planning to set up its own Japanese operations in addition to using <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ascii</ENAMEX>.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nishi</ENAMEX> and his backers say he is learning from his mistakes. ``Kay once told me:'People used to listen to me, now I listen to them,''' recalls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masahiro Morimoto</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Research Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> operations. ``He's getting to be a good manager.
