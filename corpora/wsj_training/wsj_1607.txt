Directors of state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</ENAMEX> approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution.
Until now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>'s top managers and its directors have been appointed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> decree. But under the bank's proposed statutes, an assembly of shareholders must approve board members. The bank's chairman and director general, who also sit on the board, still would be appointed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>, which is controlled by the Italian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, was rocked by the disclosure last month that its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch extended more than $3 billion in unauthorized credits to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>. The ensuing scandal, in which the bank's management resigned, has helped renew calls for privatization, or at least an overhaul, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s banking system, which is about 80% state-controlled.
In a related move, the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank's new shareholding structure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> called a shareholders' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milan Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> scandal; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Consob</ENAMEX>, the stock exchange regulatory body, reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension.
