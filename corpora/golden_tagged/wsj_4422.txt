President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> to work rapidly with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> to help it develop ``a bold plan for economic recovery.''
In a speech to the annual meetings of the two international organizations, the president also proclaimed the benefits of greater economic freedom and sought to defend his administration's strategy for dealing with the international debt problem.
The president stressed the need for action to help emerging democracies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>. ``There may be no greater opportunity before us all today than the challenge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and, more broadly, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>,'' the president said.
Discussing his recent trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, the president said, ``We were impressed by the almost universal acceptance of the free market as the best hope -- indeed the only hope -- for reversing the economic fortunes of these proud countries.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s deputy prime minister and finance minister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leszek Balcerowicz</ENAMEX>, who is attending this year's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> meetings, said he presented an outline of his country's economic program in talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX>. He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> was seeking trade credits and guarantees totaling between $490 million and $500 million from its major trading partners in the West to help pay for essential imports during the fourth quarter of this year, when the first stage of economic changes would take place.
That stage would include ``unpopular measures'' such as the cutting of government subsidies and moving toward more of a market system, he said. ``This is the time for us to institute major reforms,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balcerowicz</ENAMEX> said, who added that his country ``would welcome offers of food aid during this stage.''
The second stage of changes, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balcerowicz</ENAMEX> said, would include measures to deal with inflation and to make the Polish currency fully convertible. ``We're counting on standby credits from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>,'' to help with this stage, the Polish minister said, but he declined to specify how much credit might be needed. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balcerowicz</ENAMEX> also described the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX>'s proposal of a $660 million economic aid package for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> for next year as ``an encouraging sign.''
The Polish minister made it clear that Poles understand the urgency of their situation. ``We have to move very quickly,'' he acknowledged. ``If we miss the opportunity there are very great consequences for us.''
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has pledged to give <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> $100 million in food aid from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> In a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> discussion yesterday with a small group of reporters, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> knocked down suggestions the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> might be prepared to offer more unilateral aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> now, indicating that such moves will come only after economic changes are in place.
``I want to work with them in every way we can,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said. ``But I think it's important that we see what their plan is of economic reform... Let's see what it is that is required in terms of reform and then we'll try to do everything we can.''
The Poles will need all the help they can get. ``The transformation of the Polish economy must be carried out in extremely adverse circumstances,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balcerowicz</ENAMEX> said. The level of industrial production is declining for the first time since 1982, and average living standards are below those of 10 years ago, he said.
The country, he added, is trying to fight these problems with a tight monetary policy, structural economic changes and foreign assistance. He said the Polish government is strictly controlling credit expansion, allowing interest rates to float, reducing the government's budget deficit and moving to a realistic, unified exchange rate.
Other ministers attending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> meetings were supportive of the Poles' efforts. But along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, they want to see <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> agree to a specific IMF program before they commit large sums of money.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s attempts to move toward a free-market economy are ``a major historical challenge for all of us,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryutaro Hashimoto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s finance minister. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hashimoto</ENAMEX> said he hadn't discussed the specifics of Japanese aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> in his meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balcerowicz</ENAMEX>.
British Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> told reporters that ``the main effort has to wait until after the fund {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>} program.'' He stressed the need for the western nations to concentrate their attention on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>.
News agencies reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juergen Warnke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s development aid minister, told reporters here that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IMF</ENAMEX> could conclude a three-year, standby agreement as early as November that would give the country $700 million a year in assistance. In his address, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> emphasized the advantages of economic freedom for the whole world. ``In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, courageous leaders are turning away from state control of their economies,'' he said.
Concerning his administration's debt strategy, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> ``has helped direct the focus on debt-reduction as a complement to continued new lending.'' That approach, which has already been somewhat refocused, ``is flexible enough to address the unique needs of each country,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, in particular, won Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s praise. Thanks to the new strategy and the vital support it has won from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>, that country is making ``enormous progress in reducing its debt burden,'' the president said.
