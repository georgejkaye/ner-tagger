Three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> officials sold shares last month, before the stock went into a tailspin this week on disappointing earnings news, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filings show.
Among those selling was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Freiburghouse</ENAMEX>, senior vice president of engineering. He sold 27% of his stake at the time, 28,938 shares, for $846,000 on Aug. 1, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings show. The transaction, which came on top of other sizable sales in March and May, boosted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freiburghouse</ENAMEX>'s total sales this year to 98,938 shares, or 91% of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX> holdings at the beginning of the year, according to the filings.
Two other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX> officials, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Donahue</ENAMEX>, the company's controller, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Thompson</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president, also sold shares in August. All three executives sold at $29.25 to $34 a share. Yesterday, this <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, maker of minicomputer systems closed at $25.75, down 25 cents, in over-the-counter trading.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings show that, since May, an additional seven insiders have sold between 260 and 5,000 shares each, all at prices above the current level.
Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freiburghouse</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donahue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached to comment. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Mcconnell</ENAMEX>, the company's assistant treasurer, said: ``When we reached a conclusion that it was unlikely that we would meet the revenue plan, right away, at that moment, we closed the window {on trading} for all officers and persons who were aware of that.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcconnell</ENAMEX> said the company became aware Thursday that it wouldn't realize third-quarter expectations. ``We made every effort to make this information public as soon as it became available to us,'' he added. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX> wouldn't confirm the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> figures on sales by the 10 executives.
The price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX> stock plummeted $7.25 Monday on more than 10 times normal volume. The plunge followed a company statement that Stratus expected to report third-quarter net income of 35 cents to 38 cents a share, sharply below analysts' estimates of about 47 cents a share.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Tarantino</ENAMEX>, head of over-the-counter trading at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> brokerage firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX>, said the earnings announcement came as a surprise to investors. Buyers aren't coming back in force to snap up Stratus stock at these depressed levels, he said. ``People figure, when there's smoke, there's fire.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus Computer</ENAMEX> ``may be moving into adolescence,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Muratore</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> While it's too early to draw long-term conclusions from the weaker-than-expected quarter, she said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stratus</ENAMEX> has entered a size range -- between about $300 million and $500 million in annual revenue -- where growth rates can become less predictable.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings, the August sale by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX>, the senior vice president of marketing, was 3,000 shares, representing 12% of his holdings; he received $102,000 for the shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings also show that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> sold a total of 4,413 shares in two earlier sales this year. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donahue</ENAMEX>, the controller, sold all of his stock, 1,807 shares, for $59,179, or $32.75 a share Aug. 25, according to the filings.
BIG BEARS SELLING: Seven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX> insiders, including the chairman and vice chairman, sold shares of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> brokerage firm in August.
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan C. Greenberg</ENAMEX> sold 343,111 shares, or 10% of his stake, for $5.8 million in several sales between Aug. 14 and Aug. 31. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> said he sold his shares to pay taxes and to fund charitable contributions.
The other insiders, he said, sold to diversify their assets. ``Some are getting older, and most of us have huge percentages {of our assets} in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> stock.''
He was joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. John Rosenwald Jr.</ENAMEX>, vice chairman, who sold 27% of his direct holdings, or 675,000 shares. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenwald</ENAMEX>, who also holds 544 shares indirectly, received $11.4 million for his shares. He wasn't available to comment.
Five other officials sold between 20,000 and 37,500 shares each in August at $16.38 to $17 a share.
The sales came after two substantial stock distributions to company officials by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> earlier this year, a spokeswoman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> closed yesterday at $16, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
ALL THAT <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GLITTERS</ENAMEX>: Insiders have been  selling at two gold producers, in some cases benefiting from recent upturns in prices of gold stocks.
The strongest metals-stock selling was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Barrick Resources Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> gold producer. Two senior vice presidents, the treasurer and the chief financial officer all sold shares in August at prices near the 52-week high of $32 Canadian (US$27), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings show.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Garbutt</ENAMEX>, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the shares sold were acquired in January by exercising options that were part of their total remuneration package.
There has also been selling at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echo Bay Mines Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edmonton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>, gold and silver mining concern. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Zigarlick Jr.</ENAMEX>, president, sold a total of 19,500 shares Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, some at C$18.88 and the rest at C$19.00, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings, leaving him with 45,200 shares. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Clarke</ENAMEX>, senior vice president, operations, sold 10,000 shares, half his holdings, on Aug. 22.
Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zigarlick</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> could be reached. Questions were referred to a spokesman at the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX> office, who wasn't available.
Analysts said that prices of gold stocks have turned up a bit in the past couple of months, although the price of gold itself has been in a decline since late 1987. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Barrick</ENAMEX> closed yesterday at $22.375, up 25 cents, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, and at C$26.50 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> exchange. Echo Bay closed yesterday at $15, down 25 cents, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, and at C$17.75 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> exchange.
