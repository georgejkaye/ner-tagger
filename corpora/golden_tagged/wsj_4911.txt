A major stumbling block over the different ways that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Andersen & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX> fund their retirement plans could scuttle the proposed merger of the two big accounting firms, parties close to both firms said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen</ENAMEX> accrues or sets up a reserve for its partners in advance of their retirement, and they generally get between $25,000 and $50,000 a year in benefits after they retire, the parties said.
On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> doesn't fund its retirement benefits in advance and pays its partners about $100,000 a year after they retire, they added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Emerson</ENAMEX>, publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emerson's Professional Services Review</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bellevue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, said that ``more people in the profession are saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen and Price</ENAMEX> merger is unlikely.'' He added: ``There may just be too many stumbling blocks.''
Officials at both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX> declined comment on the merger talks. Three months ago the two firms announced that they were beginning discussions that could lead to a merger over the following 60 days. Earlier this month, they said the talks were being extended indefinitely. If the two firms merged, they would become the biggest U.S. and world-wide accounting firm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Stiling</ENAMEX>, who resigned from Andersen last month as a managing director in consulting to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC Consulting Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, as a group vice president, said that the hurdles that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> must overcome are formidable. ``There's the differences in funding the pension plans, who will get the balance of power and other major economic issues,'' he said.
Combining the two retirement plans would be extremely tough, say benefit consultants. ``It could be done, but it would be difficult, expensive and detailed,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Golden</ENAMEX>, a partner in Kwasha <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipton</ENAMEX>, a Fort <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>-based benefits consulting firm. ``And even after they're joined, in order to preserve previous benefits on both sides, you'd have to produce a hydra-headed monster that might be difficult to administrate.''
There are several other major hurdles to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen-Price</ENAMEX> merger, other accountants say. As one of the biggest computer systems consultants, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX> does some joint ventures with companies like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX>, both audit clients of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price.</ENAMEX> Accounting profession ethics rules ban business ties with audit clients.
Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> currently is asking for reams of data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> and four other firms that already have merged to see if the transactions violate antitrust law. Earlier this year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst & Whinney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Young & Co.</ENAMEX> joined as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernst & Young</ENAMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins & Sells</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touche, Ross & Co.</ENAMEX> combined as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte & Touche</ENAMEX>. The data concern financial analyses used in the mergers, client data bases and results of recent proposals to prospective clients.
Other sticking points include the name of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Andersen</ENAMEX>-Price firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX>'s recent lid on consulting revenue reverting to other partners and profit results at both firms that didn't meet previously set targets, parties close to the firms said. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen-Price</ENAMEX> talks resume this week after a week's hiatus and they ``could blow up or jell,'' said a party close to the talks.
Two major impending deadlines are the U.S. partners' meetings of both firms, each scheduled for mid-October. ``They've got to have something to tell their partners by then,'' said a knowledgeable party.
