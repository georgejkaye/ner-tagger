The 1989 Albert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lasker Medical Research Awards</ENAMEX> went to the creator of the French ``abortion pill,'' a poet of human biology and four scientists who deciphered how cells respond to the body's subtle signals.
The prestigious awards, presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, are widely believed to be an indicator of future Nobel Prize awards and thus are watched with great interest in the medical and scientific communities. The award in each category carries a $15,000 prize.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lasker</ENAMEX> award for clinical medical research went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etienne-Emile Baulieu</ENAMEX>, professor of biochemistry at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Paris School of Medicine</ENAMEX>, for his work on the role of steroid hormones in the brain and in sexual function.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baulieu</ENAMEX>'s work erupted into global controversy with his development of RU 486, a drug that stops pregnancy by preventing a fertilized egg from being implanted in the womb. Anti-abortion activists raged against its use, causing a temporary halt in clinical trials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
Sidestepping that debate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lasker Foundation</ENAMEX> simply noted that RU 486 is a ``safe, effective'' means of preventing pregnancy and avoiding surgical abortion as well as a model for investigating other hormonal conditions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Thomas</ENAMEX>, physician, author and scholar-in-residence at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University Medical College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, was awarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Albert Lasker Public Service</ENAMEX> Award ``for opening the wonders of 20th-century medical research and practice to the average person.''
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> was honored for poetic writings about medical science in such books as ``Lives of a Cell,'' which won a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Book Award</ENAMEX>.
The award for basic medical research was given to four pioneers of ``signal transduction,'' the process whereby the body sends signals to trillions of cells that prompt them to function. These systemic messengers govern basic functions such as regulation of the heartbeat, blood pressure, cell growth and brain activity.
The basic science winners are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J. Berridge</ENAMEX>, deputy chief scientific officer, department of zoology, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambridge University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred G. Gilman</ENAMEX>, professor of pharmacology, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin G. Krebs</ENAMEX>, professor of pharmacology, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> School of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasutomi Nishizuka</ENAMEX>, chairman, department of biology, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kobe University School of Medicine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
