<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melvin Jacobs</ENAMEX>, the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX>, said in an interview that he intends to lead a leveraged buy-out of the 46-store specialty retailer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX>'s parent company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>, on Tuesday announced its intention to sell its U.S. retail group, which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX>, Southern department store chain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivey</ENAMEX>'s and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Breuners</ENAMEX> furniture chain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> is attempting to thwart Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s $21 billion takeover bid.
``Our thinking through the period prior to Tuesday's announcement was that if our company was going to be offered for sale, management was interested in buying it,'' said the 63-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX>, who also is chief executive officer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> also has said it hopes to buy that retail business.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> said he has been approached by numerous investment bankers interested in helping him with a buy-out bid, but he hasn't made any financing decisions. Noting that many retail industry buy-outs have failed this year because they were financed with high-interest junk bonds and bridge loans, which left retailers with insufficient cash flow, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> said, ``We don't want to follow the unsuccessful acts. We will need partners who want a good return but are willing to take a long-range view.''
In 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> generated $1.2 billion in sales, with operating profits estimated at $95 million. The specialty retailer is known for its assortment of expensive clothes made by such designers as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvin Klein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Blass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giorgio Armani</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> is strongest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> metropolitan area, where it operates seven stores. However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> said that the chain has also developed strong followings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, where Saks operates five units. In 1990 Saks will open new stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> does have some problems. The company opened a second store in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> in 1983, and it was hurt by the collapse of the oil-based economy. It now appears that the neighborhood in which it is located will never be able to support the store. A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks</ENAMEX> branch in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tulsa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okla.</ENAMEX>, which opened in 1986, also has been a disappointment.
Analysts have estimated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> retail group will bring as much as $3 billion. Possible bidders include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard Department Stores Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">May Department Stores Co.</ENAMEX> Industry observers say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> may bring as much as $1.5 billion and Marshall Field as much as $1.2 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Martinez</ENAMEX>, group executive for retailing for the U.S. subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> doesn't generally favor management-led buy-outs. However, he added, ``To the extent that the management offers are competitive, they will be given a lot of support.
