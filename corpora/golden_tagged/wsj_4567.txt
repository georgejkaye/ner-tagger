When word got out early this year that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Asset Disposition Association</ENAMEX> might be put on the auction block by the government, eager banks, accounting firms and real-estate companies began lining up to bid.
But now that a government official has recommended that FADA be sold next month without its most coveted asset -- contracts to manage and sell $1.8 billion of real estate taken from insolvent thrifts -- potential buyers are starting to put away their checkbooks.
With the contracts, which generated $30 million in revenue last year, a buyer would have received a leg up -- if not a clearly dominant market share -- in the increasingly competitive business of managing real estate for the government. ``Without the contracts, I'm not sure it's worth anything,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Mcfarland</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skyline Financial Services Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falls Church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcfarland</ENAMEX> adds that he would bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> only if the management contracts were included.
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FADA</ENAMEX> was created in 1985 by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Bank Board</ENAMEX>, the conservators and receivers appointed to take control of insolvent thrifts were responsible for disposing of the institution's foreclosed properties. The now-defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank Board</ENAMEX> hoped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> would manage properties more efficiently, but from the start, it was plagued by bad publicity about the large salaries paid its top executives and for its seeming slowness in selling foreclosed properties.
Although many of those problems had been resolved by new management, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> was at the top of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s hit list when negotiations started earlier this year over the restructuring of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank Board</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX>
With the recent passage of the Bush administration's thrift-rescue package, responsibility for dealing with $400 billion in assets was handed to the newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> And when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> said that it would contract out much of that responsibility, it was hit with a flood of applications from companies claiming real-estate management expertise.
With assets and expertise in place, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> seemed like a plum for anyone interested in competing for some of that business. But many potential buyers were interested primarily in the valuable management contracts. Although the full details of the package won't be known until the bid solicitations go out as early as next week, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Seelig</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDIC</ENAMEX>'s liquidation division, says he has recommended that FADA be sold without the contracts. ``It's our belief that that was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s intent'' in ordering the agency's dissolution, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seelig</ENAMEX> says.
Without the contracts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> would go on the block as a property-management company with four regional real-estate offices, an extensive computer system and a staff of about 275 people, including lawyers, appraisers and salespeople. The computer system has attracted the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> banking unit, according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> spokesman, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seelig</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDIC</ENAMEX> wants to review bids for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> before considering a piece-by-piece liquidation.
Other bidders who were interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> and its contracts, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BEI Foster Real Estate Services Inc.</ENAMEX>, say they will think twice about making an offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> as just another real-estate company. ``You're basically selling an organization without much to work with,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Adair</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BEI Foster.</ENAMEX>
But at least a few potential buyers say they're still willing to look at the bid packages. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Brown</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grant Thornton</ENAMEX>'s national real-estate industry committee, says the accounting firm may yet consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> for its staff and some of its fixed assets.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Robert Jr.</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.E. Robert Cos.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, says he'll stay in the market for FADA although he concedes that he's unsure that FADA ``in its present structure, can be competitive.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> says he believes the agency can be made competitive, but he declined to share his strategy.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> also cites <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX>'s staff and its experience in dealing with troubled real estate as a selling point, as does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W. Wills</ENAMEX>, who has been pushing for a prompt decision on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX>'s future to help stem defections from the agency.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wills</ENAMEX> may have a point. Just last Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene C. Mcquown</ENAMEX> quit as regional manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FADA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> office, the largest of the agency's four real-estate offices. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcquown</ENAMEX> started work Monday as vice president and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> regional manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.E. Robert Cos</ENAMEX>.
