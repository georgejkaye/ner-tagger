<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambridge Bioscience Corp.</ENAMEX> said it expects to report a ``larger-than-anticipated loss'' for the third quarter, partly because of sluggish demand for its rapid AIDS test.
The biotechnology company also said it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, which posted a second-quarter loss of $897,969, previously said it hoped to reduce its losses quarter-by-quarter. In the third quarter of 1988, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Worcester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, concern had a loss of $1.9 million on revenue of $1.3 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Buck</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer, cited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> delays in approving the company's new advanced AIDS test as an added factor in the third-quarter loss. He said the recently announced acquisition of certain assets of closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angenics Inc.</ENAMEX> will contribute to the expected fourth-quarter loss.
Despite the disappointing third-quarter performance, ``we remain optimistic moving into 1990,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buck</ENAMEX> said. ``Most of our products are selling at or ahead of budget, and we expect that sales of our rapid AIDS test will respond to more aggressive marketing efforts.''
In national over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX> closed at $8, down 87.5 cents.
