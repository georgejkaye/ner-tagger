Traders called the first day of trading in a new 10-year government of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> bond futures contract a solid success with an estimated 2,746 contracts, or a face amount of 274.6 million Canadian dollars (US$231.5 million), changing hands.
``It was fantastic,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Sevigny</ENAMEX>, director of trading for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcneil Mantha Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sevigny</ENAMEX> also traded for his own account Friday in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal Exchange</ENAMEX>'s new futures pit. He said the market functioned well, with ``good volatility and good volume.''
But he and other traders warned the test for the contract will come in the next month. ``If we can keep that volume for a week or two, then we'll have a solid base,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sevigny</ENAMEX> said.
The C$100,000/NNP contract is based on a 10-year government of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> bond with a 9% coupon. A futures contract obligates the holder to buy or sell a security or commodity at a given price within a specified period. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal Exchange</ENAMEX> contract is the only existing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> bond futures contract.
