<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> has galvanized the struggling European market for electronic messaging with its planned purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel Ltd.</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s biggest players in the field.
The planned # 180 million ($291 million) acquisition, announced yesterday as expected, marks the U.S. communications giant's entry into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s $1.5 billion market for electronic transmission of corporate documents and messages over computer-controlled phone lines. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> move ``will stimulate the whole business,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Stevens</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based industry consultant with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Input Ltd.</ENAMEX> Though fast-growing, he added, the European market is small and ``needs a kick.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s purchase -- and extra investments it says it may make -- will bring much-needed cash to speed development of such services in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. And as the biggest buy-out in the field so far, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> move will also prompt its competitors to boost their own investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. A pack of acquisition-hungry rivals already has assembled. About 20 U.S., European and Japanese companies vied against each other and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> this year for the prize of buying Istel in an auction held by its board.
For the past few years, U.S. businesses have been wiring themselves rapidly to send each other invoices, orders, memos and other messages over computer networks, rather than through the mail or by courier. European businesses, by contrast, have been more cautious. A recent survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Logica PLC</ENAMEX>, a British consulting firm, found just 16% of big European corporations have begun using such ``electronic document interchange'' services. But interest is rising fast: An additional 17% said they would begin electronic document transmissions soon.
Such surveys, along with industry forecasts of 20%-plus annual sales growth for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, have the world's computer and telecommunications companies ready to move. Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>, such U.S. giants as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> (unrelated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>) have been expanding their electronic messaging businesses around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The local competition includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siemens AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S.p. A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Computers Ltd.</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STC PLC</ENAMEX>.
A decade of telecommunications deregulation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> has made this country the hottest market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for electronic document interchange, and the first port-of-call for multinationals such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> seeking a European berth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> ranks second in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDI</ENAMEX> market, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Network Services Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a 60-40 joint venture between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Computers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>. ``We welcome any move which stimulates the uptake of (document interchange and other electronic message services) on a global scale,'' said a spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICL</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> venture, commenting on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> move.
As reported, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> purchase would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s first big move into document interchange and related services in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> or the U.S. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> hopes eventually to import some Istel services and products to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Berndt</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Communications Services</ENAMEX> division. These may include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edict</ENAMEX>, an Istel computer-software system that manages document interchanges. Moreover, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berndt</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> is prepared to fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX>'s planned expansion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, which last year provided only about 1% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>-dominated revenue of # 85.1 million.
But the steep sales price, 25 times <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX>'s expected net income this year of about # 7 million, shows just how hungry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT*</ENAMEX> is for a foothold in electronic messaging. Besides its strength in document interchange, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX>'s computer networks carry more than half the package-holiday travel bookings made electronically in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> also provides an electronic information-service that offers British life-insurance and mortgage price quotations. Still, document interchange and these other electronic-communications services currently represent just 20% to 30% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX>'s total revenue, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Leighfield</ENAMEX> forecast that figure will reach 60% in the mid-1990s.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX>'s biggest business today is in an odd field for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>: 38% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> revenues come from managing the computers of British car maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rover Group PLC</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> was a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rover</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace PLC</ENAMEX> unit, until an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> management buy-out in 1987. Included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s purchase price for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> is an undisclosed sum to buy out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rover</ENAMEX>'s remaining 23.6% Istel stake. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX>'s other revenue sources include planning complete computer systems for clients; setting up computerized factory-automation systems; and running back-up computers in case a client's main computers fail. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> said it doesn't plan to shed these businesses.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> purchase also increases its competition with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecommunications PLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s main phone company. For years, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX> has been an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> customer, buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> phone equipment, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> partner, handling the British end of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> phone calls. But last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX> pounced on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s own turf by agreeing to pay $355 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tymnet</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> unit that runs an Istel-type network in the U.S. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s purchase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> will make it a direct competitor to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX> in managing the basic computer networks on which electronic document interchange and other services run.
Yesterday, officials of both phone giants played down the significance of their growing rivalry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX> called itself ``fairly neutral'' about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s purchase, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berndt</ENAMEX> denied speculation that his company may seek a license to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX>'s main business of providing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s basic phone service.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> didn't take any chances of a diplomatic tiff with its old partner. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berndt</ENAMEX> said he sent his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX> counterpart word of the purchase on Monday night -- along with a complimentary advance copy of the news release.
