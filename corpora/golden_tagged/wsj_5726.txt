<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesa Limited Partnership</ENAMEX>, straining under the double burden of low gas prices and hefty debt payments incurred in last year's acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenneco Inc.</ENAMEX> properties, declared lower third-quarter distributions and hinted at additional lower payouts.
The oil and gas producer declared distributions of 37 1/2 cents for each common unit and for each preference A unit, payable Nov. 17 to holders of record Oct. 6. The distribution in the second quarter had been 50 cents per unit.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesa</ENAMEX> spokesman said the partnership expects to make fourth-quarter distributions at the same rate, but cautioned that ``further developments in industry conditions'' could dictate a change. One of those developments is a Sept. 15 federal court ruling that could result in industrywide refunds of as much as $100 million to natural gas consumers.
Mesa has nearly $400 million in debt from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenneco</ENAMEX> acquisition and finished the second quarter with a net loss of $13.4 million.
