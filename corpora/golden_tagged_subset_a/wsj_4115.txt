Where's the small-stock rally?
For months now, boosters of the issues have been predicting their resurgence; so far, they've been wrong.
``The process is taking a bit longer than we expected,'' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bernstein</ENAMEX>, a quantitative analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>.
Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Keith Mullins</ENAMEX>, small-stock analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX>, ``the third quarter wasn't very positive for the group.''
Indeed, since their energetic performance in the first quarter, stocks with market values below $400 million have turned lethargic. During the third quarter, small-stock barometers trailed those of larger issues. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite Index of over-the-counter stocks rose 8.64% and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russell</ENAMEX> 2000 Index of small stocks improved only 6.44%. By comparison, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average has gained 10.36% and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s 500-stock index 9.80% since June 30.
If there is any doubt that investors still prefer larger stocks, consider this: The 200 largest OTC issues, which have market values of more than $500 million, also kept pace with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> stocks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specifically</ENAMEX>, the Nasdaq 100 Index of industrial stocks surged 12.17% during the latest three months. Its counterpart, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nasdaq Financials</ENAMEX>, grew 12.60%.
Analysts insist that the small-stock revival is just around the corner. But the issues apparently are having trouble negotiating the turn. Mostly, that's because investors have found all sorts of reasons not to buy small stocks.
At first, investors were trying to figure out whether the economy would have a soft landing when it slowed, or slide into a recession, and they didn't buy much of anything. It didn't help either when cash-laden money managers, who panicked about missing the stock market rally and embarked on a spring buying spree, didn't put small stocks on their shopping lists. Not even the euphoria over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials setting all-time highs has altered investors' caution toward small stocks. And analysts say that foreign investors, who have shown more interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> stocks lately, still won't go near smaller issues because the stocks are harder to buy and sell quickly.
Some of the blame also goes to program trading -- the computer-driven buying and selling of stocks that is tied to movements in certain stock indexes. Portfolio managers and analysts claim that small stocks can't keep up with larger ones when program buying dominates trading, as it has for much of the summer.
``When program trading has influence, (big) stocks tend to be involved and the small caps aren't,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Freeman</ENAMEX>, a portfolio manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Asset Management</ENAMEX>, a money management unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton.</ENAMEX>
Small-stock analysts continue to put their faith in the fact that small stocks have outperformed the broader market over the past 62 years. Small-stock booms usually come at five-year intervals. Smaller issues beat larger ones in 1988, after lagging since 1983.
Some brokers now report that investors are beginning to shop among smaller issues because their earnings-growth prospects are more attractive now than most larger stocks. Of course, such expectations have come back to haunt small stocks in the past. Investors habitually punish stocks when company earnings don't live up to expectations.
Nevertheless, small-stock boosters say, the group still is relatively cheap, and investors won't ignore the issues forever.
``The time is ripe for rotation into smaller stocks,'' contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Mcalinden</ENAMEX>, director of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillon Read.</ENAMEX> From now until the end of the year, investors will look for buying opportunities among segments that haven't advanced a lot. ``Since Nasdaq and small stocks have lagged , that's where the money will flow,'' he says.
Sometimes the small stocks' surge begins during a market correction in which those issues don't suffer as much as bigger stocks do, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Manley</ENAMEX>, a portfolio manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Investors Management</ENAMEX>. Investors who take note of the group snap the issues up, causing small stocks to outperform larger issues when the market rebounds, he says.
There are signs that such a cycle might be under way. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> lost almost 3% and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> dropped 2% during September, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite eased only 0.3% and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russell</ENAMEX> 2000 was down 1%.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manley</ENAMEX> thinks small stocks will rally eventually, he doesn't expect it to happen soon. ``If the market took off now, I doubt that small stocks would outperform bigger issues,'' he says. ``We need more of a correction before they can assume leadership.''
Friday's Market Activity
