The English yuppie may be an endangered species: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filofax PLC</ENAMEX>, British maker of the trendy, leatherbound diaries known as the ``Yuppie's Bible,'' reported its first-ever loss.
Through much of the 1980s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filofax</ENAMEX>'s bulging, monogrammed appointment books were mandatory fashion accessories for young, wealthy climbers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s financial district. Along with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mont Blanc</ENAMEX> pens and cellular phones, $180-and-up Filofaxes have also caught on with the flaunt-your-wealth crowd in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, at least, the bubble has burst. The 68-year-old Filofax company, based in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> suburb, reported a # 554,000 ($875,000) pretax loss in the first half -- a near-complete reversal of its # 571,000 pretax profit a year earlier. Its sales slid 19% to # 4.4 million from # 5.5 million. The bottom line: a net loss of # 519,000, compared with an earlier profit of # 358,000. Worse, ``a very disappointing trading result'' was forecast for the entire year.
The crumpled profit, after a year of stagnant earnings in 1988, follows that day marked in black in most <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> yuppies' Filofaxes: Oct. 19, 1987, the day the stock market crashed. Since, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porsches</ENAMEX>, chic loft apartments and other luxuries have wilted, as thousands of once-rich young <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> brokers, research analysts and bankers have found themselves out of jobs. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filofax</ENAMEX> officials -- who always denied the yuppie label -- insist their problems aren't related to the crash.
``I doubt you could say more than 5% of our users are yuppies'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, bristled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Collischon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filofax</ENAMEX> chairman, when questioned about the sales slump. He allows that U.S. sales, accounting for about 12% of Filofax revenue last year and growing this year at a brisk 25% rate, are ``much more oriented towards fashion'' than in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. He blamed the British sales slump primarily on high interest rates and reduced consumer spending. He called those temporary problems, to be overcome a new strategy.
The once-stodgy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filofax</ENAMEX> is taking a page out of other marketers' books. Eschewing its understated strategy of selling primarily by word-of-mouth, Filofax this year plans its first, big-budget advertising campaign. It's also diversifying: This year, it launched a pocket Filofax and a desk-top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filofax</ENAMEX>. It's even planning a promotional gimmick -- for a limited time, buyers of its # 65 Winchester model can get two round-trip air-tickets to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, provided they also buy a package holiday with a designated travel agency.
``We're going through a difficult time,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collischon</ENAMEX> said, ``but I have tremendous faith in the future of the company.
