<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax aren't ready to line up behind the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> proposal.
Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut, which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year, when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>.
Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX>, the ranking GOP member on the tax-writing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX>, last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>) was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds, perhaps as soon as today. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> all but conceded defeat, telling Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>: ``I sense at this stage you may have the votes.''
The two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion, violating usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> decorum. Their tone was good-natured, with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again.
Although the proposal, authored by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Roth</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del.</ENAMEX>), appears to have general backing by Republicans, their votes aren't sufficient to pass it. And Democrats, who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut, are finding reasons to say no, at least for now. A major reason is that they believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood-Roth</ENAMEX> plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood-Roth</ENAMEX> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held. It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first-home purchases and tuition.
``A number of us are not going to touch capital gains, Iras or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction,'' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Robb</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>), who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the Bush administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators, there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year, according to participants.
The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success. ``There is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it this year,'' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, a leading Democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains tax. He called the battle ``uphill.''
Other Democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic. ``There will be no capital-gains bill this year,'' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ark.</ENAMEX>). ``I'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal. The IRA portion (of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood-Roth</ENAMEX> plan) is irresponsible.''
Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally.
Today, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> and other leading Democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to bash the proposal. Estimates requested by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Joint Taxation Committee</ENAMEX> show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $13 million each in 1985, the last year for which figures are available.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood-Roth</ENAMEX> capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>. As a result, the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut.
Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> have suggested ways of ``tinkering'' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood-Roth</ENAMEX> proposal, suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back, one official said.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> aides think that there are numerous other important measures Democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with Democrats. A capital-gains tax cut might be paired with such measures to help ensure passage. Other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage.
If they can't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan, administration officials also aren't ruling out making a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to put off a vote until a firm date in the future, even next year. But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.

Japanese immigration authorities said they found 658 more Chinese among Vietnamese boat people, bringing the number of Chinese trying to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> by posing as Vietnamese refugees this year to 1,642.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> plans to send the Chinese back home and is negotiating with the Chinese government, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Ministry</ENAMEX> official said. The Chinese were among 3,372 boat people supposedly from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> who arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> this year, compared with 219 for all of 1988, the official said.
The 658 Chinese, who have been in a refugee-assistance center, were sent to immigration facilities yesterday pending deportation to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, the official said.
On Sept. 13, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> began a policy of screening boat people, accepting only those deemed to be political refugees.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francoise Verne</ENAMEX>, 52-year-old former deputy director of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s mint, faces prison for her theft of some 67 rare coins from the mint's collections. Second in command from 1979 to 1984, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verne</ENAMEX> told a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> court that the ``great disorder'' that reigned at the agency led her into temptation. Before an inventory in 1984 that showed the ``disappearance'' of 944 coins valued at about 2.9 million French francs (about $465,000), there hadn't been any stock-taking since 1868. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony Lambert</ENAMEX>, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verne</ENAMEX>'s successor, says the mint's losses from the theft run into the hundreds of thousands of francs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Salvador</ENAMEX> is destroying more than 1.6 million pounds of food that had rotted in government warehouses, government officials said. The state Supply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulator Institute</ENAMEX> is to burn rice, corn and beans that spoiled because of neglect and corruption in the previous Christian Democrat government, a statement from the information service SISAL said. During the past administration the foodstuffs were first bought by the institute, then sold at low prices to ``unscrupulous businessmen'' who resold them to the institute at inflated prices, the statement said.
A black-draped cruise liner sailed into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naples</ENAMEX> yesterday bringing 800 Libyans threatening vengeance if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> refuses to pay compensation for more than 30 years of colonial rule. Another 250 Libyans were already in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> to stage a day of mourning for victims of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s colonial rule between 1911 and 1943, when Tripoli says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rome</ENAMEX> kidnapped 5,000 Libyans and deported them as forced labor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libya</ENAMEX>'s revolutionary Committees have threatened attacks on Italians if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> doesn't pay compensation. But officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> say the issue was legally resolved by a settlement between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">King Idris</ENAMEX>, deposed by Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muammar Gadhafi</ENAMEX> in 1969.
Canadian Indians are taking five countries to court in a bid to stop low military flights over their homes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dutch Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inuit</ENAMEX> and Cree peoples living in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> and Labrador in northeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting, a ministry spokesman said. They also wanted to prevent a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> training base being built in the region, he said. The action, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Federal Court</ENAMEX>, will be against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the ministry spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> suspended imports of French mushrooms after finding some contaminated by radiation, an official of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Health</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welfare</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> has been testing imported food from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, the spokesman said. Since then, the ministry has announced 50 bans on food imports from European countries, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>.
The Venice city council is battling plans to tap huge gas fields off the coast that it says will speed up the city's slow sinking into its lagoon.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGIP</ENAMEX>, the state-owned energy giant, made the announcement about the gas field last month. Located six miles northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venice</ENAMEX>, the field contains 875 billion cubic feet of methane gas-one-tenth of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s reserves.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alarmed</ENAMEX> councilors say the project could jeopardize costly efforts to stop, or slow down, the subsidence that makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giulio Andreotti</ENAMEX>, who has yet to reply.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGIP</ENAMEX> refused to reconsider and says drilling is due to start early next year. ``It's unlikely extracting the gas will cause subsidence,'' says a spokeswoman.
Thieves stole a 12th century fresco from an abandoned church in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camerino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>, by removing the entire wall on which the work had been painted, police said.... <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX> commissioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuremberg</ENAMEX> post office to test a prototype battery-powered car. The vehicle has a top speed of 65 miles an hour and requires recharging from a standard wall socket every 100 miles.
