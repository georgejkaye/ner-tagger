The French building group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dumez S.A.</ENAMEX> said profit jumped 70% in the first half of 1989, partly on the strength of nonrecurring gains from a share issue by its Canadian unit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dumez</ENAMEX> said group profit after payments to minority interests rose to 252 million francs ($40.1 million) from 148 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 40% to 13.32 billion francs from 9.53 billion.
The group noted that 75 million francs of the advance reflected a one-time gain from the June offering by its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Westburne</ENAMEX> unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. It didn't say if its year-earlier results were influenced significantly by nonrecurring elements.
For all of 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dumez</ENAMEX> had group profit of 452 million francs after payment to minority interests. Revenue was 21.98 billion francs.
The group hasn't forecast full-year earnings for 1989, although it said that its first-half results aren't a good indication because of one-time elements and the seasonal nature of its operations.
