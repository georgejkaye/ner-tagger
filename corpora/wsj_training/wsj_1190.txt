<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> is considering a legal challenge to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>'s plan to buy half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime Networks Inc.</ENAMEX>, a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry's two most powerful players.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> is also fighting the transaction on other fronts, by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> as investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Showtime</ENAMEX>, cable-TV industry executives say. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> officials declined to comment.
Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> agreed to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Inc.</ENAMEX> $225 million for a 50% stake in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> subsidiary, which is a distant second to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time's Home Box Office</ENAMEX> in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s largest cable company, said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX>'s largest customer, and the two have a number of other business relationships. Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> even discussed bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> in as an investor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HBO</ENAMEX>, executives at both companies said. The purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> stake is ``a direct slap in our face,'' said one senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> executive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit charging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Showtime</ENAMEX>. Executives involved in plotting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s defense say it is now preparing a countersuit naming both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> as defendants. The executives say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated, or may seek constraints that would prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Showtime</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> officials declined to comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Kern</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>' chief outside counsel, said he wasn't aware of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s legal plans. But he said that any effort by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> to characterize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> as anti-competitive would be ``the pot calling the kettle black.''
``It's hard to see how an investment by the largest {cable operator} in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive, when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest'' cable operator, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kern</ENAMEX> said.
In addition to owning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX>, with 22 million subscribers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> controls close to 12 million cable subscribers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> has about one million. In its suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> argues that in joining up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> has potentially more power, particularly since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> also owns cable networks <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MTV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">VH</ENAMEX>-1 and Nick at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nite</ENAMEX>. Ironically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> have often worked closely in the cable business. Together, they control nearly 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> has a 21.8% stake, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> has a 17.8% stake. But since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, relations between the two have become strained. Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated.
Meanwhile, some legal observers say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> investment and other developments are weakening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>'s antitrust suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX> accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> in its suit of refusing to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> or a sister service, The Movie Channel, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s Manhattan Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems. But yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> Cable announced it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> has also accused HBO of locking up the lion's share of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> has continued to sign new contracts with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> studios, and yesterday announced it will buy movies from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, which currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX>.
