<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA Corp.</ENAMEX> said it plans to sell by spring 1992 all 15 passenger planes it acquired earlier this year in its 248 million Canadian dollar (US$211.6 million) purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wardair Inc.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX>, which recently merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wardair</ENAMEX>'s operations with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX>-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Airlines International Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s second-biggest airline, said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> wouldn't estimate the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wardair</ENAMEX>'s aircraft, which include 12 Airbus A310-300s and three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747-100s. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Ireland</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>-based technical analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avmark Inc.</ENAMEX>, an aircraft evaluation firm, estimated the total ``half-life'' value of the 15 planes at about $650 million or more.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> said 11 DC10-30 aircraft that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> also said it plans to sell, beginning in 1992, have a current half-life value of about $34 million each, or a total $374 million, raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $1.02 billion.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> said current demand for used aircraft is strong, partly because surging orders for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists. He predicted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers.
Under its revised fleet plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994, and add four more Boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> said two of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 767-300ER aircraft scheduled for delivery in 1990 would be leased out for two to five years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> didn't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based analyst estimated it at about $450 million (US), excluding replacement costs for the 11 DC10-30 aircraft that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> plans to sell, and purchase costs for as many as 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> previously ordered.
``I don't see this as a debt reduction exercise. It's focused on streamlining'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX>'s fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft servicing costs, the analyst said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX>'s long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to C$1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter, nearly double the year-earlier figure, reflecting debt absorbed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wardair</ENAMEX> purchase.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA</ENAMEX> said it also expects to announce by Tuesday whether it will take delivery of all 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft it previously ordered. The first five leased units were to be delivered in 1991.
