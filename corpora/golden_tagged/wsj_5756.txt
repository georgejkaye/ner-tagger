As students of television lip reading no doubt will recall, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Ditka</ENAMEX>, coach of football's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> Bears, over the years has had numerous differences of opinion with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Tomczak</ENAMEX>, his quarterback. Such is the nature of their relationship that the disputes continued even after a victorious Sunday here at the expense of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> Vikings.
Their latest debate, conducted in separate post-game interviews, was over statistics and the sort of people who value them.
``Statistics are for idiots,'' declared Ditka.
``Statistics are for critics,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomczak</ENAMEX>.
But, hmmm, maybe it wasn't an argument after all. Maybe those guys were talking about the same folks. Or maybe it's that both are able to see things that the, uh, critics can't. ``Our win today wasn't pretty, but we knew it wouldn't look pretty,'' summed up Ditka without rebuttal. ``We feel we're a little better than we look.''
As it was, the Bears looked pretty good on Sunday or, at least, for one quarter of a gloriously sunny afternoon that made even decrepit Soldier Field look good. That was the fourth quarter, in which they outscored the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX>, 28-0, en route to a 38-7 win, their second in as many appearances in this still-new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Football</ENAMEX> League season. Come to think of it, they must have played OK for the first three quarters, too, or they wouldn't have been ahead.
So what if baby-faced quarterback <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomczak</ENAMEX> had a 10-for-26 passing day on top of 10-for-24 stats the week before in a 17-14 victory over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati Bengals</ENAMEX>? So what if the losers outgained the winners, 320 yards to 306? So what if the Bears, whose carnivorous pass rush turned opposing quarterbacks' hair white with terror in their 1985 championship season and for a couple of years thereafter, went sackless?
``We showed patience and discipline,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ditka</ENAMEX>, whose newfound gravity was underscored by sideline attire that included both belt and suspenders. ``I'm proud of that.''
You probably get the idea by now that the 1989 Bears are different from their recent, beastly predecessors and, from appearances, they are. For starters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QB Tomczak</ENAMEX> does not go about off-field sporting spiked hair and wrap-around sunglasses like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Mcmahon</ENAMEX>, the man he replaced by virtue of the latter's late exile/trade for draft choices unknown to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>. For reserves (and a few starters, too), 26 of the 47 men currently wearing bruinish black (very dark blue, actually) are in their fourth season or less, meaning that they saw the team's Super Bowl triumph on TV, if at all.
But if the look is new, the ways are familiar to the gang that won the past five <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFC Central Division</ENAMEX> titles and was the league's winningest unit in that span. ``Oh, yeah, we've got a lot of new faces -- just look around you,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Singletary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> veteran middle linebacker and defensive leader, gesturing at the smiling countenances atop the unclothed bods in the Bears locker room post-fray. ``But I think most of them have got the idea pretty well.''
If the Bears hadn't they wouldn't be 2-0 after games with a couple teams some thought would knock them off. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bengals</ENAMEX>, their week-one foe, were a narrow Super Bowl loser to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 49ers in January, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX> were picked by many to appear in that august struggle this time around. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesotans</ENAMEX> were slight point-spread favorites Sunday, no small honor in a league in which the humblest home team usually gets a betting bow.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikes</ENAMEX>' cast included nine last-season Pro Bowlers, and I ain't talkin' ten pins. Their premier passing combo of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade Wilson</ENAMEX> to squirmy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Carter</ENAMEX> may be the game's best if you don't count <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Fran</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Montana</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Rice</ENAMEX>. They beat the Bears three times last year, if you do count a pre-season tilt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>. They spindled the formidable-appearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houston Oilers</ENAMEX>, 38-7, in their opener last week.
Throughout a Sunday first half made tedious in part by a couple of long delays for those awful TV reviews of field-officials' decisions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikings</ENAMEX> gave about as good as they got. The Bears scored first on a 51-yard, first-period drive capped when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Anderson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Payton</ENAMEX>'s worthy successor at running back, caught a 24-yard pass and crawled into the end zone before a Viking could pin him down. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikes</ENAMEX> got even in quarter two on a Wilson-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Gustafson</ENAMEX> pass, and although a field goal gave Chicago a 10-7 halftime edge the visitors led in every important yardage category.
In the second half, though, a couple of bad things happened to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minny</ENAMEX>. The first was a missed field goal by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Garcia</ENAMEX> from 33 yards early in quarter three that would have meant a tie. The other came on a 22-yard pass play from Tomczak to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Suhey</ENAMEX>, a stumpy, graying fullback in his 10th season, that set up the fourth-period TD that finally gave the Bears some leeway. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomczak</ENAMEX> was rushed hard and threw the ball up for grabs. Suhey looked back before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Studwell</ENAMEX>, the linebacker who was covering him, and grabbed it at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> two yard-line. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> scored from there to make it 17-7.
``I hung it up for Matt because he's an older guy and needs more time to run his route,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomczak</ENAMEX> quipped. The joke worked only because the pass did.
From there, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikes</ENAMEX> simply collapsed. On the second play after the next kickoff, Bear linebacker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Rivera</ENAMEX> intercepted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> pass to set up a touchdown drive. Cornerback <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lemuel Stinson</ENAMEX> intercepted on the first Viking play after that and ran it in from 29 yards. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rookie</ENAMEX> halfback <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Green</ENAMEX> scored from 37 yards on his first carry as a Bear in his team's last possession.
``It was embarrassing. We played atrocious,'' fumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Millard</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> defensive lineman. The information that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ditka</ENAMEX> had commented that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vikes</ENAMEX> might not lose again until Dec. 3, the next time the two teams meet, didn't soothe. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ditka</ENAMEX>'s a sarcastic person. I don't take him serious,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millard</ENAMEX> said. He didn't say anything about statistics.
