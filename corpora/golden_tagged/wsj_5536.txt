<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco Pictures Inc.</ENAMEX> said the company and certain of its officers plan to purchase additional shares of its 48%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, in the wake of the murders last month of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live's</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Menendez</ENAMEX>, and his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitty</ENAMEX>.
The announcement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX>, which contained no specifics about how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX> shares would be purchased or when, seemed designed to bolster the company's stock price, which has plummeted from a recent high of $25 a share to around $15 a share since the murders.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> greeted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolco</ENAMEX>'s announcement yesterday with only lukewarm enthusiasm. In national over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX> shares edged up 50 cents to close at $15.50. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> shares climbed 12.5 cents to close at $9.75 a share.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX>, which finances, produces and leases motion pictures, said that among the officers who would be purchasing shares of Live in the open market is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Hoffman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive and acting chairman and CEO of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Van Nuys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, distributor and retailer of video and audio software.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> believes that the stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX> is greatly undervalued at this time,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Kassar</ENAMEX>, co-chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kassar</ENAMEX> has been negotiating to buy a 36% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> from co-chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Vajna</ENAMEX>, but those negotiations have been modified as a result of the drop in share prices.
Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX> weren't available to elaborate on yesterday's announcement.
Since Mr. and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menendez</ENAMEX> were found shot to death in their <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> mansion on Aug. 20, questions have been raised about possible links between the murders and organized crime. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX> bought two companies from individuals identified by law enforcement officials as having alleged ties to organized crime. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX> has maintained that the killings weren't related to organized crime, and the company has hired a law firm to investigate whether there was any link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live's</ENAMEX> operations and the murders.
