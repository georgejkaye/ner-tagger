<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> unveiled a wide-ranging cooperation accord apparently aimed at reinforcing their mutual market positions ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western European</ENAMEX> airline deregulation.
In announcing the pact, which they termed a ``commercial agreement,'' the two carriers said they will begin talks with the Spanish state airline Iberia about reaching a similar accord.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> said the commission ``certainly will be looking for notification'' of the terms of the agreement ``so we'll know for sure whether it raises questions'' in the field of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> antitrust law.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> announced they will look for ways to work together in cargo, pilot training, aircraft acquisitions, marketing, catering and duty-free sales. Sharing of traffic rights on some joint flights wasn't ruled out, but cross-shareholdings were. The carriers stressed that the accord ``doesn't exclude any alliances with other airlines in the world,'' and they claimed it will result in benefits for consumers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Attali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> chairman, dismissed any potential problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> competition law. ``It's our right to work with a privileged partner,'' he said. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinz Ruhnau</ENAMEX> said he doesn't foresee any need to seek the blessing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> for such joint activities.
