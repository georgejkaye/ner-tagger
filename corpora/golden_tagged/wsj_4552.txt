IN THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PREDAWN</ENAMEX> ON SEPT. 25, 1967, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cunard Line</ENAMEX>'s Queen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, outbound from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, passed her sister ship the Queen Elizabeth heading west. The floodlighted ships exchanged salutes. For the Mary, it was farewell. Another great trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic liner</ENAMEX> was headed for oblivion.
The midocean salute was one more sign of the inevitable. In 1958, the year the first jetliner took off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, airplanes had carried more trans-Atlantic passengers than ships. By 1965, when 4.3 million people crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, only 714,000, or 17%, went by sea.
The Mary would end up as a floating hotel in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Beach</ENAMEX> harbor. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Elizabeth</ENAMEX> would die a fiery hulk in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> on her way to a scrap yard. Even without the 80,000-ton <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queens</ENAMEX>, however, the liner lived on. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunard</ENAMEX> launched the 67,000-ton <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Queen Elizabeth II</ENAMEX> in 1969 and she still makes scheduled trans-Atlantic runs. (Currently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">QE II</ENAMEX> is on lease in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Osaka</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, as a hotel and shopping mall.)
The pleasure cruise saved the big ships. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cunard</ENAMEX> had tried a prototype in 1948, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caronia</ENAMEX>, designed to sail any ocean with such features as a permanent outdoor swimming pool. Today the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cruise Line International Association</ENAMEX> counts 191 ships (105 operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>), with 122,000 berths, an average of almost 650 per ship. The new flagships are approaching the old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queens</ENAMEX> in size. Royal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>'s Sovereign of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seas</ENAMEX> displaces 74,000 tons and even bigger cruise ships are coming.
The American flag, however, flies on only two lines (one for river steamers). The U.S. let its passenger ships go by default. In 1965, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBJ</ENAMEX>'s maritime commissioner called U.S. liners ``the only subsidized luxury in American industry.'' The world's biggest operator, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX>, is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> but its seven ships fly foreign flags.
The cruise operators see only clear sailing ahead. Last year, almost 3.2 million Americans boarded cruise ships -- barely 2% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> population.
