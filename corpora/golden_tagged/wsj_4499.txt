<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puget Sound Bancorp</ENAMEX> said it will post a third-quarter loss of about $5 million after increasing its loan-loss reserves by $20.5 million to cover potential losses on real estate loans in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tacoma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, bank holding company posted net income of $11.3 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puget Sound</ENAMEX> said the action was mandated by a recent downturn in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> real estate market, where it has $57.6 million in commercial real estate loans outstanding, and in further declines in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> market, where its loan exposure amounts to $48 million.
