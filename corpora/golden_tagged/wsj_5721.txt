<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Gotlieb</ENAMEX>, former Canadian ambassador to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, writing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> 31, 1989 edition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe & Mail</ENAMEX> newspaper, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>:
It is an astounding paradox that the American people return a congressional slate almost totally unchanged from election to election, while clamoring for ``renewal'' and a break with the past when choosing a president. Almost all presidential candidates -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kennedy</ENAMEX> -- run against ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'' or the ``system,'' codewords for an establishment thought to be out of touch with the real <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>. Each new campaign is proclaimed a crusade to liberate the land from the foolish policies of the predecessor president. It is as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is in perpetual revolution.
