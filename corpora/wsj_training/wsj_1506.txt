The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives, government officials said.
The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX>.
The existence of the guidelines has become known since President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> meeting last Monday. Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month's futile effort to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX>.
According to the officials, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> discussing the guidelines. They said the president conceded the notification requirement didn't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month's Panama coup effort. No notification was ever considered, officials said, apparently because the U.S. didn't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX>, but merely sought to imprison him.
What's more, both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12, a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules.
However, the disclosure of the guidelines, first reported last night by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>, is already being interpreted on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> as an unfair effort to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> and, more broadly, for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad.
A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okla.</ENAMEX>), charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>. The statement added, ``Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government. Not only does this come close to a violation of law, it violates the trust we have all worked to develop.''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> said, ``It's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future. I've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee.''
Republican Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>, the panel's vice chairman, said of the disclosure that ``a text torn out of context is a pretext, and it is unfair for those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion.''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> said the committee couldn't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules.
But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline wasn't imposed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> by a meddling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Instead, both congressional and administration officials agreed, it grew out of talks about coup-planning in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October.
The guideline wasn't a law, but a joint interpretation of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations. In fact, yesterday the administration and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> were still differing on what had been agreed to. One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. ``gets wind'' of somebody else's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator's life. But a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S.
Although the notification guideline wasn't carried out in this month's coup attempt, some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence and military operatives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>. One senior administration official called the guideline ``outrageous'' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble.
The issue came to a head last year, officials recalled, partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts. In addition, both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign.
Though the assassination ban is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> order that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> never voted on, the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation. Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster</ENAMEX> publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups.
The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for restrictions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said have hampered its freedom of action. However, last week Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s two top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> deputies said congressional curbs hadn't hampered the spy agency's role in the coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>.
Nevertheless, the administration's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president. The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines, without changing the basic assassination ban, to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders.
The new argument over the notification guideline, however, could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed.
