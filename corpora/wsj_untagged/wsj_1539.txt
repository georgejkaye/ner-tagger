Scimed Life Systems Inc., Minneapolis, said a federal appeals court vacated an earlier summary judgment in its favor.
A lower court in St. Paul had ruled in September 1988 that a heart catheter Scimed manufactures doesn't infringe on a patent owned by Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, a unit of Eli Lilly & Co.
Scimed said the appeals court remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings. In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Scimed shares tumbled $2.75 to $43.
Scimed said it ``remains committed'' both to the ``vigorous defense'' of its position that the catheter doesn't infringe the Lilly unit's patent, and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims, which allege Lilly engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts.
