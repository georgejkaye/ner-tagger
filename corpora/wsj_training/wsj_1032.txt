<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beghin-Say S.A.</ENAMEX> said that it plans to sell its remaining paper operations by the end of January as part of a drive to refocus on the food sector and lower its debt.
The French unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria</ENAMEX> also disclosed a 40% rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989, excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beghin-Say</ENAMEX> said the sale will be done in two parts and will raise a total of 2.025 billion francs ($325 million).

The West German paper company entered the venture in April 1988 by acquiring a 50% stake, also from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beghin</ENAMEX>-Say.
The other part of the transaction will see Beghin-Say sell its 50% stake in its Kaysersberg paper affiliate to an unspecified unit of the petrochemical group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montedison S.p. A.</ENAMEX>, which is also controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX>.
And in a separate transaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beghin-Say</ENAMEX> will sell its remaining 25% interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">A.T.B.</ENAMEX>, a holding company for international trading assets, to an unspecified unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> for 258 million francs.
