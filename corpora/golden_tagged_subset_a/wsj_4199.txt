Mexican President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> is getting the red-carpet treatment during his coming state visit with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. He begins with a special visit to Camp <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">David</ENAMEX> on Sunday and finishes up with an address to a joint session of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on Wednesday. From the beginning, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> has received special attention from President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> was one of the first foreign leaders received by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> last November. The positive character of that first meeting -- dubbed the ``Spirit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>'' -- continues to inspire a post-nuptial glow. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> was the first nation to receive help under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady Plan</ENAMEX>. What gives here? Tex-Mex presidential chemistry doesn't explain it all.
In fact, the Bush-Salinas honeymoon is the tip of the iceberg. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> is a man with a world view, a modern globalist. He entertains U.S. presidents and Japanese prime ministers in an effort to insert <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> advantageously in the world market. As a consequence, U.S.-Mexican relations are on the verge of a profound reconceptualization -- from distant neighbors to global economic partners. The partnership implies ever greater North American economic integration, propelled by the emergence of global trading blocs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Basin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> will reap the benefits of proximity to the largest market in the world, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> will enhance its own competitiveness in global markets.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> has spent his first 10 months in office implementing his strategy. Despite the noisy opposition of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s anachronistic left, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> has instituted trade liberalization, new foreign-investment regulations, the deregulation of transportation, the announced sale of state enterprises (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexicana Airline</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cananea</ENAMEX> Copper, Diesel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National and Telefonos</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>), and a partial opening of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s sacrosanct petroleum industry to private and foreign investment. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s domestic debt remains oppressive, and further privatizations in the steel, fertilizer and banking sectors would enhance investor confidence. Nonetheless, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> is to be applauded as he coaxes a skittish private sector to jump through his window of opportunity.
For veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>-watchers accustomed to conflict-ridden summits, the clear sailing is refreshing. Instead of snarling over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX> and drugs, participants are placing economic policy considerations at the top of the summit's agenda. In particular, the economic agenda of the summit will be paramount. In particular, the economic discussions will be shaped by the fact that banks seem inclined to select the principal and interest reduction options of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady Plan</ENAMEX>, reducing the likelihood of large sums of fresh money flowing to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>. This, in turn, pushes trade and investment to center stage.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mosbacher</ENAMEX> can be expected to make final the details of his personal involvement in an investment-promotion program for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Trade Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> will push trade negotiations in the areas of autos, electronics, steel, textiles and intellectual property. After his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> meetings, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> will travel to promote his vision of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> business establishment, hoping to compensate with direct investment the anticipated shortage in fresh credit.
The jarring note in this symphony is the sobering thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s historic economic experiment rests on a fragile political base. It is easy to forget that only 10 months ago, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> took office amid massive demonstrations and cries of election fraud. A worried U.S. contemplated possible political instability, anti-Yankee sentiment and resurgent populism as opposition leftists challenged the 60-year rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Revolutionary Party</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PRI</ENAMEX>). Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> still faces a choir of leftist intellectuals who are wedded to revolutionary nostalgia, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s poor still reel from six years of no net economic growth. These problems explain the hurried pace of this <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-Mexican honeymoon.
Building stable democratic institutions after 60 years of authoritarian rule is reminiscent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumpelstiltskin</ENAMEX>'s task of trying to spin a roomful of straw into golden threads. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reptilian PRI</ENAMEX> hacks and wild-eyed populists compete with young PRI reformers and earnest conservative opposition-party democrats. The young president has removed corrupt labor leaders, business scions, drug lords and government officials. He also has accepted a historic first gubernatorial victory by an opposition party, the conservative party of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Action</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PAN</ENAMEX>) in the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baja California</ENAMEX>. However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> has little time to spin his straw into gold.
The Mexican political calendar places mid-term elections in 1991. Thus, the summiteers are keeping one eye on the clock, eager to build on encouraging economic signs throughout 1990. So far, the news has been good, as Mexican economic growth for the second semester of 1989 may surpass the 2.4% annualized rate achieved in the first half of the year. However, if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> is unable to deliver real, sustained growth, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> could commit hara-kiri at the polls. The historic experiment in economic partnership could end abruptly. Trust a Texan president to realize that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> is critical to the stability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> southern frontier. So, don't expect splashy agreements to emerge from this summit -- expect substance. And don't underestimate the stakes involved in the first full-dress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>-Salinas meeting.
