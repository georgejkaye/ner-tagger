<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netframe Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> introduced three computers aimed at helping businesses satisfy their growing desire to assemble personal computers in networks.
``They are first in a new niche that could potentially be very significant,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas A. Cayne</ENAMEX>, an analyst at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gartner Group</ENAMEX>, a market-research firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stamford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netframe</ENAMEX>'s computers, which range in price from $22,500 to more than $45,000, enable users of personal computers to share files and data and send messages to one another. Somewhat more expensive minicomputer or server systems sold by companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> perform similar tasks, but these machines aren't designed to work easily with the kinds of software required by personal computers.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cayne</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netframe</ENAMEX> has ``hit on the missing link'' in blending minicomputer power with personal-computer software.
Nevertheless, the company faces a crowded market. Besides competition from minicomputer makers, the company will square off with makers of high-powered personal computers. Many businesses today outfit such machines with communications software to run their networks.
However, analysts said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netframe</ENAMEX>'s approach to networking appears superior because it uses some of the techniques for sending information around networks that far more expensive and powerful mainframe computers use.
``The result is a very viable technical solution that's going to avoid data blocks,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stella Kelly</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infocorp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Clara</ENAMEX> market researcher.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netframe</ENAMEX> has received investments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olivetti</ENAMEX>, the Italian computer maker.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Enzo Torresi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netframe</ENAMEX>'s chief executive officer and a co-founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Businessland Inc.</ENAMEX>, said the company has raised a total of $17 million in private investments, including $12 million in February.
The company's machines, which will be available beginning in November, use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX>'s 80386 and new 80486 microprocessors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Businessland Inc.</ENAMEX>, which has offices in 50 major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> metropolitan areas, will sell the computers.
