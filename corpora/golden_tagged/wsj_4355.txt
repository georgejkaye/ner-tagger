<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton Group S.p. A.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX>, said consolidated net income dropped 12% to 54.7 billion lire ($39.9 million) in the first half of 1989 from 62.4 billion lire a year earlier.
The casual wear company blamed the decline in earnings on narrower profit margins resulting from ``an attentive pricing policy aimed at increasing and maintaining market share.'' It also blamed a change in the schedule of merchandise shipments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> said it will compensate for these problems in the second half so it can maintain its ``high level of profitability'' for all of 1989.
The drop in earnings came despite a 19% rise in consolidated sales to 836 billion lire from 702 billion lire a year earlier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> said it expects full-year sales to reach 1.7 trillion lire, up 15% from 1.475 trillion lire a year earlier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benetton</ENAMEX> also said that based on orders received for next year, it expects ``satisfactory results'' in 1990.
