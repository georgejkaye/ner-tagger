When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk Kerkorian</ENAMEX> agreed to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Group</ENAMEX> for $1.5 billion Friday, it was viewed as one of his shrewdest deals yet -- and the apparent end of an unusual last-minute bidding war between two Australian moguls, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Skase</ENAMEX>.
But the sale has left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> buzzing with questions about how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> engineered the final bidding. People familiar with the bidding say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Inc.</ENAMEX> subsidiary complain they were led to believe that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> bid of $1.4 billion would be accepted quickly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> board.
It also isn't yet clear how Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Group</ENAMEX>, an Australian operator of resorts and a large Australian television network, is going to pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\, one of the oldest movie studios.
On Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> announced it had reached a revised agreement with Qintex to sell the company for $25 a share, or a total of $1.5 billion. That topped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s surprise bid on Wednesday of $23.16 a share, or $1.4 billion, and an earlier Qintex agreement in March to buy the company for $20 a share, or about $1.1 billion.
Analysts say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX>, who has now signed a binding agreement to sell his 82% stake to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qintex</ENAMEX>, has once again managed to get a hefty premium for one of his assets. ``It's a new high benchmark,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Kassan</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> is ``paying 13 to 14 times a best-case cash flow. It's a very high price.''
This won't be the first time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> has come out ahead after buying Metro-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldwyn</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayer</ENAMEX> 20 years ago. Since then he has sold, repurchased and resold pieces of the studio, augmenting his fortune.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> began trying to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\ some 18 months ago, and a long list of companies expressed an interest, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis Cos.</ENAMEX>, controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX>. But many of those who negotiated with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> said he frequently vacillated over what he was willing to sell. He also seemed determined to hold on to the famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM lion</ENAMEX> logo.
Sources say Qintex wanted to buy the whole company but was rebuffed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX>. In March, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> agreed to sell the company to Qintex but only on the condition that he could buy back certain MGM assets, such as the logo, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> library of 34 films and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> television group, among other things -- making the effective purchase price for Qintex about $600 million.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> soon became rife with rumors that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> was having difficulty raising the money. And although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> announced that it had bank commitments of $400 million and was negotiating with equity partners, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> became nervous. He also began to consider, once again, selling the company as a whole. Outsiders speculate he may have become less optimistic about running <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> as a small studio at a time when many independent movie producers are failing.
But sources say it was primarily his nervousness over the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> to come up with the financing that led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\ to reopen talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Inc.</ENAMEX>
In March, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s companies lost out to Qintex after bidding $19.80 a share. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> agreement gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\ the right to terminate the pact if it accepted a higher bid. ``Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> was going to ask for more money {for the whole company}, he wanted a solid buyer,'' says a person close to the negotiations.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said: ``The merger agreement allowed us to continue our discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> and, given the nature of the entertainment community, we were often in contact with them.'' Other officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> declined to comment. Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Inc.</ENAMEX> also declined to comment.
People close to the negotiations say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Inc.</ENAMEX> were led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\ to believe that if they made an offer at an agreed upon price, the acquisition would be assured. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> officials ``were invited to bid. They were told that their {$23.16-a-share} bid had been accepted. They were told that if they made a deal by {a certain} date, the company would be theirs,'' says one insider.
``We thought we had it,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> said in an interview with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. Although he indicated that he would be flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> to meet with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> said: ``We aren't going to pay $26 a share.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Evans</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX>, which is affiliated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Group</ENAMEX>, says that after announcing the Fox offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\ invited Qintex to participate in a bid.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skase</ENAMEX> apparently managed to allay Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX>'s fears about his financing by disclosing more details about his negotiations with potential equity partners. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> also agreed to deliver an irrevocable letter of credit for $50 million as part of the final agreement.
To finance the bid, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> expects to increase its previously announced bank commitments of $400 million and is continuing to negotiate with ``substantial companies with clout'' overseas about equity partnerships. He ``doubts very much'' that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> will sell any part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\ to help finance the acquisition.
Analysts point out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> is assuming $400 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\ debt in the transaction. And they add that the movie business requires big cash outlays.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> will receive roughly $1.2 billion from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> for his stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX>, including the 10 million preferred shares he holds. He controls almost all of the preferred shares, for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex</ENAMEX> is paying $18 a share. On Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> shares closed at $22.625, up $1.875, in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
