The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> said it filed a lawsuit seeking more than $7.7 million from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith Corp.</ENAMEX> unit on charges that the company defrauded the government on a contract to provide relocation services for federal employees.
The suit, filed in federal trial court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Des Moines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith</ENAMEX> is based, alleges that the diversified media company's relocation unit cheated the government by misrepresenting the value of government employees' homes. The government contract required <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith Relocation Corp.</ENAMEX> to purchase employees' homes based on independent appraisals. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> alleges that the company ``engaged in various forms of misrepresentation'' with the goal of reducing the appraised value of employees' homes.
In the suit, the department seeks to recover $7.7 million in costs incurred when the government terminated its contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith Relocation</ENAMEX> and sought other contracts to replace it. The department also said it seeks ``three times the government's damages, which are presently undetermined, plus penalties.''
Officials with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith</ENAMEX> didn't have any immediate comment on the suit.
