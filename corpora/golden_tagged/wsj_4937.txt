<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin Group</ENAMEX>, in a move that will make it the world's largest tire maker, agreed to buy Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich Tire Co.</ENAMEX> for $690 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>, the secretive French company that last year lost a bidding war for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridgestone Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, will achieve two long-sought goals: it will replace longtime rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.</ENAMEX> as the world's biggest tire concern, a useful marketing claim in the highly competitive tire business, and it will shore up its position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the world's biggest tire market.
And while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodyear</ENAMEX> remains the largest tire maker in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, the added clout of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> will make No. 2 Uniroyal Goodrich a more formidable competitor.
The combination would result in a company with world-wide annual sales of $10.3 billion, outstripping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodyear</ENAMEX>'s $7.93 billion annual sales, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Stoyer</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Tire Dealer Magazine</ENAMEX>, a trade publication for North American retail tire dealers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin Group</ENAMEX>'s revenue for 1988 was 51.82 billion francs ($7.89 billion). For the first half of 1989, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> reported profit of 1.46 billion francs on revenue of 28.47 billion francs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridgestone</ENAMEX>, which paid $2.6 billion for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Firestone</ENAMEX>, is the world's third-biggest tire company.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> purchase is the latest in a series of acquisitions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> by French companies. Last week the state-owned chemical giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc S.A.</ENAMEX> bought some operations from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Corp.</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ Corp.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>, for a total of $1.5 billion. Late last year the French state group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pechiney S.A.</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triangle Corp.</ENAMEX>, the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American National Can Co.</ENAMEX>, for $1.26 billion, to become the world's biggest can maker.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> acquisition marks the latest inroad by a foreign tire maker into the important North American market. In recent years <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pirelli S.p. A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armstrong Tire & Rubber Co.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Tire & Rubber Co.</ENAMEX>, in addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridgestone</ENAMEX> purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firestone</ENAMEX>.
For Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodrich</ENAMEX>, long considered a retread in the tire business, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> marriage can only enhance its position. Under the purchase agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> will assume $810 million of Uniroyal debt. Uniroyal also is expected to benefit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>'s research and development prowess.
``We were leveraged. It would have been difficult to spend the kind of money we needed to spend over a long period in order to be in the forefront,'' commented <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin H. Dubilier</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clayton & Dubilier Inc.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> buy-out firm took control of Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodrich</ENAMEX> in 1988, two years after it was formed as a joint venture between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal Tire</ENAMEX> and the tire business of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.F. Goodrich Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal</ENAMEX>, which is trying to become a bigger player in the high-performance tire market, recently embarked on a $650 million to $700 million five-year capital spending program to upgrade its plants. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> said it intends to ``augment'' that capital investment plan.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>, the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal Goodrich</ENAMEX> provides entry into private-label and associate-label tire markets, from which it had been absent. Most makers other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> had long sold tires to other companies that then marketed them under their own names. It also gives it a stronger footing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, which comprises 40% to 45% of the $45 billion non-Communist world tire market. Nearly overnight, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> would gain more than 25% of the North American tire market, up from 10% to 12%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> said it intends to maintain Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodrich</ENAMEX> as a wholly-owned subsidiary under present management, and keep the unit's headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Akron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>. Uniroyal would continue to make and sell tires under its brand name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> said. The acquisition would give the French company 31,000 employees in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> in 11 plants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, five in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and two in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>.
The move into the U.S. follows recent efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> to expand in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>, where its market share is about 3%. Last year it entered into a joint tire-making venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Okamoto Industries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. In 1987 it linked up in separate ventures with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siam Cement Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wuon Poong International Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> last year bought the airplane tire-making business of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.F. Goodrich</ENAMEX> for an undisclosed amount. This gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> a 20% share of the airplane tire market, and represented <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodrich</ENAMEX>'s withdrawal from tires, after it had sold its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal Goodrich</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clayton & Dubilier</ENAMEX>.
NOTE: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>\ assumes a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>'s 40,000 tires a day capacity with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal\</ENAMEX>'s 132,000 tires a day
