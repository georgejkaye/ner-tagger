<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plains Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> said that it might have to pay a $13 million refund to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KN Energy Inc.</ENAMEX> if a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> opinion is upheld.
Last week, the appeals court overturned a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX> order which allowed producers like Plains to renegotiate higher prices for natural gas produced from older natural gas wells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plains</ENAMEX> said it and other natural gas producers will appeal the decision.
After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FERC</ENAMEX> order was issued in 1986, Plains renegotiated its price with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KN</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakewood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, energy concern. As a result, Plains now receives about $1.74 per million British thermal unit, instead of the regulated maximum price of 58 cents per BTU.
Plain said that if it loses the legal battle, the refund will be a ``short-term setback.'' Under contracts it has with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KN, Plains</ENAMEX> said it would receive a much higher price for gas produced from newer wells if the price paid for the older gas is reduced. As a result of the decision, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plains</ENAMEX> said it will increase its drilling program in the Hugoton Field in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX>, increasing its percentage of new gas produced.
