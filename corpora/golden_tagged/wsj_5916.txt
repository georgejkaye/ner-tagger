<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor Corp.</ENAMEX> said it may spend ``significantly more'' than the 300 million Canadian dollars (US$253 million) it previously estimated it would invest to expand output at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince George</ENAMEX>, British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, pulp and paper mills.
``What we announced was an initial generalized estimate of what we'd have to spend for the minimum enlargement, if we do it in phases. It wasn't a firm game plan,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor</ENAMEX> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Bentley</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentley</ENAMEX> said he couldn't provide specific spending figures until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor</ENAMEX>'s board approves the plan early next year. The C$300/NNP million figure, which includes an estimated C$150 million of related environmental improvements, would allow Canfor to raise kraft-pulp output at its two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince George</ENAMEX> mills by about 300 metric tons a day, to a total 1,900 metric tons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor</ENAMEX> ultimately plans to raise daily output to a total 2,600 metric tons. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentley</ENAMEX> said proceeds from the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor</ENAMEX>'s lumber operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Alberta</ENAMEX>, for which the company recently retained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> unit to solicit bids, may be used to help finance spending at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince George</ENAMEX> or other operations, or to reduce debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor</ENAMEX>'s long-term debt rose to C$146.5 million, or about 30% of capital, as of June 30 after its C$93.8 million purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vancouver</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balfour Forest Products Inc.</ENAMEX>
``It {the sale} just enhances our options on what we can do. Not only in terms of timetable or scope at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince George</ENAMEX>, but also in any opportunities we have to integrate {production of} pulp and higher-grade papers,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentley</ENAMEX> wouldn't discuss specifics, but said joint ventures ``could be one way {for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor</ENAMEX>} to get further integrated into the paper business,'' while reducing its risk. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor</ENAMEX> has no plans to boost its interest in newsprint production.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canfor</ENAMEX>'s 50%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Howe Sound Pulp & Paper Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oji Paper Co.</ENAMEX>, is currently spending about C$1 billion to build a newsprint mill and expand pulp output at its facilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Mellon</ENAMEX>, British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>.
