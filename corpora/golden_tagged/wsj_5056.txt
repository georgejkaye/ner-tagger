It's easy to get excited about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surgical Laser Technologies</ENAMEX>, a new issue slated to begin trading on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market this week.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malvern</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>-based company, which develops laser-surgery devices, just reported its first profit, and it holds a patent on a new laser instrument. The company is planning to issue 1.5 million shares in its initial public offering, for $9.50 to $11.50 a share, at a time when laser stocks are one of the hottest industry groups on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>.
Some think the company's timing couldn't be better. ``The next 10 years will be gangbusters for laser companies,'' predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Mutsch</ENAMEX>, a medical technology analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>. ``There are lots of risks, but the potential is exciting.''
Other analysts, however, remain cool. ``There's a hot new laser every year,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Abramowitz</ENAMEX>, a medical technology stock analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</ENAMEX> ``The technology is sexy. But I don't spend much time following the companies.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lasers</ENAMEX> harness the natural energy states of electrons to produce a high-intensity beam of light. Used in surgery, according to manufacturers and doctors, they offer a number of benefits over standard procedures, such as increased precision, faster healing, shorter hospital stays and reduced bleeding, swelling, pain and infection.
Stock prices of laser makers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summit Technology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visx</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taunton Technologies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coherent</ENAMEX> have jumped sharply this year. But many analysts fret that many of the companies don't have steady, reliable streams of revenue because lasers aren't disposable and, therefore, don't generate repeat sales.
``Selling one product to one customer that you never see again isn't much of a business,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Bradsher</ENAMEX>, a medical technology analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambrecht & Quist</ENAMEX>. Disposable products, on the other hand, tend to have good margins, provide steady revenue flow and have more predictable sales patterns, he explains.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, the disappointing results and inherent risks of some laser techniques lead many analysts to wonder whether the industry will live up to investors' expectations.
Just last June, research by one cardiologist cast doubts on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Trimedyne</ENAMEX>'s laser therapy, citing deaths, limb amputations and other complications that occurred after some patients used the treatment. The company said at the time that investors misinterpreted the study's findings, leading to a steep drop in the stock price. Trimedyne finished unchanged at 9 Friday, and is down 54% for the year.
Investor interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Summit Technology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visx</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taunton Technologies</ENAMEX> blossomed last month after an article in this newspaper said the three companies are racing to market a version of a highly specialized laser to correct vision defects.
In its prospectus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surgical Laser Technologies</ENAMEX> says it plans to focus selling its products in such areas as gynecology, general surgery and orthopedics, even though its laser system has been approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> for various other uses.
The company also is working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medtronic</ENAMEX>, another medical devices maker, to develop and obtain regulatory approval of laser catheters for treating heart and limb arteries.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surgical Laser</ENAMEX> says it has a patented ``contact laser system'' that allows surgeons to use the laser instrument directly on the tissue being treated. Doctors using non-contact lasers must hold the devices away from the tissue being treated and attempt to control the laser from a distance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Surgical Laser</ENAMEX>'s system includes a portable unit that transmits the laser energy, as well as interchangeable probes and scalpels. It also has disposable hand pieces and fibers that connect the probes to the energy source, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Greisler</ENAMEX>, a company spokesman. The prospectus states that 42% of the company's revenue since its inception has come from the sale of the disposables and other accessories.
In the year ended Jan. 1, the company's sales totaled $12.2 million. In the six months ended July 2, sales were $10.6 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piper Jaffray</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutsch</ENAMEX> says the projected price is roughly 2.4 times estimated 1989 revenue. That's reasonable for an emerging-growth company, he says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surgical Laser ``</ENAMEX>looks a lot less risky than most'' medical laser companies, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mutsch</ENAMEX> says.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Fosback</ENAMEX>, editor of a newsletter on Ipos based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surgical Laser's</ENAMEX> shares are ``richly priced.'' In the first six months, the company earned $464,000, or 11 cents a share. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fosback</ENAMEX> calculates that, at the current offering-price range, investors will pay roughly 50 times 1989 earnings, based on his estimate of 20 cents a share for the year ending in January. His advice to investors: Wait for a discount to develop after the shares start trading in the open market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BLUE SKIES</ENAMEX> IN THE GOLDEN STATE: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Securities Dealers</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> now exempts Nasdaq's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Market System</ENAMEX> stocks from the state's securities registration requirements known as blue-sky laws. The exemption means that companies whose issues are part of the elite NMS system won't have to meet costly and time-consuming filing requirements before selling shares in the state.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> shares soared 47%, or 10, to 31 1/4, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>'s announcement of a $1.3 billion agreement to acquire the company in a stock swap. Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> would exchange, on a tax-free basis, 0.272 shares of its stock for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> common and Class B share. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> said that based on recent market prices, its offer values <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>'s shares at about $33.15 each.
