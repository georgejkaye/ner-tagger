<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> businessmen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertram M. Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Bynoe</ENAMEX> signed a new agreement to purchase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denver Nuggets</ENAMEX> basketball team, but not as principal owners.
On Saturday, the partners said the team would be purchased for $54 million by a new group including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat Video Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Satellite Corp.</ENAMEX> based here. Comsat Video will pay $17 million for a 62.5% interest, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bynoe</ENAMEX> putting up $8 million for a 37.5% stake in the team. Under terms of the sale, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuggets</ENAMEX> owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Shlenker</ENAMEX> could receive up to $11 million in additional payments from the franchise's future earnings.
Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bynoe</ENAMEX> last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise. But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing.
Comsat Video is headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wussler</ENAMEX>, who resigned his No. 2 executive post with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX> just two weeks ago to take the Comsat position. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat Video</ENAMEX>, which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms, plans to add Nuggets games to their offerings, as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> did successfully with his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> Hawks and Braves sports teams. Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bynoe</ENAMEX> will manage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuggets</ENAMEX>' day-today affairs.
