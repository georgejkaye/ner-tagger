<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> said third-quarter net income slipped 6.8% from a record year-ago quarter. The decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> posted earnings increases.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX>'s third-quarter net fell to $589 million, or $3.29 a share, from $632 million, or $3.36 a share, a year ago. Sales in the latest quarter rose 2% to $4.25 billion from $4.15 billion a year earlier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> closed at $94.625 a share, up 75 cents, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
A spokeswoman said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that full-year earnings will total about $14.60 a share, compared with last year's record net of $2.4 billion, or $12.76 a share. But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $3.44 a share, or $635 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> would earn $14.85 a share for the year if it equaled that year-ago fourth-quarter performance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> officials were signaling that the company would earn less than $15 a share this year even before they announced in July a plan to acquire 67% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marion Laboratories Inc.</ENAMEX> That acquisition could further dilute earnings per share this year, the company spokeswoman said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> hasn't said exactly what impact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marion</ENAMEX> acquisition will have on 1989 earnings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors, including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals, a slower U.S. economy and a stronger dollar, which made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX>'s exports from the U.S. more expensive to overseas customers. Another problem was a 7% increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only 2%.
For the first nine months of the year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> earned $2.06 billion, or $11.41 a share, up 17% from $1.76 billion, or $9.32 a share, a year ago. Sales for the latest nine months rose 7.7% to $13.34 billion from $12.38 billion in the year-ago period.
