The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX>'s earthquake coverage drew attention to a phenomenon that deserves some thought by public officials and other policy makers. Private relief agencies, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salvation Army</ENAMEX> and Red Cross, mobilized almost instantly to help people, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> bureaucracy ``took hours getting into gear.'' One news show we saw yesterday even displayed 25 federal officials meeting around a table. We recall that the mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX> complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy's response to Hurricane Hugo. The sense grows that modern public bureaucracies simply don't perform their assigned functions well.
