The financial problems of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX> are nearly five times greater than previously estimated by the Reagan administration, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, which put the blame largely on mismanagement.
In testimony before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> subcommittee yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bowsher</ENAMEX>, comptroller general and head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>, repeatedly pointed to administrative problems by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>, which runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX>, said the agency sustained a fiscal 1988 loss of $858 million. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> figure, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowsher</ENAMEX> said, ``is far less serious than the $4.2 billion loss as determined by the independent audit.'' The audit, which was done by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX>, was the first audit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX> in 15 years.
``In terms of its direct effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX>'s financial condition, the most critical weakness was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s monitoring of functions involving large amounts of money delegated to third parties,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowsher</ENAMEX> said.
An example of this, he told the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Harrell</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince Georges County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX>, independent closing agent, who was dubbed ``Robin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'' after she admitted taking $5 million from the sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> properties. She said she gave the money to the poor.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> report is additional evidence of mismanagement at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce</ENAMEX>'s two terms as secretary. For the past five months, accusations of political favoritism and lax internal controls have been made in government reports and congressional hearings on the federal housing scandal.
The FHA problems ``are the same fundamental accounting and financial management problems that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> and the {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>} inspector general have been reporting on since the early 1980s,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowsher</ENAMEX> said.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the subcommittee, said, ``Those eight years of mismanagement, neglect, abuse and hostility produced a bitter harvest that we now are beginning to reap.'' He added that ``inadequacies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX>'s accounting system'' prevented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> from completing an audit since 1974. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> abandoned attempts to audit the agency in 1981 and 1984.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowsher</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FHA</ENAMEX> financial books ``were so bad'' it was ``virtually impossible'' to conduct an audit before improvements were made to the agency's accounting system following a 1984 management study.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Demery</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX> commissioner from October 1986 to March 1989, acknowledged in an interview about having some management difficulties, but he placed most of the blame on economic forces over which the administration had no control. ``It was not management or lack thereof,'' he said, ``but premiums went way down while claims and losses went way up'' primarily because of a declining economy in the oil-producing states of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowsher</ENAMEX> said his staff is getting cooperation from the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> secretary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin Fitts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX> commissioner. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitts</ENAMEX> told the committee the ``losses have been extremely heavy,'' but added the problems are manageable and fixable.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitts</ENAMEX> cited a number of changes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> is making to improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FHA</ENAMEX>, and said department officials are considering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>'s recommendations to create the positions of chief financial officer within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> and comptroller within FHA to carry out a corrective plan.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitts</ENAMEX> said that while there is no evidence of a deliberate cover-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX>'s financial condition by previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials, there is a ``culture'' at the agency that brings ``a reluctance to face losses... because nobody wants to deliver the bad news.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> did endorse a heavily debated proposal to raise the ceiling on FHA loans. Such a move, which has been opposed by some groups as harmful to the provision of low-income housing, would lower FHA claim rates and boost FHA revenue, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowsher</ENAMEX>.
