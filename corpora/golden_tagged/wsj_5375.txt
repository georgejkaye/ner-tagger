Would You Buy a Car
From This Woman?
CAR SELLING isn't the man's world it once was.
In part to appeal to women buyers, auto dealers say they are starting to add more women to their ranks. The number of saleswomen enrolled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Automobile Dealers Association</ENAMEX>'s ownership training school has more than doubled in the past five years, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Mccarthy</ENAMEX>, the group's executive vice president.
``Car dealers are no longer the good ol' boys who sit around and drink coffee, read the paper and smoke cigarettes,'' he says.
A few years back, women started complaining about condescending salesmen who assumed that female buyers cared only about the car's color, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccarthy</ENAMEX> says. Recognizing that about 45% of new car purchases are made directly by women and another 30% are influenced by them, some dealers figured one way to attract female buyers was to add more women to the sales force.
Car saleswomen, of course, also sell to men, and they tend to use different tactics than salesmen, according to a study by sociologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helene Lawson</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loyola University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. While observing and interviewing 45 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-area saleswomen and men, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> found that some women ``take on roles men expect of them -- the matronly grandmother or mother -- or they act silly or'dizzy.'''
Not all customers respond well to car saleswomen, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> says. Some men, especially older ones, simply won't buy a car from a woman, she says. ``They'll try to stump the female salesperson by asking tough technical questions they wouldn't pose to a man,'' she says.
Or they can be rude, asking, ``Where's your father?'' or ``Can I talk to a real salesman?''
Most customers, though, like to find women on the sales floor, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccarthy</ENAMEX> agree. Women, they say, are perceived as less hard sell.
Aluminum-Bat Makers
Are Pitching Overseas
WITH THE U.S. aluminum bat market approaching saturation, some companies are trying to get foreign baseball players hooked on metal right from the start.
Hoping to take advantage of the growth of baseball's popularity overseas -- baseball becomes an official Olympic medal sport in 1992 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jas D. Easton Corp.</ENAMEX> is supplying aluminum bats to national teams in several countries including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Easton</ENAMEX> is running ads in foreign sports publications and sponsoring baseball clinics overseas to sell the sport, as well as aluminum bats.
Other bat makers are also taking a swing at building business overseas. ``It's a boundless new market,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Mcgrath</ENAMEX>, director of international marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hillerich & Bradsby Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hillerich</ENAMEX>, which makes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX> Slugger brand bats, is covering its bases overseas by marketing both aluminum and wooden bats.
Aluminum bat sales have grown to 90% of all bats sold in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, up from 18% in 1973, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Easton</ENAMEX>. But because aluminum bats -- which don't break easily -- aren't replaced as often as wooden ones, the company decided the only way it could boost sales substantially was to expand overseas, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Darby</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easton Sports</ENAMEX> division.
Because many foreigners are just starting to get interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s favorite sport, aluminum bat makers shouldn't have the same problem they face with baseball purists in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Professional ballplayers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> can't use aluminum bats. Metal bats make it easier to hit home runs and artificially raise players' averages, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Small</ENAMEX>, a major league spokesman. What's more, aluminum bats don't provide the same resounding crack that wooden bats do, he says, adding, ``As long as there are trees, we're going to use wooden bats.''
Cartoon Ads Appeal
To Older Generation
ADVERTISERS are discovering that grownups like cartoons as much as kids.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Butterfinger</ENAMEX> candy bar television spot -- featuring the cartoon family the ``Simpsons'' from ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracey Ullman Show</ENAMEX>'' -- ranked in the top 10 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video Storyboard Tests Inc.</ENAMEX>'s first quarter 1989 poll of the most popular ads.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garfield</ENAMEX> the cat for Embassy Suites hotels and the Peanuts gang for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Life Insurance</ENAMEX> were pitchmen in two of the top 12 print ads of 1988, according to a study by Starch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INRA Hooper Inc.</ENAMEX>
In the past, Madison Avenue frequently shied away from comic book characters, believing they appealed only to youngsters, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Vadehra</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video Storyboard.</ENAMEX> ``But their appeal is much stronger than advertisers thought.''
These cartoon characters have more pull than most flesh and blood celebrities, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Starch and Video Storyboard</ENAMEX> found. What's more, a cartoon spokesman isn't as risky as a ``live'' celebrity, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vadehra</ENAMEX>. ``No {cartoon} is going to jump up and say'I never used that product ' like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cybill Shepherd</ENAMEX> did with beef.''
Odds and Ends
BLACK CONSUMERS are less likely than whites to use coupons, shop in department stores and shop by catalog. But they're more apt to shop in convenience stores and order products through TV shopping shows, according to a study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impact Resources</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>.... Watch out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ernest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Julio</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch Cos.</ENAMEX> will promote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelob Dry</ENAMEX>'s new 20-ounce longneck bottle as ``the beer to be shared.'' Touting the beer as an alternative to wine at dinner, TV commercials feature the decorative bottle in an ice-filled bucket.
