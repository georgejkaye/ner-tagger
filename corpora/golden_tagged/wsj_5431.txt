<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest Association Inc.</ENAMEX> is negotiating to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Health magazine</ENAMEX> from its publisher for about $40 million, according to publishing industry executives.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX>, the closely held publishing concern based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pleasantville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, said it has created three new business groups in a restructuring aimed at helping its growth in global publishing and direct-mail industries.
The company, which is currently in preregistration for an initial public offering of non-voting shares of company stock, said it couldn't comment on acquisition activity. But during the last two years, the company has been buying magazines to add to its flagship monthly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX>, which has a U.S. circulation of more than 16 million. Since 1986, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest Association</ENAMEX> has acquired three special interest magazines, Travel-Holiday, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Handyman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Choices</ENAMEX>, formerly known as 50 plus magazine.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Lipstein</ENAMEX>, president and general partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Health</ENAMEX> and the related special interest magazines that form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Health Partners</ENAMEX>, acknowledged that he is discussing a sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Health</ENAMEX>, but declined to identify the buyer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> said the partnership is interested in selling the magazine ``precisely because it's having a good year'' and ``it seemed like a like a good time to have a discussion.'' However, publishing industry executives speculated that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> needs to raise money to pay off investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Health</ENAMEX>, which he started in 1982.
The 38-year old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> also is a general partner in Smart and Psychology Today, and the sole owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Earth News</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> launched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Health</ENAMEX> with $10 million raised from investors by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX> A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer</ENAMEX> said the investment bank is no longer involved in any of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX>'s properties. In recent years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> has worked with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> media investment bankers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veronis Suhler & Associates</ENAMEX>, acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Earth News</ENAMEX> in 1985 for an amount not disclosed and purchasing Psychology Today in 1988 for an estimated $25 million. Earlier this year he and some limited partners launched Smart, a new consumer magazine aimed at men.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> is said to be considering the sale of other magazines, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psychology</ENAMEX> Today, he said the only sale discussions at present concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Health magazine</ENAMEX>. ``I am still left with three essentially strong magazines,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> said he planned to raise $40 million to $50 million in a public offering of his company, which he planned to rename <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New American Magazines</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> said the money raised would be used to pay off investors, but that about $15 million would be used as a start-up fund for new magazines. Yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipstein</ENAMEX> said he is still considering the public offering.
Meanwhile, the realignment at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George V. Grune</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive, represents a ``natural consolidation'' for the company.
The three operating groups will be headed by newly appointed presidents. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. John Bohane</ENAMEX>, 53, vice president and director of U.S. marketing, was named president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Direct Marketing Group</ENAMEX>, responsible for all U.S. direct-mail activities for the company's book, music and home video products and financial services.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth A. Gordon</ENAMEX>, 52, vice president and director of international marketing, was named president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Group</ENAMEX>, responsible for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX> activities outside of the U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Kenney</ENAMEX>, 42, who has headed his own media investment firm, was named president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine Publishing Group</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenney</ENAMEX> will oversee the company's magazines. He was founder and president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas Kenney & Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> media investment company.
