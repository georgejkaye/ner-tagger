Mesa Airlines said the takeover offer it received earlier this week from Stateswest Airlines is for a combination of cash and securities valued by Stateswest at $10 a Mesa share. Both companies are regional carriers in the Southwest.
When it made the offer, Stateswest declined to disclose details and asked Mesa to do the same. But Farmington, N.M.-based Mesa said the offer was for $7 in cash and unspecified Stateswest securities valued at $3 a share. Based on the number of Mesa shares outstanding not already owned by Stateswest, the proposed takeover would have a value of about $15.3 million. Stateswest owns 7.25% of Mesa.
Last week, Mesa rejected a general proposal from Stateswest that the two carriers combine. In response to the specific offer, Gary Risley, Mesa vice president, said management will ask directors to employ a financial consultant to advise them.
