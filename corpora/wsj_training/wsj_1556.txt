Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys: the franchisees.
``When elephants start fighting, ants get killed,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Riese</ENAMEX>, co-owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Restaurants</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> franchisee for Pizza <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Rogers</ENAMEX> and other chains.
As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another, franchisers are struggling desperately for market share, slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions. The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many, threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees.
The chains ``used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow, but in the last year or so, discounting has become a 12-month thing,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Harty</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charisma Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> franchisee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX>'s Burger King chain. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charisma</ENAMEX>'s sales are up slightly this year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harty</ENAMEX> says profits will be flat or lower.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Konopnicki</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Safford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, licensee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's Corp.</ENAMEX> who is chairman of the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Operators Advisory Board</ENAMEX>, says some fast-food outlets ``could be in serious trouble, based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on.''
Until recently, the huge fast-food industry, with sales of about $60.1 billion last year, kept price-skirmishing to a minimum. But early this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Inc.</ENAMEX> slashed prices and stepped up promotions, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rohs</ENAMEX>, an analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim Schroder & Co.</ENAMEX> That brought a chain reaction in the industry.
The situation was further aggravated early this month, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons. It also decided to go national with pizza, which it has been test-marketing.
Now, two-for-one deals on pizza are common; so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high. The discounting, say fast-food operators, occurs on a scale and with a frequency they haven't seen before. The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even, laying off middle managers and working harder to make less.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Mack</ENAMEX>, a district manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cormack Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX>, a Burger King operator in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Neb.</ENAMEX>, says discounting is so prevalent that ``we have to serve 15% to 20% more customers'' to keep sales level. ``It's almost as if you're doing extra work to give away the food,'' he says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan D'Agosto</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panda's Inc.</ENAMEX>, an operator of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s restaurants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>, says: ``All we're doing is keeping the customers coming, but we aren't increasing sales.'' With fast-food outlets on every corner, he, like many, doesn't think he has a choice in the price war: ``Our customers say that they won't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon.''
If the battle continues much longer, many fast-food businesses will close or merge, predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Morrissey</ENAMEX>, who owns a string of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> Fried <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chicken</ENAMEX> stores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>. ``The industry is overbuilt,'' he says. ``Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Restaurant Association</ENAMEX> says quick-service restaurant units in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> rose 14% to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987, the last year for which figures are available. With the market so crowded, says a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, ``If you're doing well, you're doing well at someone else's expense.''
Simply put, there isn't enough business for every store to grow.
According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rohs</ENAMEX>, inflation-adjusted, same-store sales at company-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s units in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989, except for August. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s has also been running negative all year,'' the analyst says.
Spokesmen for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s criticized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rohs</ENAMEX>'s calculations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Greenberg</ENAMEX>, executive vice president and chief financial officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's</ENAMEX>, says the company doesn't compute, much less disclose, inflation-adjusted, same-store sales. He adds that short-term comparisons ``can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year.''
Profit margins at company-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s outlets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> ``are holding up quite nicely,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX>. Profits of franchisees haven't been higher since the mid-1970s, he adds.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX>'s sanguine outlook isn't matched by many fast-food industry observers. Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail, many in the industry predict. Big franchise groups ``can ride out the storm a lot longer,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harty</ENAMEX>, the Burger King operator in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrissey</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Fried Chicken</ENAMEX> franchisee, notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties, or portion of sales, that they must pay franchisers.
Franchisees can't be forced to go along with a franchiser's discounting. But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program, the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lew Rudnick</ENAMEX>, a principal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rudnick & Wolfe</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> law firm with franchise industry clients. He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing.
In any case, many franchisees, in order to stay on good terms with franchisers, routinely go along with promotions. Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riese</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Restaurants</ENAMEX>: ``If you resisted on prices, maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise.
