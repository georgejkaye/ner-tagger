<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahners Publishing Co.</ENAMEX> said it plans a major expansion of its 84-year-old entertainment trade publication Variety, and named a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producer as editor of the weekly and daily editions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahners</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed International PLC</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Bart</ENAMEX>, an independent film producer and author in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, would assume the post in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> as of Oct. 9.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard Byrne</ENAMEX>, executive publisher of Variety, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahners</ENAMEX> is developing an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> version of Daily Variety, the daily newspaper that is a bible of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based film industry. The weekly Variety has a circulation of about 30,000 spread throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> daily would be for the entertainment industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrne</ENAMEX>. ``There are so many vertically integrated companies doing just about everything in media and we should be reaching them.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahners</ENAMEX> acquired Variety from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> family for an estimated $60 million in 1987, and has made it the core of its recently formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Newspapers</ENAMEX> division. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahners</ENAMEX> executives said they will use the division to develop and acquire specialized business newspapers.
Advertising in Variety is expected to reach 3,300 pages this year, up 8% from 1988 but down 7% from 1986, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrne</ENAMEX>. Variety has been hurt by a drop in advertising spending by television syndicators.
Variety has broadened its coverage in recent years to all aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S</ENAMEX> and foreign entertainment. But with a growing number of specialized trade publications serving those markets, Variety has faced increasing competition for both readers and advertisers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahners</ENAMEX> has already made some changes in the old-fashioned newspaper format of Variety. Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cahners</ENAMEX> introduced for the first time four-color pages, editorial photographs, a redesigned front page and higher-quality newsprint.
``At first we regarded the changes in Variety like the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>, we didn't like it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Sabinson</ENAMEX>, director of the League of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Theatres & Producers.</ENAMEX> ``Variety is still as important to the industry as it used to be. We are even becoming used to seeing pictures in it.
