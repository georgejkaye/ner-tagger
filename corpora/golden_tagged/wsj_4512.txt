Corporate raider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul A. Bilzerian</ENAMEX> was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1.5 million on nine felony counts related to his takeover activities.
The sentence is the harshest penalty to come out of the government's Wall Street crackdown, which began with the arrest of investment banker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Levine</ENAMEX> in 1986.
In addition to the prison term, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> was ordered to serve two years on probation while providing 250 hours of community service. The former chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer Co.</ENAMEX>, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> took over in 1988, was convicted in June on charges including securities fraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud and filing false disclosure statements to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>.
In federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Ward</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> could remain free on his own recognizance pending the appeal of his conviction. But the judge ordered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>, who has a net worth of $81.4 million, to pay the fine within 30 days.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>'s attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Mathews</ENAMEX>, had urged the judge not to impose a prison term, arguing that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> was an outstanding citizen who could better serve society through a rigorous community-service program. But the judge said a prison term was necessary. In the course of explaining his sentence, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> accused Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> of lying under oath during the trial.
From the bench, the judge said he had received ``a substantial array of letters and other documents'' praising Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> for his community work and his service as a soldier during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> War. But, the judge said, ``there is another side of the defendant's personality. The lure of money has caused him, an intelligent young man, to lose what I perceive to be proper perspective. In short, he lies.... The case was replete with falsified documents, {including} a tax return that omitted $4 million in income.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David E. Brodsky</ENAMEX>, one of the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorneys in charge of prosecuting the case, called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> ``the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Isuzu</ENAMEX> of corporate takeovers,'' referring to the pathological liar who stars in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Isuzu</ENAMEX> car commercials.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> was convicted of the nine felonies in connection with four different multimillion-dollar stock transactions in 1985 and 1986. His unlawful conduct included concealing the sources of his takeover financing and engaging in rigged  stock trades for the purpose of evading federal income taxes. As part of those schemes, prosecutors said, he submitted false <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> documents, filed false tax returns and exchanged phony invoices with a stockbroker.
At the sentencing, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodsky</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> had ``perverted the purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'' by deliberately disseminating false information about particular stock transactions through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> disclosure documents. None of the charges against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> involved his takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer.</ENAMEX>
New federal sentencing guidelines don't apply to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> because his crimes occurred before the guidelines took effect. But Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> apparently took the guidelines into consideration: The four-year sentence falls in the range of 46 to 57 months that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodsky</ENAMEX> said the defendant would have faced under the guidelines. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodsky</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> would likely serve a third of his sentence before being eligible for release.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>'s attorney, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathews</ENAMEX>, said the sentence was unduly harsh for the types of violations that were found. And in a sentencing memorandum on behalf of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>, he said it would be unfair for his client to serve a longer prison term than defendants convicted of more serious securities-law violations, such as insider trading.
``At its core, this case involves a failure to comply fully and in a timely manner with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> disclosure regulations. There is nothing here akin to theft or breach of fiduciary duty, the type of conduct most associated with insider trading or other securities'fraud' offenses,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathews</ENAMEX> said in the sentencing memorandum. ``The conduct at issue in this case is readily distinguishable from those crimes: It involves no malice and injures no victims.''
The memorandum named several people who were convicted of what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathews</ENAMEX> called more damaging crimes -- yet ended up with lighter sentences. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX>, for instance, is serving a two-year sentence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insider</ENAMEX> trader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan F. Boesky</ENAMEX>, the former stock speculator, was sentenced to three years.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathews</ENAMEX> saved his strongest criticism for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd Jefferies</ENAMEX>, former head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferies & Co.</ENAMEX> brokerage firm and the key witness in the government's case against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferies</ENAMEX> received a suspended sentence, a fine of $250,000 and five years' probation on two felony counts. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathews</ENAMEX>, at the sentencing, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferies</ENAMEX> had ``worked out a deal for a life of misdeeds'' in the securities field.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodsky</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>'s sentence was appropriate. He said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> had expressed no remorse for his crimes and had shown ``arrogance and utter disregard for the legal system,'' while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferies</ENAMEX> had cooperated. ``Bilzerian still maintains that he has done nothing wrong,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brodsky</ENAMEX> said.
In a separate civil suit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> is seeking $31.3 million from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> in alleged illegal profits from several stock transactions from 1985 to 1988. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathews</ENAMEX> said that case will test the government's claims that investors were hurt by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>'s actions. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mathews</ENAMEX> said investors actually benefited from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>'s alleged violations because the takeover strategist's efforts ``shook out the white knights at a premium.
