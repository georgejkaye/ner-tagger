In the bidding war for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating Co.</ENAMEX> raised its proposed offer to one it valued at $2.29 billion from $2.19 billion, apparently topping all other bidders.
The bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s reorganization. They are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization.
Each of the four parties bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state.
The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Yacos</ENAMEX>, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, because the company's stockholders, unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans. In addition, some of the proposals are so close, that non-financial issues such as timing may play a more important role.
The unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Haven</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX>'s new bid. They previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>.
All of the bidders contemplate full payment including interest to secured creditors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX>'s plan, however, offers more for unsecured creditors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Kalmus</ENAMEX>, counsel to the official creditors committee, said that under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> plan, unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about $855 million, accrued before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s Jan. 1988 filing for bankruptcy court protection. In addition, they would receive some $200 million in payments for interest since then. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kalmus</ENAMEX> said that by next July they would have accrued unpaid interest equal to $350 million. Other plans generally wouldn't pay unsecured creditors' interest accrued since the filing.
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX>'s plan, a new holding company would be formed to own the two companies. It would be 72%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> holders and 28%-owned by current holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> preferred and common stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> preferred holders also would get certain debentures and preferred stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> said the preferred holders total package would equal about 60% of their claims. Common shareholders would end up owning about 6.4% of the combined company.
As previously reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast Utilities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, Monday filed a bid it valued at $2.25 billion. That offer was endorsed by the shareholders committee.
The other bidders, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Electric System</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, didn't change the value of their bids, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> changed its rate proposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Electric</ENAMEX> values its offer at $2 billion and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> values its reorganization plan at $2.2 billion.
The bankruptcy judge has ruled that federal bankruptcy laws could be used to circumvent state regulation. However, creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it didn't like.
The state has endorsed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Electric</ENAMEX> plan, which promises to limit rate increases to 4.8% annually for seven years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast Utilities</ENAMEX>' plan proposes 5.5% annual increases.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> amended its plan to call for two years of 5.5% rate increases followed by five years of 4.5% increases. Fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases, however. Previously it had proposed seven years of 5.5% increases.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> also amended its rate plan. The new offer assumes just five years of 5.5% rate increases, to be followed by state-approved increases under the usual hearing procedure. Previously <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating</ENAMEX> had also called for seven years of 5.5% increases.
The bids and rate proposals generally assume the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seabrook</ENAMEX> nuclear power plant, which is completed, will go into operation. Most of the plans have reduced bids in case the plant fails to get a license from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s 17 1/2 debenture due 2004 closed yesterday at $82.50, up $2. The utility's stock closed at $4 a share, up 37.5 cents, in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>.
In a separate development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> gave 60 managers severance agreements that would pay one to three years' salary if their jobs were changed or they were dismissed in the wake of a takeover. It said the maximum cost of the plan would be $9.7 million.
