The state attorney general's office filed suit against five <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> brokerage firms, charging them with responsibility for much of a $200 million loss incurred by the state treasurer's office in 1987.
The suit sets the firms' liability at more than $185 million.
The firms are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Natwest Government Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>
The firms have all said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>'s suit is without merit. On Friday, the firms filed a suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York state</ENAMEX> court asking for a declaratory judgment absolving them of liability. That suit is pending.
The suits relate to a $200 million loss, disclosed in December, that was suffered by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX>'s consolidated investment pool. The pool invested idle cash for many state agencies and local governments.
In its suit, the attorney general's office alleges that brokers encouraged members of the treasurer's office to engage in high-volume, high-risk transactions that benefited the brokers.
