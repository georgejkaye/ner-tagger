<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Andersen & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX> ended merger talks that would have created the biggest worldwide and U.S. accounting firm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence A. Weinbach</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arthur Andersen & Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe Cooperative</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Andersen</ENAMEX>'s world-wide organization, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Connor</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse World Firm</ENAMEX>, said that they scuttled the merger discussions ``because differences couldn't be resolved within a realistic time frame.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX> was under pressure to come up with a merger plan before its annual meeting of 1,227 U.S. partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> Oct. 18-20, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX> faced the same deadline for its annual meeting of 799 U.S. partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> the same week. ``It was just too much pressure for the two of them to solve a long list of economic problems, headed by the differences in their retirement plans,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Emerson</ENAMEX>, publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emerson's Professional Services Review</ENAMEX>, an industry newsletter.
Several sticking points undid the proposed merger. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX>'s retirement plan, which was fully funded, partners receive between $25,000 and $50,000 a year. Price didn't prefund its plan and its partners after retirement receive about $100,000 a year. One benefit consultant said combining the plans would produce a ``hydra-headed monster'' that would be difficult or impossible to administer.
Other hurdles the two firms failed to overcome included the question of which would hold the balance of power, the great disparity in the size and strength of their consulting practices, and the fact that a merger might not gain approval of antitrust regulators.
Another roadblock was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX>'s status as auditor for several major computer-hardware companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCR Corp.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX>, a major computer-systems consultant, has been in joint ventures with such companies. Accounting-profession ethics rules ban business ties with audit clients.
``We are the premier auditor firm in the world, and we aren't going to sacrifice an audit client for some short-term commercial advantage,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn F. O'Malley</ENAMEX>, chairman and senior partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Malley</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX>, while not always able to do huge joint-venture computer installations because of conflict of interest with its audit work, would continue to do systems-strategies, software-installation and tax-software work for clients.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Malley</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX>'s consulting revenues were growing at 28% a year, compared with 20% for tax work and 5%-6% for auditing. ``It's not inconceivable that consulting will wind up to be 30% of our total revenues,'' he said. Currently, 20% cent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX>'s world-wide revenue of $2.2 billion comes from consulting.
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinbach</ENAMEX> said there is ``nothing inconsistent with being the premier computer-systems firm and the premier audit and tax firm at the same time.'' He noted that 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen</ENAMEX>'s world-wide revenues of $2.8 billion derive from consulting, and said that share might rise to 50% in the early 1990s.
Consulting revenue, he said, are growing at 30% a year, compared with 10% for auditing and about 15% in tax work. ``We believe our audit and tax practice will remain of high quality, and size isn't as important,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX> is auditor of more Fortune 500 companies than any other firm. Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX> separated its huge consulting practice from the rest of the firm into a unit known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen Consulting.</ENAMEX>
This restructuring followed the defection of a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Andersen</ENAMEX> consulting partners, who felt they were earning the bulk of the revenue for the firm and didn't have enough say in management. Since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersen</ENAMEX> has put a 15% lid on the amount of consulting revenues that would have to be shared with tax and audit partners, a ceiling that some consulting partners still resent.
At the same time, Andersen this month required partners to agree to avoid stealing business or personnel from the firm within 18 months after leaving it.
A party close to the negotiations said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Waterhouse</ENAMEX> found it difficult to negotiate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andersen</ENAMEX> because of the the separate consulting unit. At Price, consulting is fully integrated into the firm.
