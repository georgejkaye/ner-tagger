IT'<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S A HUCKSTER</ENAMEX>'S  dream: Some 320 million European consumers, the world's biggest and richest market, united in a free-trade zone, glued to Euro-TV, dying to rush out and buy lots of Euro-products from big Euro-factories.
The key word, however, is dream. Companies looking for homogenized shoppers when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> tears down trade barriers won't find them in 3 1/2 years. In fact, they probably never will.
It's not for lack of trying. Long before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> launched its 1992 program, ad executives were chattering about global villages and cross-border tastes. The 1992 hoopla, envisioning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as a single business entity, has turned that chatter into a frenzy. Ad spending is soaring, with more than $1 billion in pan-European business awarded to ad agencies since early 1988, according to the magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advertising Age</ENAMEX>.
But when it comes to marketing, the pan-European vision evaporates. A single market, for instance, doesn't mean a single mind-set. Language differences make some product names inappropriate -- or just plain comical. Some companies sell products in five different countries under five different names; how do you advertise that to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> at large? And government regulators seem enamored of their own nitpicking rules that make a  single ad campaign impossible.
``Everyone is struggling with how to do it,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Lannon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX>'s European development director -- ``how to make sure an ad retains the essence of a good European idea but is still sympathetic to local tastes.''
The task isn't entirely hopeless. American icons such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>'s have long treated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as a single market, with upbeat music and smiling faces as their lingua franca. The gurus of globalism also like to talk about the factors pushing some Europeans together. Trendy teenagers everywhere crave the latest in bright Benetton sweaters; fashionable grown-ups covet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rolex</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dior</ENAMEX>. ``The name of the game in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> is building powerful European brands,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lannon</ENAMEX> says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easier</ENAMEX> said than done. For starters, the ``citizen of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'' touted by ad agencies is a myth; even <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> bureaucrats can't homogenize national cultures and tastes. With their nine different languages and distinctive national customs, Europeans will always be far more diverse than Americans -- maybe more so after 1992.
``As the political and economic boundaries fall, a lot of the social and cultural ones will get reinforced,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph De Deo</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam Europe.</ENAMEX> ``Just the way Americans tend to remember their ancestry because they're afraid of becoming too homogenized, there might be a nostalgic strengthening'' of national ties.
For companies trying to sell in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, that means threading through a maze of quirky national tastes. It will be a long time, for instance, before the French stoop to drinking the instant coffee Britons adore. Or consider washing machines. It doesn't matter how they clean; British homemakers want front-loaders while the French insist on top-loaders. Germans like lots of different settings and high spin speeds; Italians favor a slower speed.
Even the soap poured into the machines gets gummed up by national stereotypes. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble Co.</ENAMEX> wanted to pitch its Ariel laundry detergent across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, it ended up with five TV commercials for five markets.
Each shows a housewife in her laundry room telling her teen-age son that Ariel removes stubborn dirt even at low temperatures. But each housewife is subtly different. The blond Italian looks positively glamorous next to her washer; the perky Frenchwoman has curly hair and a turned-up collar. The English mum is a cross between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Poppins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">June Cleaver</ENAMEX>, complete with pearls, pretty dress and soothing voice.
``You couldn't have that kind of interplay with a Euro-housewife and a Euro-son,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Bowden</ENAMEX>, media director for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising International</ENAMEX>, which made the ads. ``If we were selling Vuitton luggage, then an Italian would be just as good as a German or a Brit as long as she was glamorous and obviously rich. But if you've got products targeted to the housewife market, then you have to accept that they are creatures of their own culture. They're not European as such.''
Neither are many product names, and for pan-European campaigns that's the most basic stumbling block of all. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever Group</ENAMEX>, for example, sells a liquid cleanser that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viss</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> Vif, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jif</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Holland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cif</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>. Back in the 1970s, when the cleanser was introduced, a single European name didn't seem necessary, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> used whatever sounded good in various languages. Changing names now would confuse shoppers ``even if you explained it with good European reasons,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> official.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars Inc.</ENAMEX>'s Pedigree pet foods unit had a similar problem with its Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dog</ENAMEX> canned dog food. The product, which originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, was named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cesar</ENAMEX> elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> because ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dog</ENAMEX> does not translate into Monsieur le <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herr Hund</ENAMEX> or whatever it would be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>,'' says a Pedigree official. But earlier this year, Pedigree-contemplating a pan-European campaign-decided it needed a single name. That, in turn, meant running special ads in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> saying Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dog</ENAMEX> is now called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cesar</ENAMEX>.
Even new products can bump against the language barrier. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craton Lodge & Knight</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based product-development firm working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacardi Corp.</ENAMEX>, concocted a fruity bitters with a made-up name -- ``Pavane'' -- suggestive of French chic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacardi</ENAMEX> wanted to sell the drink in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>. Trouble is, ``pavane'' is perilously close to ``pavian.'' And in German that means ``baboon.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLK</ENAMEX> quickly switched to ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pericle</ENAMEX>,'' which doesn't mean anything, it hopes.
Regulatory barriers aren't so easy to sidestep. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> has made some efforts to harmonize general standards, it appears willing to let member countries keep their specific rules. There are a plethora of them, covering broadcast and print ads. Saatchi prints a 52-page book listing the basics; the alcohol section alone runs to seven pages of dense statistics. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX>, for example, forbids TV ads for spirits but allows beer and wine commercials -- as long as they don't run before 7 p.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> allows commercials only for drinks with less than 23% alcohol content, and only after 9:30 p.m.
Candy isn't any safer. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Holland</ENAMEX>, ads for sweets have to show a toothbrush in the corner of the TV screen. (Rule No. 17 of the Dutch broadcast code says the toothbrush must be at least one-tenth the height of the film, rising to at least one-eighth in the final three seconds. And by the way, the ad can't run before 7:55 p.m.) Austria doesn't let children endorse products. Toy commercials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> have to show the product's true size if it costs more than 5,000 pesetas (about $42 at current exchange rates).
So what can companies do in their search for Euro-products? A frequent tactic is exporting a strong national brand to countries where it has never been sold. Determining which products can cross borders successfully is the 1992 game's neatest trick.
``Rational'' products -- ones with logical benefits instead of purely emotional appeal -- are a good bet, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Deo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y&R</ENAMEX> executive. ``One plus one equals two in every country. The more you focus on the product benefits, the more you're avoiding local life-style differences.''
In general, a ``natural'' image appeals to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s growing band of environmentally concerned consumers, especially if the message is simple and visual. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobs Suchard AG</ENAMEX>, the Swiss coffee and chocolate giant, is pitching its Milka milk-chocolate candy bars across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> with TV commercials showing a cow -- painted purple like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milka</ENAMEX>'s wrapper -- mooing in a mountain meadow. No language barrier, just an image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpine</ENAMEX> freshness. ``This is very well appreciated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>-wide,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerhard Zinser</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suchard</ENAMEX>'s marketing manager.
In fact, food -- a literal measure of what Europeans will swallow -- is the focus of marketers' hottest debates. On one side, there is evidence of broadening palates. Who would have thought a decade ago that pasta would be the stuff of power lunches across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>? Even more surprising is Mexican food's takeoff in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IC Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>'s Old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Paso</ENAMEX> unit, the Mexican food leader in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, began selling under its familiar red and yellow label in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in 1984. By 1990, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old El Paso</ENAMEX> estimates the total Mexican food market will be worth 16 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, though the biggest per-capita consumption is in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>, of all places.
``If it is a new food like Mexican, one can go at the whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> with one voice,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mayfield</ENAMEX>, sales and marketing director for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IC</ENAMEX> unit that sells Old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Paso</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. ``We start with virgin territory.''
But in many areas, taste remains chauvinistic. Junk food, for example, isn't universally craved. In a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccann-Erickson</ENAMEX> study of European youth, only 17% of French respondents said they ``really like'' junk food, well below the survey average of 49%. (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s snack champs are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greeks</ENAMEX>; 61% of youths there adore the stuff.)
Convenience food is popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Europe</ENAMEX>, much less so in the south. Confirming their reputation for not caring what's on their dinner plates, Britons have fallen in love with frozen food's best friend, the microwave oven. A recent survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mintel Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> market researchers, found that 43% of British respondents own a microwave, compared with just 3% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italians</ENAMEX>.
As for Euro-consumers, ad agencies claim to see two nascent groups: businessmen and teen-agers. For years, advertisers have thought that businessmen from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> have more in common with businessmen from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> than with fellow Germans.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowden</ENAMEX> figures that only 5% of European businessmen have joined the business jet set. ``It's too easy to think of the European business community as one massively homogeneous market,'' he says. ``It's clearly not.''
Among young people, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccann-Erickson</ENAMEX> survey found some striking similarities. European youths tend to yearn for personal success and worry about being short of money; many define themselves in terms of gadgets they buy.
Some ad executives argue that the growing similarities among teen-agers foreshadow the movement toward a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Euroconsumer</ENAMEX>. ``The next generation will be a major catalyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europeanization</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowden</ENAMEX> says, ``because they'll feel more European and maybe slightly less Swiss or Swedish.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s media magnates are doing their best to help. By 2000, satellite and cable television will reach 64.7% of European households, according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> report. It predicts that cable and satellite ad spending will hit $198 million this year, quadruple by 1992 and soar to $4.5 billion by the end of the century.
Perhaps, but there are plenty of skeptics. Teen-agers may share a few crazes, they say, but tradition dies hard.
``Twenty-five years ago, when TV was introduced, you had some bright spark saying it would create the global consumer,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Harris</ENAMEX>, a lecturer in marketing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Business School</ENAMEX>. ``Five years ago when satellite was introduced, you had the same thing. Basically, nobody's ever found this global consumer.''
