Investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Simmons</ENAMEX> said he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> are willing to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf Corp.</ENAMEX> some time to pursue alternatives to their proposed $55-a-share buy-out -- but only a short time.
``We'll give them a few days to work something out,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> said in an interview last week. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> shows progress toward a transaction that would offer shareholders $55 a share, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> said, ``We'll be pleased. If they don't, we'll pursue our $55-a-share deal'' or pursue a consent solicitation to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX>'s board.
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX>'s stock tumbled $5.125 Friday to close at $52.125 on volume of 1.4 million shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading. The decline came after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filing by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> chemicals concern, indicated they were backing down from their aggressive stance.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX> is delaying its consent solicitation for now because, ``that's our last alternative. Our first alternative is to let them do a restructuring.'' And if the transaction is above $55 a share, he said, ``I would sell.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simmons group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing disclosed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX> already sold 230,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> shares between Sept. 8 and Sept. 12 at prices between $58.50 and $59.50, reducing the group's stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> chemicals concern to 8.9% from 9.9%. In the filing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> said it sold because the shares were trading at a price higher than it thought could be realized through a sale or recapitalization of the company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX>'s stock had been trading above $55 a share since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX> offered to help the company recapitalize or go private in some transaction that would pay shareholders $55 a share, or about $1.4 billion.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Landis Martin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX> president and chief executive officer, told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> last week that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simmons group</ENAMEX> is as willing to support a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> transaction as it is to complete its own transaction.
After the meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> said it and its advisers will pursue other alternatives to a transaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simmons group</ENAMEX>. ``They basically said,'We'We don't want to do a deal with you,''' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> said.
In an interview yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX> will tell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX>'s advisers that it still is interested in participating in one of the other alternatives. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX> probably also will ask for a close look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX>'s books to see if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NL</ENAMEX> could propose a transaction valued at more than $55 a share.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Gulf</ENAMEX> said it hadn't any comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing.
