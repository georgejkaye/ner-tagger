Law firms that have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines.
The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> has reverberated through some of the nation's largest law firms.
While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary, many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work, which has been so lucrative in the past. Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour. If deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do, ``you can't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish,'' says one lawyer at a large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm.
``We're planning on a rip-roaring year in 1989, but next year we'll be another story,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Freedman</ENAMEX>, a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpson Thacher & Bartlett</ENAMEX>. ``We're settling down to a less active period.''
Lawyers at such firms as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sullivan & Cromwell</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willkie Farr & Gallagher</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wachtell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosen & Katz</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fried</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson</ENAMEX> all say they, too, have experienced a significant slowdown, particularly during the past few weeks. ``Everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at sensible prices and if money is available,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nusbaum</ENAMEX>, co-chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willkie Farr.</ENAMEX> ``It's hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical.''
Some lawyers say the slump, while more obvious in recent weeks, began earlier this year. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Block</ENAMEX>, a partner at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gotshal & Manges</ENAMEX>, said that in the first eight months of this year, 89 hostile offers were launched, compared with 157 for the first eight months of
What's more, he said, ``transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing'' and more stringent scrutiny by state courts. Lawyers also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed.
Still, some lawyers say the mergers slowdown hasn't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones. ``We just took another floor for our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> offices,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Flom</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skadden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arps</ENAMEX>, Slate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meagher & Flom</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis Polk & Wardwell</ENAMEX> also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy. ``European companies are looking to buy American ones,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry King</ENAMEX>, the managing partner at that firm. ``But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions.''
MURDER THREAT charged in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> stock-manipulation trial.
In the trial of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas Securities</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Laff</ENAMEX>, the defense accused one of the government's chief witnesses of threatening to kill Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX>'s attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lang</ENAMEX>, filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Lorin</ENAMEX>, told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> should be killed. The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> said was an effort to get Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> to implicate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX>. In his opening arguments last week in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> told the jury that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> was the ``real master criminal'' behind the stock manipulation, and that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> knew nothing about it.
In March, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, and obstructing an investigation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>. The government has charged that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> were part of a conspiracy to maintain the prices of certain stocks at artificially high prices. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX>, a stock promoter, pleaded guilty to the stock-manipulation charges in April and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX>.
During his cross examination of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> read from the transcripts of a conversation that was taped Oct. 20, 1988. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Aslanian</ENAMEX>, the Haas broker who agreed to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation, also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed to cooperate.
According to the transcript, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> should be killed after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aslanian</ENAMEX> told him that information given to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> by another conspirator could jeopardize the stock scheme. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> then repeated the threat, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aslanian</ENAMEX> urged him not to say such things.
From the parts of the transcript read by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX>, it was unclear what exactly Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> feared might happen. When asked for a copy of the transcript, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> said Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas P. Griesa</ENAMEX> had instructed him not to release it or the memorandum.
During the trial, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> whether he had been so upset ``that you considered killing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX>?... Isn't it true that you were so worked up that framing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> for this crime was the least that you planned for him?'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> responded, ``No.'' When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorin</ENAMEX> whether he had taken steps to have Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laff</ENAMEX> killed, the witness again said no.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lieb</ENAMEX>, the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney prosecuting the case, declined to comment on the trial.
TRUSTEE WHO MONITORED settlement payments to Dalkon Shield claimants quits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen A. Saltzburg</ENAMEX>, one of five trustees appointed to monitor payments to women injured by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine contraceptive, resigned, citing personal reasons.

Merhige Jr.</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merhige</ENAMEX> is overseeing the bankruptcy-law reorganization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.H. Robins Co.</ENAMEX>, the company that manufactured the shield. In a letter Monday to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saltzburg</ENAMEX>, the judge said he would ``reluctantly'' accept the resignation.
The $2.38 billion Dalkon Shield <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claimants Trust</ENAMEX> was established as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.H. Robins</ENAMEX>' bankruptcy-reorganization plan to resolve injury claims arising from use of the shield. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products Corp.</ENAMEX> proposes to acquire the company.
The remaining four trustees on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claimants Trust</ENAMEX> have 60 days to nominate a successor to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saltzburg</ENAMEX>. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merhige</ENAMEX> will make the appointment.
