The dreaded ``t word'' suddenly is looming over pension funds, and pension managers are dismayed at the prospect.
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> said Tuesday that he was considering proposing a tax on short-term trades of securities by currently tax-exempt pension funds. Such a measure would be aimed at encouraging a longer-term view toward investing.
Pension managers said yesterday that the idea is misguided. ``They're trying to cure a problem that doesn't exist with the worst possible fix,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Feldman</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX>'s $38 billion retirement fund, said of congressional advocates of a pension tax.
Once taxing pension assets begins, ``it's the camel's nose under the tent, and who knows where it goes from there?'' he said. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Hansen</ENAMEX>, executive director of the $56 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Public Employees Retirement System</ENAMEX>, said: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is hungry for more revenue, and we {pension funds} are a potentially very large target.''
Pension funds, with assets approaching $2 trillion, hold nothing more precious than their tax-exempt status.
Details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Democrat</ENAMEX>'s idea are sketchy, as are those of an earlier proposal along the same lines by Republican Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Kassebaum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> that has received support from Republican Minority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX>. But even the suggestion of a pension-fund tax is touching off alarm bells among retirement-system officials.
Concern that the corporate takeover boom is threatening the ability of U.S. companies to invest in the future and provide secure jobs for workers has become a frequently voiced theme of the Bush administration and many members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. One result of forcing pension plans to take a ``long-term``approach, advocates say, would be to keep them from investing in takeover fights, especially those where companies become targets of hostile bids. ``I think you can make a good case that best investment thinking is done when a long-term horizon is taken,'' said pension-industry analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Ellis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenwich Associates</ENAMEX>. ``It would be great if pension funds took a longer-term view.''
But fund officials contend they are already long-term investors and contribute very little to fueling corporate takeovers. According to pension-industry estimates, no more than 1% or 2% of pension assets are used to finance takeovers, typically by investing in leveraged buy-out funds or by buying takeover-related high-yield junk bonds.
Rather than rapidly buying and selling stock holdings, the $20 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> public employees retirement system, for one, says it typically holds a stock for five or six years; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> public employees system says it turns over its stock portfolio every 10 years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Herod</ENAMEX>, deputy executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Employees Retirement System</ENAMEX>, said that the $6 billion pension fund ``opposes any federal control over our plan,'' and that federal taxation of a state trust would raise constitutional questions. In addition, he said, ``To the extent that any pension money goes to pay tax, it's not available to pay benefits.''
Threatened one public-fund official, ``If they're going to talk about taxing our pension funds, we're going to talk about taxing their Treasury bills.'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities currently are exempt from state taxes.)
The pension-tax idea, which Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> hasn't decided yet to pursue as legislation, was a leading topic of discussion yesterday as a corporate-pension group, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on Investment of Employee Benefit Assets</ENAMEX>, held its annual meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT*/NNP&T</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feldman</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, whose members have more than $500 billion in benefit assets, were ``unanimous in thinking that taxing pension plans is a bad idea.''
``If the tax is directed at fixing a problem of short-term investing, it's simply not a problem in our view,'' he said. ``If it's directed at raising revenue, it's going to make the job of providing adequate pensions that much harder.
