<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Capital Mortgage Insurance Cos.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> jointly announced a mortgage insurance program designed to help low-income and moderate-income people buy homes.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Home Buyer</ENAMEX>'s Program relaxes lending standards to help lower-income families qualify for a mortgage. To help avoid defaults, however, the program requires buyers to attend a training course on choosing, financing and owning a home, and it emphasizes prepurchase inspections.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> unit, said it will insure as much as $500 million in loans, or enough money to finance nearly 10,000 dwellings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> is known, agreed to buy as much as $200 million of the loans from lenders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX>, didn't specify a total.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> are federally chartered, stockholder-owned corporations that operate a secondary market in mortgage loans, buying loans from lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to investors or holding them in portfolio.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX> said six lenders have signed up already and the company expects 50 lenders to participate in the next few months. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory T. Barmore</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX>, said the buyers' program ``addresses a critical need while offering a good business opportunity'' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>, lenders, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX>.
Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> launched a similar initiative, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> Capital insuring home loans to low-income and moderate-income families in five <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> cities. Under that program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> agreed to buy $40 million in mortgages.
The program announced yesterday allows buyers to apply 33% of their income to their monthly housing expenses, rather than the standard 28% required for most financing with a 5% down payment. The program also waives the condition that buyers have a cash reserve equal to two monthly mortgage payments, and it permits buyers to use a subsidized second mortgage to cut costs. As evidence of good credit history, borrowers can also use non-traditional documents such as rent and utility payments.
In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Home Buyer</ENAMEX>'s Program requires potential buyers to attend classes that explain the mortgage application process as well as the income level, savings and credit history needed to obtain a mortgage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instructors</ENAMEX> also teach buyers how to choose a home that isn't going to need extensive repairs, and emphasize home inspections to avert a potential default because of a costly maintenance problem in the first few years. In some cases, the inspections are subsidized.
