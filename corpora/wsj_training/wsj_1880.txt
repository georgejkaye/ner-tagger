<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitec Financial Group</ENAMEX> said it will ask as many as 100,000 investors in 12 of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership.
Under the proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitec</ENAMEX>, a financially troubled real-estate syndicator, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallwood Group Inc.</ENAMEX> would replace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitec</ENAMEX> as the newly formed master limited partnership's general partner and manager. Shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallwood</ENAMEX> is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership, management and financial restructuring of shopping centers, office buildings, apartments and other real estate.
In a statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitec</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard L. Saalfeld</ENAMEX> said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the 12 limited partnerships included in the proposed rollup. While he didn't describe the partnerships' financial condition, he said their operations ``continue to drain the resources of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitec</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitec</ENAMEX> posted a $3.3 million net loss in the second quarter on $11.8 million of revenue, compared with a net loss of $12.9 million in the year-earlier period on revenue of $9.1 million.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equitec</ENAMEX> closed at $2.625 a share, unchanged.
Because of Tuesday's earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern California</ENAMEX>, company officials couldn't immediately be reached for additional comment.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallwood</ENAMEX> said the 12 limited partnerships, which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between 1979 and 1984, raised several hundred million dollars from investors.
