The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> issued $4 billion in bonds in the federal utility's first public debt offering in 15 years.
Proceeds from the bonds, with coupon rates in the 8% range, will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1%. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX> said the refinancing should save $75 million a year in interest payments.
The refinancing is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX>'s strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem: its staggering $18.5 billion debt, most of which is owed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Financing Bank</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX> currently plans to issue a total of $6.7 billion in bonds to refinance its high-interest debt.
The $4 billion bond issue also will help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX> meet its goal of not raising rates for another year, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William F. Malec</ENAMEX>, the agency's chief financial officer.
The bond issue is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX>'s first public offering since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financing Bank</ENAMEX> was created in 1974, primarily to finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX>. But the offering almost didn't happen. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX>, in fact, decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financing Bank</ENAMEX>, which allows TVA to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> contended that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX> couldn't borrow from both it and the public debt market.
The $4 billion in bonds break down as follows: $1 billion in five-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25% and a yield to maturity of 8.33%; $1 billion in 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375% and a yield to maturity of 8.42%; $2 billion in 30-year bonds with five-year call protection, a coupon rate of 8.75% and a yield to maturity of 9.06%. Managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> and co-managed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX>
