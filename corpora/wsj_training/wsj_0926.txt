<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohbayashi Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.W. Howell Co.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selmer-Sande</ENAMEX> AS, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX>, for about $7 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howell</ENAMEX>, a Port <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, construction concern, was established in 1891. It has three <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> branches.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohbayashi</ENAMEX> officials said the purchase was undertaken to participate in ventures in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>. They said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howell</ENAMEX> is particularly successful there because of its membership cooperation with local unions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohbayashi</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s second largest construction company. Until now, its inability to form membership ties with organized labor has kept it from penetrating the lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> metropolitan area construction market.
The company also hopes the latest acquisition will help secure large construction orders from Japanese concerns with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohbayashi</ENAMEX> cited industry publications crediting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howell</ENAMEX>, currently capitalized at $2.2 million, with receiving orders valued at $225 million in 1988.
