<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Publishing Corp.</ENAMEX>, in several ambitious moves to expand its franchise in magazine publishing, said it will acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> magazine and launch two new magazines -- one for college students and the other for small business owners.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Publishing</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX>, said it agreed to purchase the slick consumer monthly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Metrocorp</ENAMEX> for an undisclosed amount. Industry sources estimated the sale price at less than $10 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas O. Ryder</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Publishing</ENAMEX>, said the company will continue to look to acquire magazines in major metropolitan areas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> ``The vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> cardholders are in the top 20 markets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,'' he said. ``We want to build stronger relationships with card members. This is not an isolated event. Our aspirations are to do more than this.''
In five years as head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Publishing</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryder</ENAMEX>, 45, has expanded the company's stake swiftly in consumer magazines, using the credit card mailing lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> to build circulation. While the company has published Travel & Leisure, the country's largest travel magazine, since 1971, under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryder</ENAMEX> it has purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food & Wine magazine</ENAMEX> and the city/regional magazines <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Woman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">L.A.</ENAMEX> Style. It also publishes Departures, a travel magazine, for the company's platinum card holders.
In a related development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Publishing</ENAMEX> said it will launch two custom magazines in early 1990. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connections</ENAMEX>, an existing magazine for 700,000 college students who hold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> cards, will be revamped and expanded. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> also plans to launch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">& Company</ENAMEX>, a magazine for owners and partners in small businesses of less than 100 employees, with a circulation of 1.2 million. Each magazine will be mailed free to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> cardholders. With the two magazines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> now joins a growing group of major consumer magazine publishers who have expanded into the area of custom publications: largely controlled-circulation magazines created for advertisers or published with only one advertiser in its pages.
Although on a smaller scale, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> will be part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Publishing</ENAMEX>'s group ad package. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta magazine</ENAMEX> has been owned for the last two years by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metrocorp</ENAMEX>, which also publishes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, inc. magazines. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metrocorp</ENAMEX> executives couldn't be reached to comment on why they're selling the magazines, but according to sources close to the magazine, it has operated profitably. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryder</ENAMEX> said its annual ad pages have grown from about 700 in 1987 to an estimated 800 ad pages this year.
