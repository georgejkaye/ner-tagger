President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> have agreed in principle to meet for their first summit, and a time should be set in the next few days.
The wheels were set in motion yesterday when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> met Soviet Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> said afterward, ``We have concluded that a summit is necessary, there is no doubt about that.'' And Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> said that he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> plan to set a ``general time framework'' for a meeting when he holds a series of lengthy discussions with the Soviet foreign minister in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> this weekend.
In his hour-and-a-half of discussions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> also told the president that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> isn't seeking direct American economic assistance to help it work out its enormous economic problems. Rather, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said afterward, the Soviet foreign minister said his government would like the U.S. to provide ``technical advice'' on how to reform its economic system.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> officials already had been planning a series of talks with their Soviet counterparts this weekend in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> on how to overhaul and revitalize the Soviet economy. In addition, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said this week that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> will discuss Soviet progress on human-rights issues such as emigration that might lead to a liberalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-Soviet trade restrictions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> meeting came at a time when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his administration are being chided by political opponents who charge that they have been too slow and timid in responding to changes in the Soviet bloc. In addition, the meeting comes at a time when, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is facing unprecedented economic problems and unrest in outlying Soviet republics.
Thus, both sides can benefit from setting a summit date now. For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, such a step would buttress his claim that he is making steady but orderly progress in Soviet relations. For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>, it will help show critics at home that his policies of reform and openness are winning some international rewards.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>, who sent Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> to the U.S. with a long letter on arms control, also won a new statement of American support as a result of yesterday's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> meetings. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said, as the Bush administration has in the past, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s program of perestroika, or internal reform, to succeed. But he also went beyond that to say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> personally to survive as general secretary of the Communist party to continue overseeing the reforms.
``It is the position of the president, the position of the administration, that we want perestroika to succeed, and we'd like to see the general secretary to succeed as well,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said after the meeting. ``Because we think, frankly, that his success is very important in whether or not perestroika succeeds.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> officials sometimes have attempted to distinguish between supporting reforms and counting on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> to remain in charge. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s comment represented a more pointed, public personal endorsement than the administration has generally expressed.
In his comments to reporters, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> seemed to imply that the Bush-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> summit is likely to take place early next year, though he insisted that such a time frame hasn't been set.
``I think it's important that the leaders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> get together periodically,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said. ``It will have been some time, if we're looking at something into next year -- and I'm not saying that that's the time frame we're going to give you in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX>.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> also stressed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> meeting failed to produce much progress in resolving one particularly nagging sticking point between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> reiterated its complaints that Soviet arms continue to flow to Nicaragua at high levels.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> implied that Soviet officials repeated past claims that they have stopped shipping arms directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>. But U.S. officials complain that, while direct Soviet arms shipments may have been stopped, record amounts of Soviet-made weaponry continue to flow to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>.
Asked how the Soviets respond to that American complaint, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> replied: ``They demur a bit on that, and they take the position that they can't totally control what happens with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>.... We have some difficulty with that.
