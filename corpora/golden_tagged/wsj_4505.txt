<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> reached a definitive agreement to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, marking the largest and most significant entry of a Japanese firm into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> entertainment industry.
Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> will begin a tender offer valued at $3.4 billion, or $27 a share, ending two days of speculation about the details of the latest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> mega-deal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> moved to secure the transaction by signing an option agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca Cola Co.</ENAMEX> to purchase its 49% interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, which is due for ratification at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> board meeting Monday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also entered into an option agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allen & Co.</ENAMEX>, which owns a 3% interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> stock climbed 25 cents to close at $26.50 a share yesterday, on volume of about 4.9 million shares, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading. Some Wall Street observers noted that until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> ratifies the option agreement, another bidder could emerge at a higher price. ``For the next three business days it could be open season for another bidder,'' said one large Columbia shareholder. But insiders at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> dismissed such speculation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> said the tender offer will begin next Tuesday, and will be scheduled to expire in 20 business days.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> shares rose 50 cents to close at $64.625 a share in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading. Selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>'s 53.8 million-share stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> proceeds with an indicated value of $1.45 billion.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s vice chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Schulof</ENAMEX>, acknowledged reports that the company is in discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX>, co-chief executive officers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX>, regarding an arrangement whereby Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> would succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Kaufman</ENAMEX> as chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> would also join the company in a senior position.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is also apparently discussing a purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>, which until recently was called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris Industries.</ENAMEX> The two executives own a 28% stake in the company, valued at about $39 million, based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>'s latest price of $12.75 a share in national over-the-counter trading. The issue didn't trade yesterday.
A big stumbling block, however, is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peter</ENAMEX>'s arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> unit, for which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> has produced such hits as ``Batman,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s highest-grossing movie ever. Just last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> signed a new five-year exclusive movie production and distribution agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, and the company has a number of films in production and development for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, including ``Bonfire of the Vanities.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> officials declined comment yesterday, and neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gubers</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> returned calls seeking comment. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> apparently took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> officials by surprise, even though the two producers are close friends with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX> and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Semel</ENAMEX>.
Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> decides to release the two from their exclusive arrangement, it is likely to prove extremely difficult for the producers to extricate themselves from their commitments at the studio, where many of their projects are already under way.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulof</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> said yesterday that ``it wouldn't be appropriate'' for him to discuss the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>, saying the two sides would have to work the situation out.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s move into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> provides the company with a crucial third leg for its global strategy of becoming an integrated entertainment software and hardware company. Its purchase two years ago of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records Inc.</ENAMEX> for $2 billion made it the world's largest record producer; it is already the leading manufacturer of audio hardware equipment, such as compact disk players and stereos.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> has been eager to buy a movie company, to get its hands on a steady supply of filmed entertainment product to marry with its vast array of video hardware such as video recorders and TV sets. With the control of a large motion picture library, it hopes to help boost sales of such new video technology as laser disks and 8mm video.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> has had a poor record at the box office in recent years and a revolving door in its motion picture executive suite, the studio has a huge library of films and one of the most profitable television production and syndication businesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> had joined on-again, off-again negotiations over price for more than a year with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, but it wasn't until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> decided to come up a few dollars per share in price and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> decided to lower its expectations somewhat that the two sides were able to reach agreement.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulof</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and his advisers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> began talking actively to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and its representatives at investment bankers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allen & Co.</ENAMEX> over the last several months and negotiated the definitive agreement last weekend. Yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulof</ENAMEX> said, ``We felt it was an excellent quality library and a company with great potential.''
He added, ``While we are fully aware of problems with the current slate of movie production, the basic qualities in the company are very solid and we don't think there's anything that's fundamentally a problem.'' As for the movie side of the business, ``problems in movie production take only a few hits to turn around,'' he said.
As part of the announcement yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaufman</ENAMEX>, and the company's chief operating officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis J. Korman</ENAMEX>, said they would leave the company to pursue other interests, probably in the entertainment industry. ``We're going to remain in the entertainment business,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaufman</ENAMEX> said in an interview. He added that leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> ``was not an easy decision to reach, but both of us felt it was the right time to do different things.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaufman</ENAMEX> stands to make about $30 million in the sale.
Speculation yesterday centered on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dawn Steel</ENAMEX>, hired less than two years ago as the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> movie studio, would stay on if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> becomes head of the parent company. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steel</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> worked together on the movie ``Flashdance'' and are said to have good relations. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steel</ENAMEX> declined comment. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulof</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, said that while he hasn't spoken to any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> executives, ``I would hope that she would want to stay on, just like all management.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulof</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s track record with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> was ``that management stayed, satisfied we were a good corporate parent.'' Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX> has been struggling to regain lost market share, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> has stayed out of the company's day-to-day affairs.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulof</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> planned to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> as an independent subsidiary with its own board; the studio will ``interface'' with him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> but not report directly to him. ``We give a major subsidiary independent authority,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulof</ENAMEX> said. ``Our involvement tends to be encouragement.
