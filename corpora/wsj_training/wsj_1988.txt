<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, which is preparing to speed up tariff cuts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, recorded a 47% narrowing in its trade surplus with the U.S. in August, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistics Canada</ENAMEX>, a federal agency, reported.
U.S. exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> jumped 11.2% in August from July while U.S. imports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> rose only 2.7%. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s trade surplus with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> narrowed to C$656.5 million (US$558 million) in August from C$1.23 billion (US$1.04 billion) in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
U.S. exports benefited in August from heavy Canadian spending on new plant and equipment and a pickup in Canadian auto demand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX> officials said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, which do more trade than any other pair of nations, are to meet next month to arrange an acceleration of planned tariff cuts under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> free trade agreement.
Industries in both countries have requested a speedup of tariff cuts on hundreds of products. Some tariffs were eliminated when the trade pact took effect Jan. 1. The remainder were to be phased out in five or 10 annual installments, with all tariffs eliminated by January 1998.
The two countries aim to reach an agreement by early December on a package of accelerated tariff cuts that would take effect early next year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX> officials said the trade pact has kindled an export interest among many small Canadian companies that previously had little or no foreign sales.
For such businessmen, the Canadian government is organizing 55 missions this year to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> states bordering on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. The businessmen are introduced to potential agents and distributors and instructed in trade procedures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Commerce Department</ENAMEX> is planning to try out similar trips on U.S. businessmen in coming months under its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada First Outreach</ENAMEX> Program. Participants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> missions to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> are to be assisted by members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service Corps of Retired</ENAMEX> Executives, a volunteer group, in dealing with their export challenges.
The Canadian government also has recently opened new trade offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Juan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>, bringing the total number of such Canadian offices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> to 27. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has six trade promotion offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s export effort has been blunted by robust home market demand and by an 18% appreciation of the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart in the past three years that has made Canadian goods more costly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s trade surplus with all countries narrowed to C$203.5 million in August from C$528.3 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistics Canada</ENAMEX> said.
