<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> plans a news conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> today to announce the acquisition of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>-based data networking company, people close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> say.
Individuals close to the company said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> will announce the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an information technology and services company, for between $250 million and $300 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Morris</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> analyst based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> operates a data network similar to that run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tymnet</ENAMEX> in the U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecommunications PLC</ENAMEX> agreed last month to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tymnet</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> for $355 million.
Tymnet provides U.S. corporations with a computer-controlled network that shuttles electronic messages. The messages vary widely and include electronic mail and credit card verification, among other things.
Spokesmen for the telephone giant wouldn't confirm the expected announcement. Asked how much money was involved, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> spokesman said, ``I've seen bigger deals.''
A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broadview Associates</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> investment bank that specializes in software and information technology acquisitions, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broadview</ENAMEX> helped orchestrate the acquisition to be announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT*/NNP&T</ENAMEX> today. Neither she, nor officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broadview</ENAMEX>, would comment further.
Besides data-communications services, analysts said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Istel</ENAMEX> puts together computer systems for companies, much as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Data Systems</ENAMEX> does in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> An Istel acquisition ``would give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT*</ENAMEX>  more expertise in back-office networking and opens a door in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Grubman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc.</ENAMEX>
Analysts said they think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> operates a packet network, which is currently the most efficient way to transmit certain types of data like electronic mail. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> does sell some packet services in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, but not to a great extent, analysts said.
Such an acquisition would also be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s first international expansion into so-called value-added networking. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telecommunications</ENAMEX> executives believe a huge market will eventually exist for computerized information services that are delivered to businesses and homes over phone lines.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tymnet</ENAMEX> acquisition was viewed as a big push to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for information services. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> only last month got court permission to expand in the market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istel</ENAMEX> would also fit neatly into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>'s vision of becoming a global leader in what it calls the information movement and management industry. To do this, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> executives believe they must sell a rich variety of voice and data services, as well as equipment, that allow companies to build global networks to help them manage their business more efficiently. Three years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> tried to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDS</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>, but that deal fell through.
