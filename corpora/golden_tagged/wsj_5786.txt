The last of three settlements in one of the nation's largest tax-shelter scams is expected to be approved by a federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> early next week.
The total of the settlements -- $16.9 million -- will be the biggest civil settlement of a tax-shelter case, tax lawyers said. At least 5,000 investors will recoup a portion of more than $45 million in losses from three fraudulent shelters sold in 1982 and 1983.
The wide-ranging scam, which involved promoters, lawyers, engineers, and accountants in a dozen states, was based on investments in the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Control System</ENAMEX>,'' an electronic switch which could monitor and conserve electricity for businesses.
In several civil suits, consolidated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern District of New York</ENAMEX>, investors claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEC Leasing Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Energy Leasing Corp.</ENAMEX> both of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, the two principal promoters, and 34 other defendants violated federal securities and racketeering laws in a series of sham sales of the device. The promoters marketed the investment as a tax-shelter security.
The investors alleged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Energy</ENAMEX> inflated the value of several models of the electronic switch by asserting they were worth between $65,000 and $280,000. Plaintiffs' lawyers put the value in the range of $500 to $3,000. The promoters allegedly exaggerated the available investment tax credits and depreciation deductions.
In addition to tax benefits, the investors alleged they were led to believe they would reap huge profits through a revenue-sharing arrangement with the users of the switch.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Labaton</ENAMEX>, a lawyer for the investors, said that although many of the devices were manufactured, very few, if any, were installed.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labaton</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodkind</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wechsler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labaton & Rudoff</ENAMEX>, said one reason the promoters were successful was that ``energy had sex appeal'' in the early 1980s.
``The opinions of experts were the real key to the sales,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labaton</ENAMEX>. The experts, including lawyers, engineers, and accountants, ``simply did a reckless job. They didn't look far enough,'' he said.
One of the experts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touche, Ross & Co.</ENAMEX> settled for $2 million, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labaton</ENAMEX>. The accounting firm has since merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins & Sells</ENAMEX>. Another accounting firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stuart Becker & Co.</ENAMEX>, settled for $2.3 million; the engineering firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Day & Zimmerman</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, for $3.8 million; and two law firms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spierer Woodward & Holguin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernstein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stein & Rush</ENAMEX> settled for $4.9 million and $1.7 million respectively.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> grand jury indicted 12 individuals connected with the scam in April 1988. Seven pleaded guilty. Of the five who went to trial in last November, two were acquitted. The three others, including the former general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvatore Giuffrida</ENAMEX>, were sentenced to prison terms earlier this year.
Five law firms have been working together on the civil cases for nearly five years. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labaton</ENAMEX>'s co-lead counsel is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fay Clayton</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> law firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curley & Clayton.</ENAMEX>
PRESIDENT OF COMPANY that violated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> standards will serve time.
In the 18 years that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Justice</ENAMEX> has been prosecuting employers for risking the lives of their employees, no company official has ever been sentenced to serve time -- until last week.
The 35-year-old president of a plumbing and heating company in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.D.</ENAMEX>, was sentenced to six-months imprisonment because of a construction accident that killed two men. All but 45 days of the sentence was suspended. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Elliot</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elliot Plumbing & Heating</ENAMEX>, earlier pleaded guilty to deliberately failing to comply with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</ENAMEX> standards for digging trenches. His attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Duncan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.D.</ENAMEX>, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot</ENAMEX> will serve the time either in jail or a halfway house.
Two of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot</ENAMEX>'s employees died and a third was injured in May 1988 when the trench they were working in collapsed for the second time in four days.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> have been criticized for being lax in pursuing criminal penalties against reckless employers. Since its inception in 1971, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> has referred 54 workplace accident cases for criminal prosecution.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> has prosecuted 17 and has won civil and criminal sanctions in 13.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DALLAS</ENAMEX> LAWYER will run for governor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Luce III</ENAMEX>, longtime counsel to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billionaire H. Ross Perot</ENAMEX>, will kick off his campaign for governor. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luce</ENAMEX>, a founding partner of the 150-lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes & Luce</ENAMEX>, will join three other candidates for the Republican nomination.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luce</ENAMEX> spent most of the past year lobbying to secure funding for the supercolliding superconductor research facility to be built south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>. Last year, he was embroiled in litigation between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> over the terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s 1986 buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Data Systems Corp.</ENAMEX>, the data-processing firm founded by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perot</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perot</ENAMEX> says he doesn't have a role in his lawyer's gubernatorial campaign. ``When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luce</ENAMEX> becomes governor, I will certainly miss him as an able attorney,'' he says.
TWO FORMER OFFICIALS OF <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIRST MARYLAND SAVINGS & LOAN INC.</ENAMEX> were sentenced to prison Friday in connection with the thrift's failure in 1985. Former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julian M. Seidel</ENAMEX>, 53, was sentenced to 12 years behind bars and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior</ENAMEX> Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James R. Porter</ENAMEX>, 41, was sentenced to seven years. Both were convicted in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> in June of multiple counts of conspiracy and mail - and wire-fraud related to insider loans, false reports to regulators and false statements to the public. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Maryland</ENAMEX> collapsed in August 1985 owing about 2,700 depositors more than $118 million.
GERMAN LAW FIRM ENTERS <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX> MARKET: One of the largest law firms in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mueller Weitzel Weisner</ENAMEX>, plans to open an office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> next year. Two other German firms have <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> offices. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mueller Weitzel</ENAMEX> is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s fastest-growing firms. In January, it will merge with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hengeler Kurth Wirtz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dusseldorf</ENAMEX> in what will be one of the first major law firm mergers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>. The combined firm will have about 50 lawyers. Next month Mueller <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weitzel</ENAMEX>, known for its international corporate work, will open a branch in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYERSON & KUHN RECRUITS REAL-ESTATE</ENAMEX> PARTNER: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert W. Claeson</ENAMEX>, 49, a partner at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shea & Gould</ENAMEX>, will join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myerson & Kuhn</ENAMEX>, also of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claeson</ENAMEX>, who has been at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shea & Gould</ENAMEX> since 1972, will head <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myerson & Kuhn</ENAMEX>'s real-estate practice. A group of 20 real-estate lawyers led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Stadtmauer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Bailkin</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myerson & Kuhn</ENAMEX> earlier this year.
