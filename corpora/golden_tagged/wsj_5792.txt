President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> gave the strongest signal yet that the government would cede majority control of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s 56%-owned telephone monopoly to private investors when a new national telecommunications strategy is unveiled this week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Telefonos de Mexico</ENAMEX> ``ended up in the hands of the state because before it wasn't adequately administered'' as a private-sector company, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> said yesterday in a speech to the phone workers union. ``Nevertheless, the Mexican state doesn't have sufficient resources to achieve its adequate growth.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> never referred specifically to a privatization of the phone company. He did indicate that in the coming telecommunications revamp, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicans</ENAMEX> would retain a majority stake in the monopoly, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telmex</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX> also praised telephone workers union leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco Hernandez Juarez</ENAMEX>, who discussed the prospect of privatizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telmex</ENAMEX> in unusually frank terms. ``Privatizing permits overcoming... some problems of financing and administration in the short and medium term,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hernandez Juarez</ENAMEX> said. He cautioned, however, that a greater private-sector role wouldn't solve all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telmex</ENAMEX>'s problems.
Many foreign phone companies are interested in a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telmex</ENAMEX>.
