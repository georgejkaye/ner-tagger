Showbiz Pizza <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irving</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, said it expects to post a third-quarter loss because of its decision to close up to 26 of 52 ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monterey House</ENAMEX>'' restaurants operated by one of its subsidiaries.
The restaurant company anticipates the closings will result in an extraordinary charge of approximately $4.5 million before taxes, but also estimates gains of approximately $1 million from sale of the closed properties.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard M. Frank</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the stores will be closed as soon as possible because they have been ``an annual $500,000 cash drag on the company.'' Restaurants targeted for closing are in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tulsa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okla.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monterey House</ENAMEX> restaurants account for about 15% of annual revenue at the company, which also operates 258 Showbiz <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pizza Place</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck E. Cheese</ENAMEX> restaurants.
