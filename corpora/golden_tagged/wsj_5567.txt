<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> said a federal judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> denied an attempt by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX> to block the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas Insurance Department</ENAMEX> from reviewing his unfriendly # 13.4 billion ($20.8 billion) bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>, parent of Farmers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> court is the fifth to reject Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s request for an injunction, after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> filed lawsuits in federal courts in the nine states where Farmers has operations seeking to block the insurance commissions there from reviewing his offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial-services concern. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> has appealed the denials in the other states. The request for an injunction is still pending in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s Takeover Panel last week gave Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> more time to pursue the bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> because of the regulatory delays in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Without the extension past the earlier Oct. 7 deadline, the bid would have been doomed.
In an attempt to appease the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> regulators, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> last month reached an agreement for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi Assurances</ENAMEX> to buy Farmers for $4.5 billion if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> acquires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T.</ENAMEX>
But a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> politicians headed by state Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred E. Alquist</ENAMEX> blasted that proposal in a recent letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s insurance director, Roxani <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillespie</ENAMEX>. The senator said in his letter that the plan would ``immediately burden Farmers with $4.5 billion in debt,'' and he urged the commissioner to give the proposed acquisition ``the most thorough possible review.'' The letter was co-signed by 60 members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> state legislature.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Barberis</ENAMEX>, deputy chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi</ENAMEX>, maintained yesterday that ``There will be absolutely no'junk ' financing used in the acquisition of Farmers... {and} there will be no financial constraints imposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi</ENAMEX> upon Farmers.
