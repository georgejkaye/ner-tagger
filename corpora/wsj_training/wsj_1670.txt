<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel Inc.</ENAMEX> said third-quarter net income rose 73%, to $38 million, or 76 cents a share, from $21.9 million, or 45 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue rose 34% to $410 million from $306.6 million a year earlier.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX>'s world-wide volume has grown 25% in a climate of relatively flat industry sales,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W. Amerman</ENAMEX>, chairman. He said the toy company's ``prospects for a strong fourth quarter'' are also good.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX> attributed the jump in quarter net to strong world-wide sales of its Barbie doll, Hot Wheels cars, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disney</ENAMEX> toys and other well-known toy lines. The company also cited retail trade and consumer demand for new products introduced this year, such as Cherry Merry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muffin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turtle Tots.</ENAMEX>
For the nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX> net more than doubled to $58.9 million, or $1.19 a share, from $25.4 million, or 53 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 25%, to $877.6 million, from $702.4 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX> said the company's sale of rights to land and buildings at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawthorne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, headquarters resulted in a $13 million charge to third-quarter operating profit. The charge didn't affect net for the quarter as it was offset by tax benefits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX> has purchased a new headquarters building in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Segundo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, which it will occupy by the end of next year.
