The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> approved an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> request to trade a futures contract based on 10-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> notes.
The contract, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX>'s first venture into the futures markets in a decade, is designed strictly for big players. Each contract represents a 10-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> note with a face value at maturity of $100,000. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX>, which will trade the contract through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex Commodities Corp.</ENAMEX> unit, expects the contract to be used mostly as a hedging vehicle against the notes themselves.
The contract is an attempt by the exchange to broaden its product line. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX>, which has ceded its once-strong position in stock trading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market, has aggressively marketed its options contracts in recent years.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX> has ``been looking for greater respectability,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perrin Long</ENAMEX>, an industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``Futures tied to more acceptable investment vehicles... over time help change the image to {one of} greater respectability.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX>'s contract will offer the new wrinkle of electronic order-matching, taking the contract out of the hands of brokers in pits who trade them on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX> contends that the electronic system will provide fairer pricing.
The contract will be settled in the most recently auctioned 10-year note. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX> said it expects the contract to be used by primary dealers looking to hedge the risk of their inventory, by institutions that want to hedge against price movements of bonds they own, and by large customers who might want to speculate on the yield of the notes.
