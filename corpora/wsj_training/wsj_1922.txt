The lethal shudders that wracked the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay Area</ENAMEX> -- rated a 6.9 on the Richter scale -- didn't match the great earthquake of 1906, rated at 8.25.
The difference of just 1.35 points on the scale, designed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Richter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caltech</ENAMEX> in the 1930s, means the older quake was ``10 to 20 times stronger,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane Johnson</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California Berkeley Seismographic</ENAMEX> Station.
The ground ruptured along a 20-to-30-mile stretch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Andreas</ENAMEX> Fault on Tuesday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> added. In 1906, the rupture was 300 miles long and a couple feet wide.
Though the epicenter of Tuesday's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX>, and 50 miles south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion. But the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill, as were the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marina District of San Francisco</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> -- two areas of maximum devastation.
``Landfill -- loose and unconsolidated earth -- may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Segar</ENAMEX>, professor of geosciences at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco State University</ENAMEX> in a televised interview. ``It liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern. Our quake behaved much like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico City</ENAMEX> earthquake, where great damage was miles from the epicenter.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX> seismographic station, said: ``Landfill can be done if it's properly compacted. You can drive piles on it and build on it.'' He cited the example of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s financial district, where many new glass towers survived almost unscathed.
But the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult to address, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> predicted.
``The attention span of the public is short,'' he said. ``We've known for years and years we've got lots of old {pre-1950s} unreinforced brick and masonry buildings.''
One old building, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden State Bank</ENAMEX> Building on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Front Street</ENAMEX>, had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake, leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air, while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing rush-hour pedestrians and cars. Reinforcing such old building stock, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said, ``comes down to money. It's a danger. We know it's there. And sooner or later, we have to do something about it.''
The urgency is heightened because this week's earthquake -- while major and followed by hundreds of aftershocks -- didn't release enough pent-up energy tension along the faultlines to preclude more and bigger quakes soon.
``The big one is still due,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> predicted in an interview. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> has three very dangerous faults, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Andreas</ENAMEX>, the Hayward fault and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calaveras</ENAMEX> fault. It {Tuesday's quake} hasn't solved our problem. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, this is the reality.
