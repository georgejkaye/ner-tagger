Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American International Group Inc.</ENAMEX> expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million. Analysts said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIG</ENAMEX> has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages. AIG insured property in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean Islands</ENAMEX> and the coastal regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul Cos.</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Paul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minn</ENAMEX>, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million. That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX> is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Udayan Ghose</ENAMEX>, an insurance industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna</ENAMEX>'s third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis. That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Fire & Casualty Co.</ENAMEX> unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster.
When damages in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million. It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurricane Alicia</ENAMEX>, which hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Galveston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, area in 1983.
