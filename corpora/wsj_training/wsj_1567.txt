WHEN <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JAMES SCHWARTZ</ENAMEX> was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice. ``He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great,'' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>, now 40. He tried management consulting, traded in turquoise for a while, and even managed professional wrestlers. Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill -- financial planning.
It should be noted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>, who operates out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Englewood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle. But in this case the needle has a very sharp point. Though it's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent, the fact remains that, as one wag puts it, ``anybody who can fog a mirror'' can call himself a financial planner.
Planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars, but in effect they operate in the dark. There is no effective regulation of planners, no accepted standard for admission into their ranks -- a dog got into one trade group -- no way to assess their performance, no way even to know how many of them there are (estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000). All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning.
So it should come as no shock that the profession, if that's what it is, has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients' money. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alarmed</ENAMEX>, state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners. Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards, too; they're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine.
But reform hasn't taken hold yet. ``The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Stapf</ENAMEX>, director of investor education for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American Securities Administrators Association</ENAMEX>.
An admittedly limited survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASAA</ENAMEX>, whose members are state securities-law regulators, found that between 1986 and 1988 ``fraud and abuse'' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $400 million. The rogues' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons, a compulsive gambler or two, various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy, and one man who scammed his wife's grandmother. What's more, the losses they and the others caused ``are just what we are stumbling over,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stapf</ENAMEX>, adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected.
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners. Nobody can estimate the toll, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gargan</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, planner and head of one trade group, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Association of Registered Financial Planners</ENAMEX>, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is ``humongous,'' far greater than that from crookery. His group, like others, wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners.
Surveying all this, some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all. For most investors ``the benefits just aren't worth the risks,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Roper</ENAMEX>, who follows financial-planning issues for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Federation of America</ENAMEX>, a consumer-advocacy organization based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
She concedes that such a position is ``unfair'' to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade, but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it. She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials, consult regulators and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Business Bureaus</ENAMEX> -- but found that even some people who took these steps ``were still getting ripped off.''
The bad news, however, hasn't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Reform</ENAMEX> Act of 1986, which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners, and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand, and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business. But membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Association of Financial Planners</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IAFP</ENAMEX>), the industry's biggest trade group, is still nearly triple what it was in 1980, and it's believed that the ranks of planners who don't belong to any group have soared as well.
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners, and the pool of capital they influence is enormous. A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAFP</ENAMEX> in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $154 billion of their clients' money in the previous 12 months.
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult, if not impossible, to regulate. Even the minority of them who must register with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> as ``investment advisers'' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency's capacity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade. Currently, a registered investment adviser can expect an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> audit only once every 12 years. A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years. ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathryn Mcgrath</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s division of investment management.
So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded, self-regulatory organization patterned on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association of Securities Dealers</ENAMEX>, which operates in the brokerage business. Such an organization could, among other things, set minimum standards for competence, ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules.
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX>, the puckish planner from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Englewood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, says that allowing the business to police itself would be ``like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gargan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX> planner who heads one trade group, favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> to hire more staff.
(Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gargan</ENAMEX>'s views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAFP</ENAMEX>, the major industry organization. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAFP</ENAMEX> recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gargan</ENAMEX>'s group was excluded. That may be because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gargan</ENAMEX>, smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group, enrolled his  dog, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beauregard</ENAMEX>, as a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IAFP</ENAMEX>. Then he sent the pooch's picture with the certificate of membership -- it was made out to ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris `Bo</ENAMEX>' Regaard'' -- to every newspaper he could think of.)
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASAA</ENAMEX>, the organization of state securities regulators, is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states. It requires financial planners to register with states, pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest.
The most common conflict involves compensation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASAA</ENAMEX> estimates that nearly 90% of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities, insurance and other financial products they recommend. The issue: Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments, or the ones that garner the biggest commissions?
In 1986 the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> attorney general's office got an order from a state court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albany</ENAMEX> shutting down First <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian Corp.</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albany</ENAMEX> financial-planning firm that had invested $55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors. In its notice of action, the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into ``balanced'' investment portfolios; instead, the attorney general alleged, the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings, coins and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> condos. Those investments paid big commissions to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX>, payments investors were never told about, the attorney general alleged.
Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted. In practice, the attorney general alleged in an affidavit, if an investor had access to cash ``the chances of being turned down by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX> were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX>.''
And, the attorney general added, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX>'s president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger V. Sala</ENAMEX>, portrayed himself as a ``financial expert'' when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma, work as a real-estate and insurance salesman, and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX> and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing, according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Manion</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala</ENAMEX>'s attorney, says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general's contentions about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Meridian</ENAMEX>'s business practices are incorrect. As for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala</ENAMEX>'s qualifications, ``the snooty attorneys for the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> decided Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sala</ENAMEX> wasn't qualified because he didn't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> degree,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manion</ENAMEX>.
Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common. Two such actions, both filed earlier this year in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> state court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, could be particularly embarrassing to the industry: both name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Chandler Peterson</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAFP</ENAMEX>, as defendant.
One suit, filed by more than three dozen investors, charges that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> misused much of the $9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted, spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest. Those companies, in turn, paid Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> commissions and fees, the suit alleges.
The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> as part of an effort to purchase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Scottsdale</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scottsdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz</ENAMEX>. One plaintiff, a doctor, testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> $50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician ``the privilege of making additional investments'' with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX>.
In affidavits, each plaintiff claims Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> took the plaintiffs' and other investors' money to a meeting of the bank's directors.
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots, he opened up his briefcase and dumped $1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myron Diebel</ENAMEX>, the bank's president. ``He said he wanted to show the color of his money,'' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diebel</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> officials, however, showed him the door, and the sale never came off. According to the suit, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> has yet to return the plaintiffs' investment. They want it back. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits, saying he prefers to save such responses for court. But he does say that all of his activities have been ``entirely proper.''
On the suit by the limited partners, he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs. The suit, he adds, ``is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people.''
Rearding the suit over the bank bid, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> says it is filled with ``inflammatory language and half truths.'' He declines to go into specifics.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a ``sign of the times'' in which people generally are more prone to sue. ``I don't know anybody in the industry who hasn't experienced litigation,'' he says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> also says he doesn't consider himself a financial planner anymore. He now calls himself an ``investment banker.''
In many scams or alleged scams involving planners, it's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm's way. Using it, wouldn't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner?
Other cases go to show that an old saw still applies: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Certificates of deposit don't pay 23% a year, for example, but that didn't give pause to clients of one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> planner. Now they're losers and he's in jail in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mobile County</ENAMEX>. Cds yielding 40% are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing ``bank'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marshall Islands</ENAMEX> is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator -- but investors fell for that one too.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as $100? Never mind. You already know the answer.
