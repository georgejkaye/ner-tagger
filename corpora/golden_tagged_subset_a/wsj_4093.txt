<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preussag AG</ENAMEX> announced plans to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter AG</ENAMEX> steelmaking and engineering group from the West German government for a price reportedly exceeding two billion marks ($1.06 billion).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preussag</ENAMEX>, which has widespread metals trading, energy and engineering interests, said the takeover would create a metals and engineering conglomerate with 70,000 employees world-wide.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preussag</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX> are roughly equal in size, with combined annual sales of about 27 billion marks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX>'s losses had been a drain on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX>'s treasury until a restructuring turned it around last year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX> resumed dividend payments to the government in the year ended Saturday, and it began repaying federal subsidies.
A West German <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> spokesman said the management boards of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preussag</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX> have agreed to the transaction. The plan now must be approved by the companies' supervisory boards and the West German Parliament. Federal antitrust authorities aren't expected to raise objections.
``We had been waiting until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX> was healthy and ready for sale, and this has occurred,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> spokesman said. This week's edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Der Spiegel magazine</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preussag</ENAMEX> would pay Bonn more than two billion marks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX>. Corporate and government officials declined to confirm or deny the reported price.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preussag</ENAMEX> transaction has emerged as an alternative to plans by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fried</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krupp G.m.b. H.</ENAMEX>, a steel and engineering concern, to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX>. Those plans fell apart amid political opposition from the state government of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Saxony</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX> is based, which feared job cuts if Krupp became <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salzgitter</ENAMEX>'s owner.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preussag</ENAMEX> didn't disclose its financing arrangements, but it is expected to rely heavily on a big shareholder, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westdeutsche Landesbank</ENAMEX>, which owns 45% of the metals concern.
