<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall Laboratories</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approved for prescription sale a liquid form of its ibuprofen drug for children, and an over-the-counter product combining ibuprofen with a nasal decongestant.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehall</ENAMEX>, a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products Corp.</ENAMEX>, said its new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coadvil</ENAMEX> is the first product to combine ibuprofen, which it markets under the trade name Advil, with another medication. Coadvil contains Advil and pseudoephedrine, a widely used oral drug to relieve nasal congestion.
The prescription drug, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX>'s Advil Suspension, is a fruit-flavored liquid version of ibuprofen, suggested for use to reduce fever and treat signs and symptoms of juvenile arthritis. It also is indicated for use by adults to relieve rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis symptoms and other pain.
Use of aspirin to treat fever in children has declined, because of concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reye</ENAMEX>'s syndrome, which has been associated with influenza or chicken pox in children who have received aspirin.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitehall</ENAMEX>'s Advil is the second-biggest over-the-counter pain-relief product, with a 12% share of the $2.2 billion annual consumer-analgesic business.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitehall</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the company began shipping Coadvil to retailers yesterday and it will be a ``major promotion. As the first ibuprofen combination, it is going to be a very big product.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children</ENAMEX>'s Advil Suspension will be available ``by the time physicians begin prescribing it,'' she said.
