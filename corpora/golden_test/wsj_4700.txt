Parker & Parsley Development Partners Limited Partnership said it adopted a rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each unit outstanding of the partnership. The partnership, which is based in Midland, Texas, has about 5.8 million units outstanding.
The rights will become exercisable if someone acquires 20% or more of the outstanding units, or makes a tender offer for 20% or more. Rights holders will be able to purchase one unit for $37.50.
The rights will be distributed Oct. 6 and will expire Sept. 26, 1999.
A spokesman for the oil and natural gas limited partnership said the rights aren't being distributed in response to any specific effort to acquire the company.
