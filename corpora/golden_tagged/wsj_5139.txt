<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX>, in part of an management overhaul planned earlier this year, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred J. Manzella</ENAMEX> was elected to its board and to a newly created post of executive vice president.
As a director, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manzella</ENAMEX>, 59 years old, succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank W. Lynch</ENAMEX> who retired as an officer of the aerospace concern last year and as a director yesterday.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manzella</ENAMEX>, previously senior vice president for business operations, which included reponsibility for contracts, pricing, environmental management, security, material and services, will add responsibility for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX>'s legal, human resources and public affairs operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Kresa</ENAMEX>, president and chief operating officer and successor-designate as chief executive officer to Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas V. Jones</ENAMEX>, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manzella</ENAMEX>'s post is intended to promote greater efficiency by bringing corporate staff functions closer to important business operations.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kresa</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manzella</ENAMEX>'s election is part of a management realignment plan announced in May at the company's annual meeting. At that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> said it might cut as many as 3,000 employees from its 44,000-member work force.
Analysts speculated that much of the realignment plans were simply putting the best possible face on an industry cycle that has seen development peak in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> products.
