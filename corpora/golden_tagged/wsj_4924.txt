<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen AG</ENAMEX>'s profit in fiscal 1989 will show faster growth than sales because the company expanded in high-profitability market niches, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dieter Spethmann</ENAMEX> said.
The steel and engineering company expects to report a 14% rise in sales for the year that will end Saturday to around 33 billion marks ($16.98 billion) from 29.22 billion marks in fiscal 1988, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spethmann</ENAMEX> said in an interview.
``The concentration on our own niches, which we can exploit, has helped us measurably in 1989 and has strengthened our profit disproportionally,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> plans to look for acquisitions as well, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal</ENAMEX>, but will continue to shy away from hostile takeover bids, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spethmann</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> also is likely to search for suitable takeover targets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, he said.
The chairman said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> will raise its fiscal 1989 dividend from the 7.50 marks a share paid for fiscal 1988, but he wouldn't be specific about the increase.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spethmann</ENAMEX> also declined to be specific about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX>'s fiscal 1989 profit. But his comments appeared to confirm analysts' belief that the earnings trend of the company's first six months continued in the second half. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX>'s first-half net income rose 29% to 372 million marks from 289 million marks. Analysts have said they expect its fiscal 1989 net to approach one billion marks, compared with 680 million marks in fiscal 1988.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> will start fiscal 1990 with a ``friendly undertone in all of our four divisions,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spethmann</ENAMEX> said. He cited a sharp rise in orders in the capital goods and engineering unit to a record level and stable order backlog in the steel, specialty steel and trading sectors.
``When it comes to profit, I am insatiable,'' he added, though he declined to make any forecasts for fiscal 1990 profit and sales.
Some analysts nonetheless are cautious about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX>'s outlook, predicting a profit drop. ``I assume that this year's boom will come slowly to an end,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Schramm</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinkaus & Burkhardt</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Duesseldorf</ENAMEX>.
As an example of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX>'s success in specialized areas, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spethmann</ENAMEX> cited the plastics production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budd Co.</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Troy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, that has become a major profit center in recent years. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Budd</ENAMEX> has just received an order to build the body for the ``wave runner,'' a recreational item that is a sort of cross between a motorcycle and a surfboard, for a major Japanese customer. ``This is a real hit; they want to have more than one million units over a period of time,'' he said.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Budd</ENAMEX>'s profit will come under pressure next year from the regrouping of production lines and the launch of two new plants, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spethmann</ENAMEX> said.
Another unit with excellent prospects is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blohm & Voss AG</ENAMEX>, the shipbuilding subsidiary that recently received major orders from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> navies, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spethmann</ENAMEX> said. He also confirmed reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blohm & Voss</ENAMEX> is interested in acquiring the navy technology activities that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz AG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b. H.</ENAMEX> are required to sell as a condition of their merger.
