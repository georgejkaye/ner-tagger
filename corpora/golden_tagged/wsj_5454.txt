A group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward S. Buchanan</ENAMEX> said it will seek to elect three directors at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group Inc.</ENAMEX>'s annual meeting Oct. 25.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> maker of coatings, paint and household products, said it will ``vigorously oppose'' any such attempt by the group, which holds 9.4%.
In a filing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, the group said that if its nominees are elected, it plans to pursue ``the immediate sale of the company as the means most likely to enhance and to protect shareholder value.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX>'s board has nine members.
``Prompt action'' is necessary, the group said, because of ``continued poor performance by incumbent management'' following the termination of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> offer. Last September, a proposal under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG Industries</ENAMEX> would have acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX> fell through.
Grow said the dissidents threatened a proxy fight at last year's meeting.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX> shares closed at $11.875, down 25 cents.
