A group of investors, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Giancarlo Parretti</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pathe Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasea Holding S.A.</ENAMEX>, have agreed to buy 76.66% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon Finanziaria</ENAMEX>, a financially troubled Italian TV station.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio Fiorini</ENAMEX>, managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasea</ENAMEX>, said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station, ``but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating. It's sort of a Chapter 11 situation,'' he added, referring to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Odeon</ENAMEX>, which draws about 3% of Italian TV viewers, has debt of 250 billion lire ($181.9 million), Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiorini</ENAMEX> said. He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out, but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pathe</ENAMEX> will take 50% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Odeon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> film producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruno Lucisano</ENAMEX> will take 10% and the remaining 16.66%, currently owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasea</ENAMEX>, will eventually be sold to other investors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calisto Tanzi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Odeon</ENAMEX>'s owner, will retain his 23.34% stake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> this year ordered Parliament to write a law that will regulate media ownership. ``We think that it's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fiorini</ENAMEX> said.
