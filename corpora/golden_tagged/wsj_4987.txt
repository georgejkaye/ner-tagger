Displaying a talent for hype rarely seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club N.V.</ENAMEX> bills itself as ``a major contender for dominance in the world video market.''
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antwerp</ENAMEX>-based company is far from achieving that ambition, it is creating a stir in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> video-rental business by snapping up video stores at a fast-forward pace. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX>'s planned acquisition binge -- which industry people say is likely to total at least $120 million over the next few months -- would make the company the third-largest U.S. video-store operator by year end, behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Coast Video Ltd.</ENAMEX> By New Year's, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> expects to have 400 stores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, giving it a presence in almost every state.
``They have retailers very anxious about what they're doing, who they are and how much money they have,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Apar</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video Business</ENAMEX>, an industry magazine in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
With 44 U.S. stores already acquired, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> shows how a company can expand fast in a fragmented industry, dominated by small businesses, that is ripe for consolidation. As in other such situations, growth is slowing and many of the original entrepreneurs fear tougher competition.
The trend toward national chains like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> makes mom-and-pop operators nervous. In addition, some are starting to feel burned-out after riding the peak of the video-rental boom, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Appel</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video Insider</ENAMEX>, a newsletter. Thus, many of the smaller operators are expected to cash in at the first good opportunity, industry experts say.
``A lot of small chains are willing to sell quite cheaply now,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Abt</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> Video, which -- despite its name -- is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX>, having built up a highly profitable European chain in the early years of the video-rental business, now has the financial strength to gobble up small competitors. Its founder and chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurits De Prins</ENAMEX>, says his company's size and buying power allow it to hold costs 20% to 25% below those of a typical small operator.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> is attracted by the vast size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market -- revenue is expected to be $10 billion for 1989 -- and the well-developed American appetite for take-home films; more than 60% of all U.S. households have a videocassette recorder, and the percentage is expected to continue growing. Industry executives say total revenue from the 25,000 or so video stores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is likely to expand about 10% annually in the next few years. That rate is considered healthy, though it is far below the explosive growth of the early 1980s, when the business was new.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX> announced two weeks ago that the company is raising 2.5 billion Belgian francs ($61.4 million) through a bond issue being arranged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kredietbank N.V.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>. The proceeds, mostly earmarked for U.S. expansion, will provide only a fraction of the funds Super <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Club</ENAMEX> needs to fulfill its goals. The rest, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX>, will come from cash flow, reserves and other borrowings.
Early this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> spent about $6 million for an office building in north <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> to serve as a base for its fledgling U.S. subsidiary. The U.S. unit since has announced acquisitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Movietime/Alfalfa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Orleans</ENAMEX>, which operates 21 stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video Towne Entertainment</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, which has 22 stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>. Terms weren't disclosed.
This week, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX> says, the company should reach agreements on acquisitions involving about 150 more stores, bringing its U.S. total to 200. He declines to identify the acquisitions before agreements are in place.
Big competitors say they aren't quaking. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Gruber</ENAMEX> says, ``We're not very nervous.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gruber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX>'s chief marketing officer, predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX>'s outlets won't be ``in the same ballpark'' as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX>'s larger ``superstores.''
Moreover, he says, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> is making a mistake by letting the stores it acquires keep their old identities rather than establishing a single world-wide brand name. ``That's a very strange way to put together a chain,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gruber</ENAMEX> says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster</ENAMEX> has about 870 stores, all under its own name, and predicts it will have 1,000 by year end. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> Video has more than 700 stores. Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX>'s stores are franchised, as are about 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blockbuster's</ENAMEX>. For its part, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> says it won't franchise.
Though it is green in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> has built a formidable record in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. It has powerful connections at home, where it is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>'s largest video chain. The company's board includes the chairmen of both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kredietbank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>'s third-largest bank, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips N.V.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>, a unit of the Dutch electronics giant.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX>, 41 years old, founded the company six years ago. After stints in such diverse fields as mechanical engineering, computer programming, real estate and advertising, he was looking for a fast-growing business and settled on video. Once the choice was made, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX> rapidly opened stores offering a larger variety than most of the competition. He vowed to increase revenue and profit by at least 2.5 times each year. So far, he says, that goal has been met.
For 1989, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX> predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> will post net income of at least 1.5 billion francs on sales of more than eight billion francs.
Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the company has smaller video-distribution and other film interests in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>. Though the operations outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> are mostly in the early stages of development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> says it's the largest video chain in the highly fragmented European market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> is next: Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX> says he hopes to have a presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> by the end of next year.
To help finance its rapid growth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> is considering going public with a listing on one or more European stock  exchanges within the next 18 months.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX> also is diversifying. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> dabbles in advertising, magazine publishing and travel agencies, and it plans to build domed resorts with swimming pools and other sporting facilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>.
But the main focus is on films. Aside from its stores, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> distributes video films through about 1,000 vending machines, designed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX>.
On a much grander scale, he wants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Club</ENAMEX> to be an ``integrated'' entertainment company. Thus, the company is buying video rights to films, developing multiscreen movie theaters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> and investing in movie production. The company has bankrolled a couple of local movies, but its biggest project is an investment of $2 million to $3 million in ``Wait Until Spring, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bandini</ENAMEX>,'' a U.S. film starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faye Dunaway</ENAMEX>, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX> says will be released this fall.
Could Super Club get carried away with the glamour of show biz? Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Prins</ENAMEX>, deadpan, says: ``There's no way we'd go on a wild ride.
