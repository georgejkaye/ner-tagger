Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> flight in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>: a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk.
For several months, officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight. The explosion sent shards of metal flying, severing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DC</ENAMEX>-10's hydraulic or control systems, and led to the crash that killed 112 people.
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sioux City Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>. The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sioux City</ENAMEX>. Among the issues the board will examine is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX>, should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks. The engine involved was a CF6-6 made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Broderick</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as ``hard alpha'' -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago. He said there wasn't any way to detect the flaw at that time, and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> already has ordered that all 232 disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber. Such tests make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> confident that a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sioux City</ENAMEX>-type accident ``won't happen again,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX>. A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> said that the company has been working with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> all along on this issue and ``will comply fully with the required inspections.'' But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s engine production. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CF6</ENAMEX>-6 series engines aren't being manufactured any more; they are only being used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DC</ENAMEX>-10 Series 10 planes currently in service, he said.
