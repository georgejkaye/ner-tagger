<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank B. Hall</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">& Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Briarcliff Manor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, said it entered into a definitive agreement to sell one million new convertible preferred shares to its largest shareholder, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>, for $50 million.
The insurance brokerage firm said its audit committee approved issuance of the shares without shareholder approval under an exception to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> rules; the exception permits such action when delay would ``seriously jeopardize the financial viability of the enterprise.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Bell</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the funds would strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s financial position and provide working capital.
About 74% of Hall is held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Group</ENAMEX>, controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Steinberg</ENAMEX>. Hall in August reported a second-quarter loss of $60.8 million, largely because of charges related to discontinued operations.
Dividends on the preferred may be paid in Hall common, an option that will be used for the ``foreseeable future,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> said.
