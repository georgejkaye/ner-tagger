The ruling Liberal Democratic Party won an important by-election victory that could mark the beginning of a turnaround in the party's sagging fortunes.
At the very least, the victory will give the LDP considerable maneuvering room in deliberations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Diet</ENAMEX>, or parliament, as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> prepares for nationwide lower-house elections sometime in the next several months.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDP</ENAMEX> could either decide to capitalize on the victory and go to the voters early, as some of its members advocate. Or it could first introduce a plan to revise an unpopular new consumption tax and aim for elections early next year, as other members are demanding.
The triumph is especially sweet for the beleaguered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDP</ENAMEX> because its margin of victory was larger than expected. The ruling party's candidate to fill a vacant upper-house Diet seat in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ibaraki</ENAMEX> prefecture outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itsuo Nomura</ENAMEX>, garnered more votes than the combined total of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Socialist Party</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Communist Party</ENAMEX> candidates opposing him. Polls had suggested the race would be neck and neck.
The election was the first since the nationwide elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LDP</ENAMEX> lost its majority in the upper house for the first time in 34 years. That defeat was due in part to the introduction of the new tax and in part to sex and money scandals that had thrown Japanese politics into turmoil for much of the last year.
