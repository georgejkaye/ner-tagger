<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ENGRAPH INC.</ENAMEX> recently reported third-quarter earnings, which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in last Tuesday's edition to be lower than the average of analysts' estimates. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zacks Investment Research</ENAMEX> didn't adjust one analyst's estimate for a stock split, which therefore was artificially high. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engraph</ENAMEX>'s third-quarter net income of 15 cents a share actually was 7% higher than the adjusted average of estimates.
