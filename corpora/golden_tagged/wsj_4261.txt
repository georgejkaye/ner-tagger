The majestic rock you see pictured, rising 1,500 feet from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans-Pecos</ENAMEX> plain, is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Capitan</ENAMEX>, pride of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadalupe Mountains</ENAMEX>. Because its limestone face is too ``soft'' to hold the pitons that mountaineers use to hoist themselves in difficult places, it has been scaled rarely, and only by experts. I did not climb it.
I did, however, climb that small-appearing bump at the far right of the frame. That's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe Peak</ENAMEX> and, believe it or not, it's about 700 feet higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Capitan</ENAMEX>. It's all  a matter of perspective.
Now, you might ask why our illustration features <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Capitan</ENAMEX> while this story is about gentler-sloping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe Peak</ENAMEX>. The answer is that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Capitan</ENAMEX> makes a better picture. Gotta sell those newspapers
You also might be curious about why a sensible fellow like me would want to climb a mountain of any height or configuration. That answer is a bit more complicated. Part one is that scaling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe Peak</ENAMEX> requires stamina but no technical skill; it's really just a vertical hike. Part two is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Sokolov</ENAMEX>, who proposed the expedition, is the editor of this page. In other words, he's my boss.
In August, 1985, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> and I hiked up 14,421-foot Mount Massive in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>, or, more accurately, about 14,300 feet of it. That was long enough ago for me to forget the blisters and sore muscles, but not long enough to have forgotten the beauty of the place and my pleasure over making it as far as we did, so I assented. The same thinking process, I suppose, explains why some women have more than one child.
We picked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe Peak</ENAMEX> because at 8,751 feet it's the highest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> (]), it's climbable by an average person (me), and its situation in a northern finger of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chihuahua</ENAMEX> Desert provided an unusual mix of mountain and desert scenery. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> location also allowed us to inveigle some local talent from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Monthly magazine</ENAMEX>, an estimable publication, to mosey up from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, interpret local speech and share expertise in general, as we raced them to the summit.
Besides, we would fly into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Paso</ENAMEX>, just across the border from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Juarez</ENAMEX>, and the Mexican food there is wonderful. That last point was especially persuasive.
More information came in a chat with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Valen</ENAMEX>, chief of interpretation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe Mountains National Park</ENAMEX>. He explained that the range, running about 50 miles northward from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, is geologically interesting because it isn't composed of volcanic igneous rock, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX>, but the sedimentary variety, caused by the accumulation of lime deposits.
The lime came from the shells of zillions of aquatic beasties; millions of years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guadalupe Peak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Capitan</ENAMEX> were, first, part of an ocean reef, and, then, cliffs on the shore. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valens</ENAMEX> noted that sea could replace desert here again, but surmised that it might be a bit premature to start building a marina.
More recently, the mountains were home to the Mescalero <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apache</ENAMEX>, who believed their gods dwelled on its summits, and the peaks were skirted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butterfield</ENAMEX> stagecoach route. They contain no precious metals, but around 1900 a man named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Long</ENAMEX> found a chest of gold coins in a cave in one of their canyons. No dummy, he used them to buy a ranch in cool, green <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>.
Our expedition began with a disappointment for me. I was met late last Monday afternoon at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Paso</ENAMEX> airport by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Monthly</ENAMEX> guys, senior editor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Harrigan</ENAMEX> and art director D.J. Stout. The three had arrived earlier and lunched in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Juarez</ENAMEX>, and, still burping, didn't feel like a repeat.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray</ENAMEX> tried to assuage my hurt by offering me a bag of a barbequed pork rinds to eat on the ride to our lodgings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White's City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.M.</ENAMEX>, 135 miles thence. All Texans, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>, loved'em loved'em, he assured me. One handful, though, was enough to both confirm my general opinion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and make me suspect that my companions didn't want to give me a head start, stomachwise, the next day.
That day dawned soon enough, hot and clear, and we were at the trail head, elevation 5,800 feet, at 7:45 a.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrigan</ENAMEX>'s contribution to the expedition became clear: Something of a naturalist, he identified the local flora as we climbed, and our pauses to admire it gave us chances to catch our breath without appearing to seek them.
Stout, young and exuberant, supplied thrills by venturing to the edges of rocky precipices. The rest of us told him we'd voted, 2-to-1, to go after him if he fell.
The abundance of desert plant life -- mainly sticklike cholla cactus, plump prickly pear and sharp-leafed agave -- was in contrast to the apparent absence of fauna. I inquired of Valen about this later, and was told that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupes</ENAMEX> are home to many animal species, including raccoon, skunk, mule deer and, even, mountain lion, they were mostly nocturnal feeders with more sense than to be out in 90-degree sunshine like us.
Sweaty but triumphant, we reached the top around 11 a.m. to find a glorious view of the arid landscape, a metal pyramid bearing the symbols of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Postal Service</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> that (strangely, we thought) honored pioneer aviators, and a box containing a log for recording climbers' impressions. We scanned its contents, and along with the usual stuff (``Made it '') found some poetry by a woman named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belinda</ENAMEX>, who'd been there just the day before.
``Mountain, I want to be in you. Together we could grow wild and natural things,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belinda</ENAMEX> wrote, among other, much -- steamier, lines.
The way down was easier on the lungs than the way up, but harder on the legs, and the rocks underfoot felt sharper. That's the main part I'd forgotten from last time. But down we loped, blooming blisters or no, and in much better time than it had taken to ascend. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gravity</ENAMEX> favored us, and beer beckoned. And there was the thought that, if we hurried, we might catch up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belinda</ENAMEX>.
For the record, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX>, as lead climber for the Journal team, pushed his way past the others, trampling the lunch of two hikers in his black army boots, and won the race to the summit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Monthly</ENAMEX> pair made it first to the parking lot. Who won? The dispute has been submitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulitzer Prize Alpine Committee</ENAMEX> for arbitration. -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX>.
