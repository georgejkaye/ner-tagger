<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX>'s chairman said he is discussing a possible merger or alliance with two suitors as one way to resolve the financial crisis at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s third-biggest defense electronics contractor.
In an interview last night, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Alun-Jones</ENAMEX> said, ``We have a few discussions going'' with one British and one continental European suitor. He declined to name the potential allies, but said a partnership with either of them ``makes a good deal of business sense.'' Either company, he said, might inject needed capital into Ferranti in exchange for a shareholding whose size has yet to be determined.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek</ENAMEX>'s comments suggest a resolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s 10-day-old crisis may be near. On Sept. 11, the company stunned investors and defense officials -- who regard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> as a linchpin supplier of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s electronic warfare arsenal -- with a stock-trading suspension and news that its financial accounts may have overstated profits and assets. Since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> has said it is examining possible accounting fraud at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal & Control Group PLC</ENAMEX>, with which Ferranti merged last year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal</ENAMEX>'s accounts, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek</ENAMEX> said, ``reflected a profit record that was undoubtedly untrue and a level of assets that weren't there.'' Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> subsequently consolidated those inflated figures in its own financial statements, he said, ``We are going to end up with a hole in our net worth'' as great as # 150 million ($235.6 million) to # 200 million. That's about half the company's reported net worth of # 370.8 million as of last March 31.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Guerin</ENAMEX>, the former head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal</ENAMEX>, issued his first public comments since the scandal erupted last week. He didn't respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s allegations of fraud, but attacked what he called ``inflammatory and blatantly incorrect'' news reports about activities at his former company.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek</ENAMEX> emphasized that the difference in net worth is on paper only and doesn't represent any immediate drain on the company's cash flow. He said it doesn't appear any cash was drained out of the company through embezzlement or illegal kickbacks. Still, he acknowledged, the company is in talks with its bankers to ensure they don't cut back <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s credit lines as a result of the reduced net worth.
The talks toward a merger or partnership, he said, are one possible avenue for Ferranti to restore its net worth and appease the bankers. Another option, he said, is to raise cash by selling Ferranti assets. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> financial analysts believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> has little choice but to arrange a speedy merger. ``They don't seem to be in a strong {bargaining} position,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Armitage</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley International.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> shareholders ``seem to be screaming for blood.''
The list of potential merger candidates is long. Front-runners, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> analysts believe, include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace PLC</ENAMEX>, the nation's largest defense contractor, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dowty Group PLC</ENAMEX>, a rapidly growing defense-electronics supplier. Abroad, candidates favored by analysts includee <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson SA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz AG</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson</ENAMEX>, controlled by the French government, would have difficulty shepherding so risky a deal as a Ferranti merger through tightfisted French <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> officials. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz</ENAMEX> has previously denied any talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s problems are further complicated by the fact that there is a sudden glut of British defense businesses up for sale this year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorn</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI PLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racal Electronics PLC</ENAMEX> are also seeking buyers for their defense-electronics businesses. With these units competing for buyers' attention, any potential Ferranti partner would be able to drive a hard bargain with the British company.
