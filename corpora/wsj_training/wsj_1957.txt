Japanese investors, reassured by Monday's strong rally on Wall Street, erased most of that day's losses on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. But analysts said the rebound didn't remove the cautious mood from the market.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, stocks closed lower in volatile trading as an opening rally was obliterated by worse-than-expected U.S. trade figures. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> shares had a similar reaction, but most other European bourses posted gains, as did all major Asian and Pacific stock markets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> Index of 225 stocks jumped 527.39 points to close at 34996.08. The rise came a day after the year's biggest drop on Monday, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> fell 647.33, or 1.8%, in response to Friday's 6.9% plunge on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>.
In early trading Wednesday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index rose 19.30 points to 35015.38.
On Tuesday, the broader-based <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Stock Price Index of issues listed in the first section, which fell 45.66 Monday, rose 41.76, or 1.61%, to 2642.64. Trading was relatively thin at an estimated 650 million shares, though brisker than Monday's 526 million. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 821-201, with 103 unchanged.
``We're back to square one,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon Smithson</ENAMEX>, an analyst in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinwort Benson International Inc.</ENAMEX>
Japanese domestic institutions, including trust banks and investment management firms, that had been on the sidelines during Monday's fall were back in the market, analysts said. Foreign investors reportedly started off selling but later joined in the buying.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> rally seemed to confirm the view, frequently expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> in the past few days, that the drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> was a local problem related to merger and acquisition activity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
``This time we don't really have to worry about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>,'' said an official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa Securities Co.</ENAMEX> ``Nothing has changed fundamentally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market.''
But even though <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> appears unharmed by recent market volatility, analysts and traders say there are still a few concerns on the horizon. In particular, Japanese investors will be keeping a wary eye on Wall Street to see whether Monday's 88.12-point rally holds up as fresh U.S. economic data are released.
``People are placing small bets. There's no huge buying,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hill</ENAMEX>, head of equity sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. ``Really brave views right now would be foolhardy.''
Yesterday's buyers favored real estate, construction and other large-capitalization issues, reflecting the fact that many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> investors now feel safer with domestically oriented stocks, analysts said.
They also are concerned about the persistent strength of the dollar against the yen, as a weaker yen leads to higher import prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and adds to domestic inflationary pressures.
Currency concerns also weigh heavily on interest rate-sensitive stocks such as banking and other financial issues because of fears that Japanese interest rates might have to rise to keep the dollar in check.
Among steel shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NKK</ENAMEX> rose 19 to 705 yen ($4.97) a share, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Steel</ENAMEX> gained 17 to 735. Construction shares that gained included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shimizu</ENAMEX>, which rose 130 to 2,080. In the real estate sector, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui Real Estate Development</ENAMEX> was up 100 at 2,760, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX> gained 80 to 2,360.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 100-share index fell 27.9 points to 2135.5. It was down more than 40 points a half-hour before the close, marking a 61.5-point turnaround from its high, reached in the first 15 minutes of trading. The narrower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 30-share index fell 29.6 to 1730.7. Volume was an active 643.3 million shares, about double the recent levels but down from 959.3 million the previous day, which U.K. traders have dubbed ``Manic Monday.''
Prices opened strongly on the basis of Monday's Wall Street rally and yesterday's gains in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. But the advance faltered as index-options traders and investors jittery about the U.K. economic outlook took over. The unexpectedly wide U.S. August trade deficit of $10.77 billion hit an already jittery <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> market in midafternoon.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Hicks</ENAMEX>, who manages sales and trading for brokerage concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull</ENAMEX>, said: ``It's a nervous market. It was all over the place. If you bought, you wish you hadn't, and if you sold, you wish you hadn't.'' He said the current market ``is all about sentiment, and the sentiment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> is 90% anxiety and worry.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s economic fundamentals, he said, ``don't look very bright.''
Dealers said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> showed signs of calming in midafternoon after Wall Street avoided sharp losses despite the trade report, but a wave of futures-related selling later in the session sent buyers back to the sidelines. Still, some sectors found buying interest after being actively sold in recent weeks.
Merchant banks were stronger across the board. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell</ENAMEX>, which has been mentioned in takeover rumors, rose 20 to 392 pence ($6.18) a share. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.G. Warburg</ENAMEX>, a rumored target of some European banking concerns, finished 22 higher at 400. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambros</ENAMEX> rose 5 to 204, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schroders</ENAMEX> rose 25 to # 12.75.
On the corporate front, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX> announced that it raised its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> luxury car maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> to 10.4% from 5%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares jumped 23 before easing to close at 654, up 6.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amstrad</ENAMEX>, a British computer hardware and communications equipment maker, eased 4 to 47. It announced a 52% plunge in pretax profit for the latest year.
Brewery stocks were firm to higher on talk of early bargain-hunting, but most ended below their peaks. Bass ended up 3 higher at 966, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness</ENAMEX> closed at 589, down 7, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish & Newcastle</ENAMEX> dropped 11 to 359, but Whitbread Class A shares rose 17 to 363. Dealers said there was late talk of a Whitbread sale of brewing operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish & Newcastle</ENAMEX>.
The most active shares were major blue-chips, particularly oils and utilities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Gas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecommunications</ENAMEX>. Traders attributed the action in them largely to defensive positioning in a volatile market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Gas</ENAMEX> finished at 197, down 2, on 13 million shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Petroleum</ENAMEX> fell 8 to 291 on 9.4 million shares, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX> was 4 lower at 261 on turnover of 10 million shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable & Wireless</ENAMEX> fell 20 to 478.
Also in active trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Steel</ENAMEX> fell 1 to 124 as 20 million shares changed hands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racal Electric</ENAMEX>, which traded 11 million shares, declined 12 to 218.
In other European markets, share prices closed sharply higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX> and posted moderate rises in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stockholm</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris</ENAMEX> closed lower, and most <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> shares were unable to trade for a second consecutive day because of technical problems. South African gold stocks closed higher.
Elsewhere, share prices rebounded in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> -- the largest of those exchanges -- stocks recovered one-third to one-half of the ground they lost in Monday's plunge, with major market indexes posting gains of 3.6% to 4.4%.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.
