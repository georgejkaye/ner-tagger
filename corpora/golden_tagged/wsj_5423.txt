<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX> will pay $15 million to 375 former company managers in a settlement that was approved by a state court judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
At issue in the suit was a management-incentive plan, which was dissolved after 1970, under which management employees were entitled to cash payments equivalent to dividends paid to stockholders.
In 1986, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, sold its Consumer Product businesses in a successful attempt to fight off a hostile takeover by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Corp.</ENAMEX>, it made a special payment to stockholders. The payment prompted retired managers, who were covered by the incentive plan, to contend that they were entitled to the special payment.
In an unusual move, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide</ENAMEX> sued a class of the former employees in order ``to get the entire problem in one place so that it could be addressed locally and hopefully settled,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Krohley</ENAMEX>, a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kelley, Drye & Warren</ENAMEX>, which represents the company. The company sought a ruling that the board's decision not to issue the payments to retirees was correct.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick T. Davis</ENAMEX>, who represented the class of former employees, said his clients ``settled for roughly 50 cents on the dollar.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Supreme Court</ENAMEX> Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Wilk</ENAMEX> awarded Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX>'s firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patterson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belknap</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webb & Tyler</ENAMEX>, $660,000 in legal fees.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> said he believes this was the only litigation ever filed over a ``dividend equivalent'' plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PATTON</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOGGS & BLOW</ENAMEX> is a limited partner in a new 1992 consulting firm.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, law firm is one of the backers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denman & Partners</ENAMEX>, which will advise companies on strategic-planning issues related to the opening trade borders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>. The new consulting firm, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Patton Boggs</ENAMEX>' offices, will also advise companies on merger and acquisition opportunities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denman & Partners</ENAMEX> was co-founded by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Denman</ENAMEX>, who until recently was the Head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delegation of the Commission</ENAMEX> of the European Communities to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, essentially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>'s ambassador to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilliard A. Zola</ENAMEX>, who is of counsel to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patton Boggs</ENAMEX>, is the other general partner. Limited partners include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris L. Chucas</ENAMEX>, who practices law in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cherry Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Symington</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> congressman who is a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connor & Hannon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
``I felt there was a great deal to be done in informing American companies about what was going to happen in 1992 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>,'' said Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy</ENAMEX>. He said he wanted to affiliate with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> firm because he needed ``expert advise and counsel in legal affairs.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denman & Partners</ENAMEX> plans to open a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> office before year end.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patton Boggs</ENAMEX> is known for its trade practice. Its managing partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy May</ENAMEX>, said the firm will turn to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denman & Partners</ENAMEX> when clients need advice on European problems.
Said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">May</ENAMEX>: ``We were looking for a window on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> short of opening an office or acquiring a firm.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAREER ADVANCEMENT</ENAMEX> is a hot topic at in-house lawyers meeting at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy A. Zoghby</ENAMEX>, general counsel at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, struck a responsive chord this week when he told 43 in-house lawyers attending a seminar at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuqua School of Business</ENAMEX>, ``I believe a dual ladder is essential'' in rewarding highly valued lawyers who have little chance to become senior managers in corporations.
By dual ladder, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoghby</ENAMEX> was referring to a two-track hierarchical structure which allows staff lawyers to reach the equivalent of senior-management status. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inhouse</ENAMEX> law departments are small, usually employing no more than 50 lawyers. Only a handful of the lawyers can hope to help run a corporate-law department.
So how does a general counsel keep proven talent happy? By persuading top management to create an alternative path for advancement, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoghby</ENAMEX>.
When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zoghby</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> two years ago, he pushed for a dual ladder so that his most experienced lawyers would be eligible for senior-management benefits such as stock options, bonuses, higher salaries and larger office space. The company's top executives agreed.
At the 52-lawyer legal department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Springfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, a dual track has been in place for 16 years, said associate general counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth S. Cohen</ENAMEX>, who attended the Duke seminar. Lawyers not involved in management are eligible for perks and can participate in senior level decision-making, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> says.
Two years ago <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey Foods Corp.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, began offering lawyers with a minimum of 12-years experience the chance to attain managerial perks, a top salary of $200,000 and the title of senior counsel. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey</ENAMEX>'s assistant general counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Reese</ENAMEX> cautioned against dismissing a new title as trivial. ``Lawyers value recognition and professional pride and self-esteem as much as a salary increase,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WEDTECH</ENAMEX> ASKS for summary judgment in suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E. Robert Wallach</ENAMEX>.
The defunct defense contractor has asked a federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> to grant a summary judgment in its racketeering suit against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallach</ENAMEX> and his co-defendants. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallach</ENAMEX> was the former confidant and personal legal advisor to ex-Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Meese</ENAMEX>.
Last month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W. Franklyn Chinn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Kent London</ENAMEX> were found guilty of racketeering, fraud and conspiracy. The three men were charged with receiving illegal payments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> in return for trying to influence Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meese</ENAMEX> and other federal officials on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX>, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, sued the three defendants in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> in July 1987. The suit was later moved to federal district court. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> accused the defendants of racketeering and common-law fraud.
In its motion, filed yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> said the defendants are prohibited by law from denying their criminal acts because of their convictions. The company said a court should therefore summarily rule in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> seeks to recover millions of dollars from the defendants.
The defendants have vowed to appeal the convictions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Naftalis</ENAMEX>, an attorney for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallach</ENAMEX>, said, ``We are very confident <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Wallach</ENAMEX>'s unfounded conviction will be set aside and that this lawsuit will be proved meritless.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COCAINE DEALERS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> can be prosecuted for second-degree murder if a customer dies of an overdose, according to a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision. But the ruling was hardly a victory for prosecutors. In the 4-3 vote, the justices also said prosecutors must be able to prove there was a ``high probability'' that the person who took cocaine would die. In dissenting opinions Chief Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Lucas</ENAMEX> and two other justices said such a rigid standard of proof would discourage such cases against dealers. The justice who wrote the majority opinion said the legislature -- and not the courts -- should encourage the use of second-degree murder charges as a deterence to drug dealers.
