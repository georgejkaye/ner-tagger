<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX>, whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX> earlier this year, will see its profit margins bounce back to the ``11.5% range'' in 1990, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX>, the agency's new chairman-elect.
The ad agency's pretax profit margins were slightly under 10% at the time of the takeover, according to analysts; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX>'s goal is to increase margins to 12%.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency. British-born, the 24-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> veteran was named last week to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Roman</ENAMEX>, who is leaving by year's end to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> client. Surrounded by stacks of paper, two computers and photos of himself boating and flying, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First and foremost</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> said he hopes to improve client service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> under the fastidious Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients, of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed, must -- follow. And some of its top client-service executives, including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX>, were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties, with little time to see clients.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy. He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> was closer to, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lever Brothers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins. ``Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month, but two or three times a week,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX> takeover. The reorganization is supposed to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising, public relations and design all in one place, or ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Orchestration</ENAMEX>'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ogilvyspeak</ENAMEX> -- a reality.
Under the reorganization, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> plans to name one executive on each account as a ``client service director'' to work as the client's single contact for all those services. ``There is little or no integration of our work, quality is spotty, there is no single focus,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> complained to staffers in March, when the reorganization was announced. Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryder</ENAMEX> -- by year's end.
Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> is up to the task. He isn't as well-known to clients as is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>. Under his watch, office politicking was often rampant in the agency's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year. And while last week the agency hired a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiat</ENAMEX>\ executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Hamilton</ENAMEX>, to try to bolster its work, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> has to get the revenue of that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office moving,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dougherty</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Natwest Securities.</ENAMEX>
The one thing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> clearly does have going for him is continuity, although it isn't certain if that will be enough. As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dougherty</ENAMEX> says, ``The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top... and Graham is obviously a long-term member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy Mafia</ENAMEX>, as we call it.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> are indeed quite similar in substance, if not in style. While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> is a workaholic detailsman, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> would rather delegate, leaving him time for his interests outside the office. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>, by contrast, seems rarely to cut loose at all, although he did appear at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX>'s Halloween party Friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat, costumed as a ``lame duck.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> said the company's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable, given that the company's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious, oversized new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> headquarters. The move, budgeted at about $7 million, actually came in at about $10 million, he said.
But margins will be helped, too, by some other cost-saving steps. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> eliminated the mail room staff, closed the executive dining room and, after the takeover, let go half a dozen financial executives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX>, which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way, instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX>'s new headquarters building to outsiders. The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company, under British accounting rules, will also make the profit picture look better.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y&R's Klein Steps</ENAMEX> Down
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Klein</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office, stepped down ``temporarily'' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Haven</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, that he, the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981.
In an internal memo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kroll</ENAMEX>, the agency's chairman, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> decided to remove himself to minimize ``negative reaction'' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense. ``The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y&R</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kroll</ENAMEX> wrote. He said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> will return to his post at the end of the trial ``at which he will be vindicated.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> will work with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kroll</ENAMEX> on some of the agency's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Georgescu</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y&R</ENAMEX>'s ad operations, will assume Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX>'s day-to-day role.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Partner</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells, Rich, Greene</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl Heller</ENAMEX> as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group, which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX>, 38, had headed up Boston agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heller\</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>. The agency, with about $35 million in billings, will be dissolved, with some of its staffers absorbed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina Mcnamee</ENAMEX> unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> said. She said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> will concentrate on accounts that include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris's Benson & Hedges</ENAMEX> cigarette brand, which relies on print ads, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX>'s specialty. As previously reported, the account is troubled, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX>, and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the status of the account, as did the other agencies.
