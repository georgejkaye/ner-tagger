<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale's</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Traub</ENAMEX> is talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX> about a leveraged buy-out of the famed department store chain, according to those familiar with the situation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, a 17-store chain acquired last year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> in its $6.6 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores</ENAMEX>, was put up for sale two weeks ago as part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> plan to ease a debt crunch.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s longtime top executive, first tried to put together a buy-out when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> made its bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated.</ENAMEX> His current effort faces competition from an array of retailing concerns, some of which are believed ready to pay higher prices than could be supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s revenue and profit alone.
This possible ``trophy pricing'' could hinder Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX>'s attempt. He is understood to be discussing a possible role for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> as financial adviser and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter G. Peterson</ENAMEX> as an investor. But papers haven't been signed yet. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> financial advisory and investment banking firm.
Some Wall Street observers have speculated that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> might try to duplicate the strategy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macy's</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Finkelstein</ENAMEX> in attracting a group of wealthy investors to finance a leveraged bid, without the involvement of a firm specializing in leveraged buy-outs. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finkelstein</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macy</ENAMEX> buy-out with backing from investors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> real estate mogul <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Taubman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> Chief Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Tisch</ENAMEX> and mutual-fund whiz <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Price</ENAMEX>.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> doesn't provide profit breakdowns, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s is estimated to have annual sales of $1.2 billion. The high price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> paid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX>, financed mainly with junk bonds, has been the main reason for the cash crunch.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Commerce Secretary</ENAMEX>, are old friends. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> was a director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> from 1973 until 1988. He joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone</ENAMEX> in 1985 after leaving his post as chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.</ENAMEX>
Other luminaries at Blackstone include former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> budget director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Stockman</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen A. Schwarzman</ENAMEX>, president, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger C. Altman</ENAMEX>, vice chairman, who both previously worked in mergers and acquisitions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehman.</ENAMEX> Last December, Blackstone sold a 20% stake to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Securities Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> for $100 million.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> was unavailable to comment. A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham</ENAMEX> declined to comment. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached to comment.
It was unclear why Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX> is seeking to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> solely as a financial adviser rather than as a provider of junk bonds, which is one of its specialties. It also couldn't be determined whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone</ENAMEX>'s own leveraged buy-out fund would supply equity for any bid.
Some analysts have estimated that a sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s would bring $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Among those expected to bid for the retailer are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Brooks</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of specialty retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ann Taylor Inc.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s is said to be thriving in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> metropolitan area but experiencing some problems in its stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, area.
``It's a complex business to manage,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Posner</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based retail consultant. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s must continue to present the image of having unique merchandise, yet those goods have to be salable enough to generate big volume. On one hand you need to provide showmanship every day; on the other, expenses have to be managed. You can save $1 million in expenses but lose five times that amount in sales because you've destroyed the shopping experience,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Posner</ENAMEX> said.
