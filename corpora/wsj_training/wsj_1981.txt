<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> division, reacting to slow sales, said it will offer $800 rebates on its 1990 Beretta, the two-door version of its core compact-car line.
Sluggish sales of the Beretta, and its four-door sister car, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corsica</ENAMEX>, prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> to idle the two plants that build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corsica</ENAMEX> and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX>, but sales of the vehicles are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34% during early October.
Chevrolet already is offering an $800 rebate on the 1990-model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corsica</ENAMEX>. The latest rebate is good for all Beretta models. Chevrolet buyers can take the rebate, or get discount financing at rates ranging from 6.9% on 24-month loans to 10.9% on 60-month loans.
