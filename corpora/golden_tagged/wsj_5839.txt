I was very concerned to see a table entitled ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World-Wide Tax Revolution</ENAMEX>'' showing an inaccurate figure for the top rate of personal income tax in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> (editorial page, Aug. 29).
The past five years have seen a dramatic reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> tax rates. The main rate of corporate tax has been reduced to 35%, which is one of the lowest rates in the industrialized world. The rate is even lower for small companies with taxable profits of up to # 750,000. There also has been a significant reduction in personal tax rates in this period. The basic personal tax rate is 25% with a single higher rate of only 40%. This top rate of 40% is the lowest top rate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>.
