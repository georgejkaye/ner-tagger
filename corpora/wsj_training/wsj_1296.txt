At least 10 states are resisting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>'s nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles, and some might instead try to revoke the firm's license to sell securities within their borders.
The reluctance of some states to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> off the hook could hamper the firm's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month, say several people familiar with the discussions.
Up to now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>. Just yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> announced it made a $75,000 settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state. These states have been entering into settlements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> as part of the firm's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> despite its record as an admitted felon.
But individuals familiar with the generally successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>. Officials in some of these states say they don't want to simply accept the settlements offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>. They question if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> that includes payment of $650 million in penalties. These stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, the District of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> have been less resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> than the other six states, but nonetheless have refused to settle so far, say those familiar with the discussions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> says it doesn't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked, and even if some are, its securities business wouldn't be directly hurt. It already has sold its retail, or individual-investor, brokerage network; securities firms don't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking.
Still, if nothing else, a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> could be involved.
Securities regulators praise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> for its energetic effort, led by government-approved general counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul S. Cohen</ENAMEX>, to settle its legal problems with the states. But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public.
``There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Bryant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>'s chief securities regulator and president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American Securities Administrators Association</ENAMEX>, which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>. The question, she said, is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> should be allowed to pay and move on, or ``whether you should (simply) revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony.''
While Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX>'s state went ahead and accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s settlement offer of $25,000, she said: ``I don't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions. I can see both sides.''
Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alfred Rubega, New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s director of securities regulation, said his state hadn't received any complaints about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, so it really couldn't press the issue. Still, ``I understand the reasons'' that other states are holding out, he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> general counsel, said, ``I don't think, as we say in investment banking, that `by the end of the day' we'll be losing any licenses.'' Asked about states that are taking a hard line, he said, ``There are states that have asked for additional information, which we are providing to them.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said more than $2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> still expects to pay out a total of $11.5 million. By the end of this week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> should have another three to four settlements, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said.
``The rate we're going, I think that by the end of the month, we're looking to have a total of 30 to 35,'' he said.
That total would be important for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>. The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry. A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday.
There are, according to several securities commissioners, at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> or who don't appear opposed to settling.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s proposed state fines have been based on a state's population and on the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s business in the state.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, for example, was asked to accept $300,000, but refused. The state isn't ruling out revoking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s brokerage license. The state can also bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> as an investment adviser. State officials won't describe their position in detail, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mclelland Smith</ENAMEX>, state securities chief, said: ``We really are still looking at it and have informed (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> already has issued a ``notice of intent'' to revoke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s brokerage license. It is one of the states that have met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> and asked for additional information about investors' accounts and other matters. ``This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market,'' state Banking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Commissioner Howard Brown</ENAMEX> said. A banking department spokesman added: ``Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> doesn't feel that money alone is the issue here.''
Particularly touchy are the cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s base, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, the base of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm's legal difficulties. Neither state has settled, and officials in the two states won't discuss their reasons for not doing so. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked, according to state officials.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX>, the head of the state securities group, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has done a better job of settling with the states than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.F. Hutton</ENAMEX> did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago. Still, she said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s trouble with some states isn't a bad thing.
``This process should point out that it's not going to be easy for a firm that's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> said. ``We need to have somebody worried so they don't do this again.''
These are the 26 states, including the commonwealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, that have settled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Dakota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Dakota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vermont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>.
