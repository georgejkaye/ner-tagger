It was the second anniversary of the 1987 crash, but this time it was different. Stocks rallied on good earnings reports and on data that showed less inflation than expected.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX> chips led the march up in heavy trading. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average rose 39.55 points to 2683.20. The 30 industrials led the market higher from the opening bell as foreign buyers stepped in. By afternoon, the broader market joined the advance in full strength. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s 500-stock Index rose 5.37 to 347.13 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.52 to 470.80. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume swelled to 198,120,000 shares.
The industrials were up about 60 points in the afternoon, but cautious investors took profits before the close.
Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally. The consumer price index rose 0.2% in September, while many economists were looking for a 0.4% increase. Stock-index arbitrage buy programs -- in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences -- helped the rally's momentum.
The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>, while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX>, analysts said.
Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday's rally, traders said. Institutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher.
To the amazement of some traders, takeover stocks were climbing again. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> rose 2 7/8 to 100, for example. Last Friday, takeover traders spilled out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton</ENAMEX>, knocking the stock down 21 1/2 to 85. Among other stocks involved in restructurings or rumored to be so: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holiday Corp.</ENAMEX> gained 1 7/8 to 73 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honeywell</ENAMEX> rose 2 7/8 to 81 1/2.
One floor trader noted in astonishment that nobody seemed to mind the news that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> isn't making a special effort to revive the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out. The announcement of the buy-out's troubles triggered the market's nose dive a week ago.
Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its $1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical International.</ENAMEX> ``That's put some oomph back into this market,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Vandenberg</ENAMEX>, a vice president of equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton.</ENAMEX>
But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye. ``There is no strength behind this rally,'' asserted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung Lew</ENAMEX>, head trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinwort Benson North America</ENAMEX>. ``It's traders squaring positions. It's not good; the market is setting up for another fall.''
Indeed, many traders said that uncertainty about today's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options, and options on individual stocks, prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices.
The number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMI</ENAMEX> is a 20-stock index that mimics the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average. Outstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated. By Wednesday, the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524, representing about $1.13 billion in stock, noted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Selkin</ENAMEX>, head of stock-index futures research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX>, who expects a volatile expiration today. ``There has been a tremendous increase'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMI</ENAMEX> positions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selkin</ENAMEX> said.
Consumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> added 1 1/8 to 44 1/2 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite trading of 3.7 million shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> gained 2 3/8 to 70 3/8, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> gained 1 3/8 to 77 3/8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX> advanced 7/8 to 43 3/8 on 2.5 million shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical</ENAMEX> jumped 1 7/8 to 23 5/8.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMA Acquisition</ENAMEX>, an investor group that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pritzker</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX> had made arrangements for 23 other banks to provide $509 million in bank financing for the buy-out offer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> and six other banks, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, are providing the rest of the $1.6 billion.
Elsewhere on the takeover front, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> advanced 2 5/8 to 136 5/8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications</ENAMEX> tacked on 7/8 to 63 7/8. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Supreme Court</ENAMEX> affirmed a ruling that barred Chris-Craft Industries from voting its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> preferred stock as a separate class in deciding on the companies' proposed merger.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications</ENAMEX> climbed 1 1/4 to 58 1/2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> rose 1 1/2 to 64; both media companies have long been mentioned as potential acquisition candidates. Among other actual and rumored targets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth</ENAMEX> rose 1 1/4 to 60 1/2, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> went up 1 1/8 to 39 3/4, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armstrong World Industries</ENAMEX> gained 1 to 40 1/8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> rose 3/4 to 13 7/8.
In addition:
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soo Line</ENAMEX> jumped 2 3/4 to 20 1/4, above the $19.50 a share that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX> offered for the company in a takeover proposal.
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xtra</ENAMEX> gained 1 1/8 to 27 1/8. Investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Gintel</ENAMEX>, who owns a 4.7% stake in the company, said he plans a proxy fight for control of its board.
-- Golden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nugget</ENAMEX> rose 2 to 28 1/4. Its board approved the repurchase of as many as three million common shares, or about 17% of its shares outstanding.
Buying interest also resurfaced in the technology sector, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX>, whose board approved a $1 billion increase in its stock buy-back program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> rose 2 3/8 to 104 1/8 as 2.2 million shares changed hands.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer</ENAMEX> soared 4 5/8 to 111 1/8 on 1.8 million shares in response to the company's announcement of plans to introduce several products next month. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment</ENAMEX> gained 1 3/8 to 89 3/4 despite reporting earnings for the September quarter that were on the low end of expectations.
Among other technology issues, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cray Research</ENAMEX> rose 1 5/8 to 37, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> added 1 1/4 to 50 1/4, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandem Computers</ENAMEX> rallied 1 1/8 to 25 3/4, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data General</ENAMEX> rose 3/4 to 14 1/2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> gained 2 3/8 to 59 1/4.

Stocks of major toy makers rallied in the wake of strong third-quarter earnings reports. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mattel</ENAMEX> added 1 1/4 to 19 5/8, Tonka firmed 1 to 18 1/2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Galoob Toys</ENAMEX> rose 7/8 to 13 5/8 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasbro</ENAMEX> gained 1 to 21 7/8 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dun & Bradstreet</ENAMEX> lost 1 7/8 to 51 7/8 on 1.8 million shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> lowered its short-term rating on the stock and its estimate of 1990 earnings, citing a sales slowdown in the company's credit-rating business.
