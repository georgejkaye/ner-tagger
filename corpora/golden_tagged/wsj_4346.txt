Count on Wall Street to figure out a way to profit from the government's war on drug abuse.
``Crisis creates opportunity,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> strategist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward M. Kerschner</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> are likely to budget $8.8 billion for the anti-drug campaign in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, and that amount could expand in future years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> expects a number of companies to benefit. One is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermedics</ENAMEX>, a company with annual revenue of only $32 million. It makes a drug-sensing device called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sentor</ENAMEX> and another device to detect plastic explosives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber's Tina Rizopolous</ENAMEX> calls the stock a ``double play'' on ``two of the most virulent scourges of the 1990s: drugs and terrorism.''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> memo to clients says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sentor</ENAMEX> ``functions like a dog's nose except that it is 1,000 times more accurate and, in fact, is capable of detecting cocaine and heroin that are present in trace amounts.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James H. Morgan</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Investments</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, says he prefers to play Thermedics through the stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermo Electron</ENAMEX>, owner of 60% of its stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermedics</ENAMEX>, at 18 1/2 yesterday, ``is not cheap'' as it sells for more than 30 times the 60 cents a share Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> figures the company will earn in 1990. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermo Electron</ENAMEX> is trading at around 29 times the past 12 months' earnings, much less than Thermedics' 200 multiple.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compuchem</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syntex</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbott Laboratories</ENAMEX> are all on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s list because they are active in drug testing. Employers in government, sports and safety-sensitive industries such as airlines and railroads increasingly require pre-employment drug tests, and sometimes periodic tests during employment.
Of the three, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compuchem</ENAMEX> is the purest play -- that is, it derives the largest share of its revenue (about 50%) from drug testing. Its other major business is environmental testing for pollution-control efforts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compuchem</ENAMEX> is doing ``a good bit of testing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX>, and could have 20% to 30% {annual earnings} growth over the foreseeable future,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> says, but the stock ``has sort of been found'' by investors already. In the past year the shares have risen from a low of 5 1/2 to yesterday's 15 3/4. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> puts 1990 earnings at about 80 cents to 90 cents a share, so the stock is selling for about 18 times his estimate.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbott Laboratories</ENAMEX> gets only about $50 million in revenue from drug testing, a drop in its $6 billion bucket. But he says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbott</ENAMEX>'s equipment used in drug testing is ``one more reason to own a grand company'' that is ``in the forefront of anything that's medical.'' For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syntex</ENAMEX>, the diagnostics business's $154 million in revenue equals about 11 to 12% of sales, with drug-abuse testing accounting for half of that.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gail Cook</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perimeter Financial Group</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> financial planner, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syntex</ENAMEX> is also working on a nonaddictive pain reliever called ketorolac that hospitals could use in place of such drugs such as morphine. She says there are rumors that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> will approve the new drug soon after Christmas. The company says the drug would be ``primarily for post-surgical pain.'' It won't speculate on the timing of any possible FDA action.
Community Psychiatric Centers charges patients about $400 a day, scaring off all but the well-heeled and people with ample insurance. So it probably wouldn't benefit directly from increased government spending on drug treatment. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> thinks the chain of 44 psychiatric hospitals will benefit ``as corporations become more aggressive in identifying and treating addicts on their payrolls.''
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> says, defense companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E-Systems</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watkins-Johnson</ENAMEX> may get increased government contracts because ``electronic surveillance is playing a growing role in the drug war.'' And broadcasters such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC</ENAMEX> may find it easier to boost prices for commercials because ``advertisers displaced by anti-drug spots... will have fewer time periods to pick from.''
Demand for prison space may increase, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Craig</ENAMEX>, portfolio manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janus Fund</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>. Investors have recently bid up the shares of companies that operate prisons for various levels of government, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrections Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pricor</ENAMEX>. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX>'s fund owns neither. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrections Corp.</ENAMEX> has risen to 11 7/8 from 9 3/4 since President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s speech launching the drug war ``and it isn't even earning any money yet,'' he says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pricor</ENAMEX> has climbed to 10 1/2 from 8 1/2.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Parks</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parks Capital Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, thinks lots of people are noticing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrections Corp.</ENAMEX> but overlooking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wackenhut</ENAMEX>, which has a comparably sized corrections unit ``buried within it'' and sells for a more reasonable multiple.
The war on drugs could generate some investment losers, too. ``All that cash {taken in by drug dealers} goes somewhere. It does not get saved,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart Lawrence</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin E. Segal Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> consulting firm.
If the drug trade slows substantially, he expects declines in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> real estate, particularly luxury houses. There might be some effects on luxury car sales and sales of gold jewelry. Of course, any such analysis can be taken to extremes, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janus Fund</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX>: ``If you want to say people are going to drink more beer, that's up to you.
