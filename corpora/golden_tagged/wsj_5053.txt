U.S. uranium producers are being squeezed by an acute price depression in the international market, industry sources say.
But by the mid-1990s their prospects are expected to improve because the uranium price is expected to revive.
The free market price of uranium oxide, the mineral produced by the mines, has slumped to $9.60 a pound, the lowest level since 1974. Present quotes are now 78% below the 1978 peak of $43 a pound, an optimistic year that precipitated overproduction around the world.
``The uranium spot market accounts for only 10% of production,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Sellers</ENAMEX>, senior research officer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranium Institute</ENAMEX>, an organization representing producers and consumers of the mineral. ``But the price is used as an indication for contract negotiations,'' she says.
Prices have slid in the past few years because mining companies were unduly optimistic in the late 1970s and early 1980s and overestimated consumption, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranium Institute</ENAMEX>. As a result, uranium inventories in the market range between 140,000 and 180,000 tons, depending on the definition of stocks, it says.
``Large inventories overhanging the market have been a major uncertainty in the 1980s,'' the institute says.
The price decline has had such an impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> producers that their output fell to 5,190 metric tons last year from a peak of 16,800 tons in 1980, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranium Institute</ENAMEX> says. (A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.) World output has also fallen 18% to 36,420 metric tons in the same period, but the U.S. share has shrunk to 14% from 38% at its peak, according to the institute.
``Moreover, the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> producers is likely to worsen if prices remain depressed,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Clark</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranium Exchange Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, brokers and analysts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Resources Co.</ENAMEX>, for example, plans to shut down its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Taylor</ENAMEX> uranium mine near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.M.</ENAMEX>, by mid-October if it can not find an equity partner for the property, the company said.
The decision to close the operation by that date is based entirely on the current economics of the uranium market, the company said, even though it won the major share of U.S. supply contracts with Japanese utilities in the past year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Taylor</ENAMEX>'s reserves are 120 million pounds, but only about 45 million pounds of uranium can be extracted at a currently competitive price of about $15 to $20 a pound for long-term contracts, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuclear Fuel</ENAMEX>, an industry newsletter.
Other major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North American</ENAMEX> producers are also under pressure, industry sources say. They include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake Mining Co.</ENAMEX>'s uranium business, which incurred a loss of $1.2 million in the second quarter of 1989, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Algom Ltd.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rio Algom</ENAMEX>, however, said the company was ``making money because all its uranium production in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> was committed under long-term contracts signed when prices were higher.'' He added that uranium normally accounts for only about 25% to 30% of the company's income, which also comes from copper, potash, tin, and coal, as well as metals distribution.
At a conference of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranium Institute</ENAMEX> earlier this month, delegates were bitterly disappointed. They had hoped for an improvement in market conditions in the past two years, but the price has slumped despite many predictions of improvement.
Consumers had more than sufficient inventories and were putting pressure on producers, delegates said, so much so that it has paid some U.S. mines to buy or borrow uranium from other producers and consumers instead of mining it to fulfill contracts.
Yet, once again, uranium experts are forecasting a marked change in market conditions in the 1990s. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, they are likely to be correct, analysts say, but the eventual increase in price will now take place from a very low level.
Uranium demand is ultimately dependent on nuclear generating capacity and the institute, in a study, predicts that the capacity will grow 31% to 347,000 megawatts by the year 2005. World uranium demand in 2005 will rise to 54,000 tons from 37,000 tons this year, the institute says.
``This forecast is considered reliable because 92% of the units were either operating, under construction or firmly planned at the end of 1988,'' the institute says.
``A further upturn in orders for new nuclear plants could occur at any time due to the necessary replacement and expansion of electricity generating systems,'' the institute says.
Moreover, there are signs that the greenhouse effect will encourage nations to switch from coal-fired power stations to nuclear energy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Fischer</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranium Institute</ENAMEX>, says.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, the nuclear industry should experience renewed growth in all its sectors, particularly after the turn of the century,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uranium Institute</ENAMEX> says. Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
Copper
Production problems appear around the world almost as soon as previous ones are either solved or become so prolonged that they lose their influence on prices.
The latest is a rock fall at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Teniente</ENAMEX> mine, which produces 360,000 tons of refined copper a year. Production is expected to be delayed as long as 15 days. The news came just as the market was adjusting to the realization that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> strike in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> would drag on indefinitely.
This year has seen a succession of production disruptions: the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bougainville</ENAMEX> mine, which was shut down before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> and is still inoperative; the bankruptcy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cananea</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>; threatened or real strikes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>; never-ending difficulties in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zambia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zaire</ENAMEX>; and various other problems.
Demand for copper continues to be robust because the economy hasn't fallen on its face, as many expected. The price of copper for immediate shipment is commanding a widening premium over latermaturing futures. The September contract, which ceases trading Wednesday, last Tuesday rose to a life-of-contract high of $1.4050 after edging below $1 in early <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
The supply tightness has been more pronounced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> warehouses than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> inventories. The latter, in fact, are expected to rise about 10,000 tons in today's regular announcement and the premium on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> exchange of the spot contract over the three-month position is expected to continue narrowing.
Coffee
The focus this week will be on the start of the two-week meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> of the full 74-member Council of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Coffee Organization</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>, the world's second largest producer, will be in the spotlight as it tries to fulfill its usual role as the great mediator.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> has indicated it will propose the reinstatement of global export quotas of green coffee that were suspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgilio Barco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>'s president, is scheduled to meet with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> Friday to discuss the coffee and drug crises, which have become interrelated because of their economic impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>.
The principal obstacle to the reinstatement of coffee export quotas is the so-far unyielding attitudes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>, the major importing and exporting nations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants more flexible quotas that will increase the flow to market of more favorable mild coffees, and it also wants sales stopped of coffee at cheaper prices to nations that aren't in the agreement.
Any changes in quotas in favor of one group have to be at the expense of another, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>, which is always a huge target for such a move, is adamant in not giving up any of its 30% market share. In fact, it professes to be happy without export quotas. Neither are African and other Robusta-producing countries willing to surrender part of their markets to Central American nations, which would most benefit from flexible quotas.
There is less chance for agreement on a new pact than six months ago, because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> is taking a harder line than ever, one analyst observed.
Grains and Soybeans
Whether, and to what extent, an early frost spread across portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> over the weekend will be the determining factor weighing on futures prices this week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soybean</ENAMEX>, corn and wheat futures prices dropped in Friday's trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> partly in response to the lessening of frost predictions by some forecasters. But others are sticking with calls for frost as far south as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>, analysts said.
``This could end the growing season for all intents and purposes,'' said one analyst. Added another, ``Whatever happens, you can be sure we won't open unchanged'' in today's trading. Heavy spring rain delayed planting in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and as a result a killing frost could reduce the yield from less than fully mature crops.
