A Japanese retailer purchased a 10% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany & Co.</ENAMEX> and promised that it wouldn't buy more than 19.9% of the jewelry company's shares outstanding.
Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a Japanese department store group and principal distributor for Tiffany in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, will acquire 1.5 million Tiffany shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX> will hold about 13% of Tiffany after the transaction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Capital</ENAMEX>, the financial services unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>, will retain 750,000 shares. It acquired 2.25 million shares in connection with the purchase of Tiffany from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Products Inc.</ENAMEX> in 1984.
The original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> stake was subject to repurchase by Tiffany but this right was waived by Tiffany in order to permit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsukoshi</ENAMEX>'s purchase.
The transaction is expected to be completed by January, with about 500,000 shares changing hands at the end of this month.
Tiffany closed yesterday at $52.50, down 75 cents, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiffany</ENAMEX>, which operates nine stores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and a total of five in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, went public in May 1987. Its stock jumped $6.125 earlier this month on news that investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> received clearance to buy more than $15 million of the company's stock.
