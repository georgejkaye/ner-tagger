<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldus</ENAMEX>, a high-technology company whose earnings stalled in the second quarter because of excess inventory, said the program is the first to incorporate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OS</ENAMEX>\ software's advanced technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> is trying to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OS</ENAMEX>\ the industry standard for operating systems software, which controls a computer's basic functions. The product has yet to catch on well with users, however.
