<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF Trucks NV</ENAMEX> announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philippe Gras</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> managing director, said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bapilly</ENAMEX> plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX>'s British plant. The French state-controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gras</ENAMEX> said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months. The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX> are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs ($157.8 million) in the venture, including Ffr1 billion for design and development costs. In addition, the companies will each spend about Ffr1 billion on tooling up their plants.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gras</ENAMEX> said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX>, since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles. By pooling their resources, the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX> are aiming for a combined market share of about 11%.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX> will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks. Under a separate arrangement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace PLC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rover Group PLC</ENAMEX> subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX>'s truck-building subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renault</ENAMEX> Vehicles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Industriels</ENAMEX> will have similar rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX> is 16%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace</ENAMEX>, with a further 6.5% held by the Dutch state-owned chemical group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NV DSM</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Doorne</ENAMEX> family of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> holds an additional 11% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX>'s capital.
