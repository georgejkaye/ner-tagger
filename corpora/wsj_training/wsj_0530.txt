Since its founding in 1818, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX>, the standard-bearer of the Ivy League look, has eschewed flashy sales promotions and fashion trends -- the rules that most retailers live by. But with sales growth sluggish and other men's stores putting on the heat, the venerable retailer can no longer afford such a smug attitude.
So two weeks ago, thousands of Brooks Brothers charge customers -- customers conditioned to wait for twice-yearly clearance sales -- got a surprise: an invitation to come in and buy any one item for 25% off. During the four-day promotion, shoppers at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Short Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, store lined up to pay for big-ticket items like coats and suits.
That's not all. Departing from its newspaper ads featuring prim sketches of a suit or a coat, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> is marketing an updated image in a new campaign that carries the slogan, ``The Surprise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers.</ENAMEX>'' One color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied in a knot; another picture shows neckties with bold designs. The message is loud and clear: This is not your father's Brooks Brothers.
As part of its national ad pitch, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> will show less preppy women's clothes, moving away from its floppy-tie business stereotype. One ad shows a bright red jacket paired with a black leather skirt. And the ad copy is cheeky: ``How can you be a Wall Street hot shot without at least one Brooks Brothers suit in your portfolio?''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> hopes that shaking its time-honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise. ``We have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their {job} interview suit here,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Roberti</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX>. ``We want them to buy more of their wardrobe here.'' Industry watchers agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> is long overdue in updating its buttoned-down image, which has stunted its growth. When acquired in May 1988 by British retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks & Spencer PLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX>' annual operating profit was about $41.8 million on sales of $290.1 million. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberti</ENAMEX> concedes that since the $750 million takeover, ``sales growth hasn't been dramatic.'' For the 11 months ended March 31, operating profit at the 52-store chain totaled $40.5 million on sales of $286.8 million.
As Brooks Brothers jumps into the fashion fray, it will be playing catch up. Many clothiers, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX>, have cashed in on the recent popularity of updated Ivy League and English styles. In keeping with men's broader fashion scope today, businessmen are dabbling in English and Italian suits that are conservative but not stodgy. The rigid Ivy League customer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX>' bread and butter, meanwhile is becoming extinct. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Stuart</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barneys New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>.
``Brooks Brothers no longer has a lock on the {Ivy League} customer who is status-conscious about his clothes,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Davidson</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andover Shop</ENAMEX>, a traditional men's store in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>
By making a break from tradition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> is seeking a delicate balance. If it promotes fashion too much, the shop risks alienating its old-line customers; by emphasizing ``value,'' it risks watering down its high-minded mystique.
Fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant strides in its women's business, given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on the decline. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX>' aim is for 20% of total sales to come from the women's department, up from the current 12%.
``Everybody forgets that there are fashion cycles in classic merchandise,'' observes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Farmer</ENAMEX>, a retail consultant. ``For women, dressing for success in a real structured way is over.''
Despite these challenges, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks & Spencer</ENAMEX> sees big potential in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX>, noting the widely recognized name and global presence. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks & Spencer</ENAMEX> plans to open roughly 18 more U.S. stores in the next five years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> says business is robust at its 30 outlets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and two shops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks & Spencer</ENAMEX> is also considering opening stores across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> sometime in the future.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Smith</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marks & Spencer North America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX>, says that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX>' focus is to boost sales by broadening its merchandise assortment while keeping its ``traditional emphasis.'' The British parent is also streamlining: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX>, which continues to make almost all of its merchandise, recently shut one of its two shirt plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paterson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, and has closed boys' departments in all but 20 stores.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> is also remodeling its stores. Wednesday, it will unveil a $7 million refurbishing at its flagship store on Madison Avenue. With newly installed escalators, the store retains its signature wood-and-brass look but is less intimidating. More shirts and sweaters will be laid out on tables, instead of sitting behind glass cases, so that customers can ``walk up and touch them,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberti</ENAMEX> says.
Because the biggest growth in menswear is in casual sportswear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> is chasing more of that business. The entire second floor of its Madison Avenue store is now casual sportswear featuring items such as ski sweaters, leather backpacks and a $42 wool baseball hat with the store's crest.
The centerpiece of the overhaul, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberti</ENAMEX>, is the men's tailored clothing department, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Brothers</ENAMEX> has added new suit styles and fabrics. ``The perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberti</ENAMEX> says, referring to Brooks Brothers' signature three-button ``sack suit,'' with a center-vented jacket and boxy fit.
But it now offers more two-button versions and suits with a tapered fit. It also plans to add suits cut for athletic men with broader upper bodies. Next spring, nearly 30% of its suits will have pleated pants, compared with virtually none a couple of years ago.
Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberti</ENAMEX>: ``We want to turn the customer on.
