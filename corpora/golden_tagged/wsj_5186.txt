<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American General Corp.</ENAMEX> signed a definitive agreement to sell its group life and health insurance companies for $195 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Insurance Companies Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> financial services concern said that the sale of the group insurance operations will result in a third-quarter loss from discontinued operations of about $9 million, or 7 cents a share. When combined with a gain on the May sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American General</ENAMEX>'s property-liability insurance business, the company expects year-to-date net income from discontinued operations of $77 million, or 58 cents a share.
Both sales are part of a divestiture program that the company said it undertook because of its decision to market its services primarily through company-managed distribution systems. The divested businesses market their products through independent agents and brokers.
