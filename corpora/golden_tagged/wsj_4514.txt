Federal regulators set the level of capital that investors must inject into insolvent thrifts at 4.5% of assets, a level that should make it easier for many healthy thrifts to acquire their ailing brethren.
As recently as last week, officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX>, the agency created to sell and liquidate thrifts taken over by the government, had discussed setting the required capital infusion at 6% of assets. That prompted some worry in the thrift industry that the better-capitalized banking industry would have a stronger hand in buying up the government's inventory of sick thrifts.
``This will stimulate additional interest among thrifts,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kip Weissman</ENAMEX>, an attorney with Silver, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedman & Taff</ENAMEX> here. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weissman</ENAMEX> said there are many thrifts that can raise the 4.5% capital but would balk at trying to raise 6% because profits might not justify it.
Also, the assets on which the 4.5% level will be based will be adjusted for riskiness. Thus, broke institutions that hold less-risky loans, such as home mortgages, should be less expensive to acquire than thrifts that hold many commercial loans, which are considered riskier.
It's unclear, however, how the requirements for initial capital infusions will work with other capital standards for all thrifts that regulators are now working out. In a statement, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Wall</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> board member who is also the top thrift regulator, voted for the 4.5% level but indicated that a higher or even a lower capital rate may be needed to operate the thrift.
In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> said it moved the deadline for bids on five insolvent thrifts to Tuesday because of the announcement of the policy. The previous deadline had been yesterday. The thrifts are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University Federal Savings Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>; Freedom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Financial Savings Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">People</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Savings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Savings Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Mesa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christies International PLC</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aska International Co.</ENAMEX> owns 7.2% of the company.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based fine-arts auction house said the Japanese concern bought 11 million of its ordinary shares from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a company owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australian</ENAMEX> financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Holmes</ENAMEX> a Court. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carisbrook</ENAMEX>, which surfaced as a Christies shareholder last December, retains a small stake of ``significantly less than 1 million shares,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christies Finance</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Tyler</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aska</ENAMEX>'s emergence as a major Christies shareholder puzzled company officials. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christies</ENAMEX> had never heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aska</ENAMEX> but believes it might be a privately held company run by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasumichi Marushita</ENAMEX>, a Japanese art collector. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christies</ENAMEX> officials were trying yesterday to gather information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aska</ENAMEX> and its intentions toward the stake. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aska</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
``We hope it is a long-term investment,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyler</ENAMEX> said. ``We anticipate that is the case.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s shareholder-owned flag carrier, said talks are under way with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian Airlines Systems</ENAMEX> on a possible cooperation accord. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> spokesman, who declined to reveal details of the talks, said, ``It will be another agreement similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> agreement, but for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.'' In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Swissair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> announced an agreement to take a 5% stake in one another. That agreement built on a cooperation accord announced in March, in which the two airlines agreed to coordinate flight scheduling, marketing and other operational efforts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>, which is 50% owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>, has a 10% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> and is backing an investor group buying 53% of LAN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>.
Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot SA</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Calvet</ENAMEX> seemed to be winning a bitter wage dispute with striking workers in two plants, an item appeared in the satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchaine that could give the strike a second wind. The paper printed copies of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvet</ENAMEX>'s supposedly secret tax returns for the past three years, allowing all his employees to see that his salary was 2.22 billion francs last year (about $346,000) and that his raise was 24% in 1988. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot</ENAMEX> workers are striking because they want more than the 4.4% offered by the auto company.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet Communist Party</ENAMEX> rebuked two government ministers for failing to produce and deliver basic consumer goods, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pravda</ENAMEX> said. ``Out of 276 basic consumer goods, 243 can not be found in shops, including soap, toothpaste, razor blades, notebooks, pencils, clothing and shoes,'' the newspaper said. The two officials who were reprimanded, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pravda</ENAMEX> said, were the minister responsible for chemical and timber industries and the minister in charge of social development.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is underwriting a $25 million, three-month cultural festival to polish its image in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>. ``Europalia 89'' got under way this week and will include such features of Japanese culture as Sumo wrestling and No theater presentations staged throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is the first nation outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to be the focus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Europalia</ENAMEX>, a biennial event showcasing a single country that began 20 years ago. The aim of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, which is viewed by Europeans as a sometimes-aggressive trading partner, is ``to show ourselves from a better angle,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikie Kiyoi</ENAMEX>, first secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese Embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>.
Up to 46,000 highly qualified young people are leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX> every year to search for work.
``This is a very disturbing and distressing figure. The last time it was as high as that was in 1958,'' Communications Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Burke</ENAMEX> said when the latest emigration statistics were announced.
Figures for the past five years show that up to one in five people in the 15-to-24-year-old age group decided to emigrate to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. ``The equivalent of the population of Galway left the country last year and will continue to leave. I think it is absolutely shattering,'' said Roman Catholic Bishop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eamonn Casey</ENAMEX>.
Today's emigrants are computer-literate graduates -- the men and women who might have been <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>'s future architects, doctors, nurses and business executives. They are leaving a nation where almost 18% of the work force is unemployed -- one of the highest jobless rates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>.
Ironically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX> could prove to be the economic success story of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> in 1989, with analysts forecasting a 6% growth rate, record exports, a big boost for the crucial manufacturing industry and an excellent year for tourism.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sicilian</ENAMEX> muscatel is the best wine for use during the celebration of the Roman Catholic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX> The judgment was pronounced by a panel of priests and wine experts during a conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asti</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s Piedmont region.... <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> has banned nightclub patrons from throwing money at dancers and other entertainers. It says the custom humiliates the national currency.
