Gripped by sluggish exports, South Korea's current account in August ran a deficit of $136 million, the first trade gap since February 1986, when the deficit was $112 million, the Bank of Korea reported.
In August 1988, South Korea had a surplus of $816 million.
Bank officials said the current account for the first eight months of 1989 showed a surplus of $2.71 billion, down 66% from $7.9 billion for the same period last year.
They said it is unlikely South Korea will attain its year-end goal of an $8 billion surplus in view of dim prospects for a sharp pickup in exports for the rest of the year. The country posted a record current-account surplus of $14.16 billion last year.
South Korea's trade balance in August showed a deficit of $127 million on a balance of payments basis, compared with a $561 million surplus the previous year.
South Korean exports were listed at $5.17 billion in August, up 2.8% from a year ago while imports jumped 19% to $5.3 billion.
South Korea's sluggish exports since the start of this year have been blamed on a cumulative pinch from its currency's substantial appreciation since late 1987 as well as protracted labor unrest and steep wage boosts during the past two years.
Bank officials said South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. in August on a customs-clearance basis fell 51% to $375 million from the year-ago $768 million.
South Korean exports to the U.S. in August fell 6.7% from a year ago to $1.78 billion, while imports from its No. 1 trading partner rose 23% to $1.4 billion.
Officials said South Korea's trade deficit with Japan in August widened to $383 million from $345 million a year ago. South Korean exports to Japan in August increased 18% to $1.21 billion; imports from Japan rose 16% to $1.59 billion.
