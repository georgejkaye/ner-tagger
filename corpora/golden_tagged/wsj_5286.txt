(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KEISHI OGURA OF NEW JAPAN RADIO</ENAMEX> developed an improved electron tube in 1964 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> pioneer in microwave ovens, three years later had a product that has become a kitchen icon.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon</ENAMEX>, which used a 1939 British design to make radar equipment to detect enemy planes during World War II, had purchased a one-third interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Japan Radio</ENAMEX> in 1961 and made its tube designs available to the Japanese concern. In 1942, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon</ENAMEX> inventor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Percy L. Spencer</ENAMEX>, noted that a chocolate bar melted in his pocket while he was testing a radar tube. He then cut a hole in a kettle, inserted an electron tube and by 1949 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon</ENAMEX> patented its ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radarange.</ENAMEX>''
Designed for restaurants, the early 1953 models were oversized, cost about $3,000 and turned out bilious grey meat and limp french fries. They were duds for about a decade, remaining alien to many consumers. The Irish cook of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Adams</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon</ENAMEX>'s chairman who turned his kitchen into a proving ground, called the ovens ``black magic'' and quit.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogura</ENAMEX>'s simple electron tube made it possible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amana Refrigeration</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX> concern acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon</ENAMEX> in 1965, to make a practical, compact microwave oven that was introduced in 1967 at an affordable $495 for busy people seeking fast meals.
Some consumers were afraid of the early ovens. A 1968 scare, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walter Reed Hospital</ENAMEX> tested new ovens and found radiation leakage, led to federal standards in 1971.
Today, Asian companies are the dominant producers of the oven's working innards. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears Roebuck</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenmore</ENAMEX> is the largest U.S. market brand followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharp</ENAMEX> and by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric.</ENAMEX> Last year, nearly 11 million microwave ovens came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market, off from the record 12.6 million in 1987 but far above the 314,000 in 1972.
