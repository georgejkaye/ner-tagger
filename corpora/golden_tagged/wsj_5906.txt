Wall Street may be hot for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX>, but the flying public hasn't been so bullish lately on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> unit.
Throughout the summer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s service has been a disaster -- with about four out of ten of its flights arriving late or cancelled. The carrier recorded its worst on-time performance since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> started keeping track two years ago -- and has ranked consistently at or near last place among airlines.
The carrier's on-time arrivals of flights from 119 airports toppled to 63% in June from 74% in May. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the number dipped to 62%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> also accounted for almost half of the flights on what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> nickname the ``List of Shame:'' flights that arrive late at least 80% of the time. The average delay on the 60 United flights: 47 minutes and 42 seconds.
Things got so bad this summer that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> executives to find out what was wrong. ``They took a nose dive,'' says a department official. Last year during the same months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> recorded a respectable 81%.
Internal department analysis shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s biggest rival in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, trounced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s hourly on-time performance into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Hare Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s recent performance is even prompting jokes on late night television. Comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Leno</ENAMEX> fumed about a late flight. He wouldn't name the carrier, he said, but ``the passengers were real United'' in their anger.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s problems apparently have a combination of causes, including bad weather at some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> airports that it uses and its heavy reliance on Chicago <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Hare</ENAMEX>, where traffic often gets jammed up. But the biggest cause has been a slowdown by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United's</ENAMEX> pilots union in protest of management demands for contract concessions.
The pilots campaign, coined ``withdrawal of enthusiasm,'' involved, among other things, taxiing slowly for take-off, ordering elaborate maintenance checks between flights and flying with so much fuel that planes were slowed by their weight.
Under still another tactic, labeled ``Sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixteen</ENAMEX>,'' the pilots purposely arrived more than 15 minutes late; the point at which the transportation department marks a flight late in the monthly on-time statistics it releases to the public. Because of the time wasted by the delays, many pilots exhausted the monthly overtime they were allowed to work under government regulations.
Crew shortages began to crop up. A flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newark International Airport</ENAMEX> was stalled two hours because a pilot had to be flown in from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. The same week, a flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> managed to take off after a long delay only because an off-duty pilot, a ``dead head,'' in the passenger's section volunteered to join the cockpit crew.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment on the carrier's performance.
Things are likely to get better because the pilots are backing away from their campaign as they get closer to buying out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>. But the summer's problems may have done permanent damage in exhausting the loyalty of some flyers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Curtis</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> businessman, is peeved at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> because he was stranded for an hour on a plane that needed a light bulb replaced. Finally, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtis</ENAMEX> yanked out his cellular phone from his briefcase and booked a seat on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>.
``I grabbed my baggage from overhead, walked off the plane and retrieved my ticket,'' he fumes. ``I made my mile walk to American. Half an hour later, I was on an American flight leaving for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. That's survival in the air.''
Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtis</ENAMEX>: ``I decided if I want to get somewhere on time, I have to fly somebody else.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas G. Ford</ENAMEX>, a dentist from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, purposely avoided flying United on a trip last week to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> because he got fed up with its delays this summer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ford</ENAMEX> says that as he boarded United planes it wasn't unusual to see a mechanic crowded in the cockpit with the crew. He says, ``It's unnerving.''
The number of complaints filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> increased late this summer. The biggest gripe: flight problems such as delays and cancellations. Another sign of trouble is that some travel agents report that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> is doling out coupons to mollify disgruntled passengers.
``I've had a rush of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> vouchers in the last two weeks,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luci Alvarez</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Escape Travel</ENAMEX> in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> is also scoring poorly among seasoned travelers tracked by an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, newsletter that's being flooded with complaints. ``Overall, it's dismal,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ashington-Pickett</ENAMEX>, editor and publisher.
