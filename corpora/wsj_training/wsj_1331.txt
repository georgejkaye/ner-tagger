<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Part III</ENAMEX> is scheduled to begin today.
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Corp.</ENAMEX> and its vice chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James T. Sherwin</ENAMEX>, have changed considerably. The first two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations.
In an eight-count indictment, the government charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wayne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, chemical maker, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX> with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX> in advance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX>'s planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986.
The government's credibility in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> case depended heavily on its star witness, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd L. Jefferies</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Boesky</ENAMEX>, and then pointed the finger at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX>, takeover speculator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salim B. Lewis</ENAMEX> and corporate raider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Bilzerian</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferies</ENAMEX>'s performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX>'s bellwether role was short-lived. The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Johnson Lowe</ENAMEX> found that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document. After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked, and another mistrial was declared on March 22.
Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June. A month later, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jefferies</ENAMEX> was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government. In August, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to three felony counts.
Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> case. The mistrials have left the reputations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Heyman</ENAMEX> in limbo. For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX>, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> faces potential fines of $500,000 for each count.
Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September, defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial, but by the end of the month the talks had ended.
There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX>'s attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Liman</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX>'s counsel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Kaufman</ENAMEX>, will include testimony by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heyman</ENAMEX>. Neither testified at the previous trials.
For now, defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Gitter</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> defense attorney, said yesterday, ``As we go in for the third time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yogi Berra</ENAMEX>'s famous line is apt: `It's deja vu all over again.'''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DALKON SHIELD</ENAMEX> CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal.
Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.H. Robins Co.</ENAMEX>, which manufactured the device.
The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael A. Pretl</ENAMEX> and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan.
The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims. It also bars future suits against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robins company</ENAMEX> officials, members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robins</ENAMEX> family and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robins</ENAMEX>'s former insurer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Co.</ENAMEX> The latter provision is ``legally unprecedented,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan B. Morrison</ENAMEX>, a public interest lawyer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants.
More than 100,000 claims against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robins</ENAMEX> are pending. The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robins</ENAMEX> has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Bankruptcy Code since August 1985; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products Corp.</ENAMEX> wants to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robins</ENAMEX>, but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted.
In a brief filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> last week, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pretl</ENAMEX> criticizes the appeal for raising ``abstract'' and ``theoretical'' legal issues, while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6.
JURY `<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S CRIMINAL CONVICTION</ENAMEX> under Superfund law is a first.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles A. Donohoo</ENAMEX>, sole proprieter of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>, demolition company, was found guilty of violating the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Superfund</ENAMEX> law as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean Air</ENAMEX> Act.
Criminal convictions under the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superfund</ENAMEX> law are rare, and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case.
Under Superfund, those who owned, generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup, regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time.
Environmental lawyers say virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superfund</ENAMEX> also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment. In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donohoo</ENAMEX> was convicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX> late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing. He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building, a violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean Air</ENAMEX> Act.
The government sought a criminal penalty because ``no cleanup is possible here. Once {asbestos} is released into the environment, it can lodge anywhere,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A. Dennis</ENAMEX>, the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney who prosecuted the case. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donohoo</ENAMEX> is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11. His lawyer could not be reached for comment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donohoo</ENAMEX> faces as much as three years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $100,000 fine for the violation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clean Air</ENAMEX> Act.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TED BUNDY</ENAMEX>'S LAWYERS switch to victims' side in death-sentence case.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilmer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cutler & Pickering</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, law firm that spent over $1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Bundy</ENAMEX> -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX>.
The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Legal Foundation</ENAMEX>, a conservative legal group. The key issue in the case, which the law firm is handling without a fee, or pro bono, is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review.
The murderer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Gene Simmons</ENAMEX>, was convicted of killing 14 people. Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX>'s death sentence in a ``next friend'' capacity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilmer Cutler</ENAMEX>'s brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.J. Mode</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilmer Cutler</ENAMEX>'s managing partner, says the trial team that represented Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bundy</ENAMEX> was asked by the firm's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised.
The coupling of the law firm and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Legal Foundation</ENAMEX> is odd also, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilmer Cutler</ENAMEX> was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work.
``We give them a lot of credit for taking this case,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WLF</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Slobodin</ENAMEX>.
THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS: In federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvador Dali</ENAMEX> lithographs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Burke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Evans</ENAMEX>, formerly owners of the now-defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclay Gallery</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prudence Clark</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclay</ENAMEX> sales representative, were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dali</ENAMEX> artwork as signed, limited-edition lithographs. The posters were sold for $1,300 to $6,000, although the government says they had a value of only $53 to $200 apiece. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Pitman</ENAMEX>, the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney handling the case, said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclay</ENAMEX>'s total proceeds from the sales were $3.4 million. Attorneys for Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> and Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales, they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX>, who died in January. The posters were printed on paper pre-signed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dali</ENAMEX>, the attorneys said.
