<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North America Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grosse Pointe Shores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the U.S. luxury-car market expanding slightly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Krampe</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> sales arm of West German auto maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler Benz AG</ENAMEX>, predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes.
Most of the growth, he said, will come in the $35,000-to-$50,000 price range, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> has a 35% U.S. market share. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> sold 82,348 cars in 1988.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krampe</ENAMEX> also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> plans to bring out new models every year through the mid-1990s and it will shorten its product development cycle to eight years from 10 or 12 years to compete more effectively with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Lexus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s Infiniti and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s Acura luxury-car divisions.
