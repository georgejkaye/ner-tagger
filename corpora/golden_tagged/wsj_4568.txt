The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> took President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s chemical-weapons reduction plan a step further, offering to totally eliminate these weapons if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> agrees to do the same.
In a speech before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> yesterday, Soviet Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>, who welcomed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s initiative, proposed that the two nations ``radically reduce or completely destroy'' chemical-weapons stocks even before a treaty is agreed upon by 40 nations currently negotiating a chemical-weapons ban in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>.
But after the speech, a senior Soviet arms-control official, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Karpov</ENAMEX>, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> would insist the U.S. stop producing chemical weapons before it would sign such an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karpov</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> already has ceased such production. At a news briefing Monday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX> Adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would continue to modernize its chemical-weapons stocks until a multinational treaty is signed.
On Monday, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> offered to cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> stockpile 80% even before a multinational treaty is signed if the Soviets would reduce their stocks to an equal level. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also said that after a multinational treaty is signed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would cut 98% of its chemical-weapons stockpile within eight years if the Soviets sign the pact. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would eliminate the remaining stocks in the next two years if all nations capable of producing chemical weapons -- including those that aren't part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX> negotiations -- sign the total-ban treaty.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karpov</ENAMEX> criticized the last requirement, saying that the Bush proposal to eliminate all chemical weapons could be thwarted if one maverick nation refuses to sign the pact. The Soviet proposal apparently is based on the belief that once the two superpowers agree to a ban, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> could deal with any potential aggressor by using its vast arsenal of other weapons. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karpov</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> was ready to begin negotiations with the U.S. immediately, and that actions by the two nations would spur the negotiations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>.
In yesterday's speech to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. General Assembly</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> also proposed that all nuclear powers agree on measures to reduce the risk of war. Currently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> have such an agreement. The Soviet official mentioned several other arms-control proposals that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> has proposed before, including banning all nuclear testing and prohibiting the production of nuclear materials. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> in the past has rejected these proposals.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> pointed to the cooperative spirit of his meeting last weekend with Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, and said that by the time the two superpowers hold a summit by next summer, ``we may have passed the last turn on the road'' toward reaching an agreement reducing long-range nuclear missiles. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scowcroft</ENAMEX>, sounding slightly more optimistic, said last Sunday that such an agreement could be struck in time for the summit.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>'s speech was interrupted by applause only once, when he took an indirect poke at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> He said that while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> wasn't ``enthusiastic about the Polish communists' election setback,'' in which an East European communist government lost power in an election for the first time in more than 40 years, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> wasn't threatened by the development and was ``ready to cooperate'' with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>'s new government. Then he asked why other nations were so intolerant of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> and worried about the possibility of communist governments in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>.
