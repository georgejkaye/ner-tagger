Because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> in the winter of 1980 approximated life inside a vacuum cleaner bag inside a freezer, any diversion from the soot, dust, cold and static electricity therein was deeply appreciated, including the envelope I got one day from a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell</ENAMEX> librarian containing the jacket of a book entitled ``The Demands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>'' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James P. Sterba</ENAMEX>.
Since I had always wondered what librarians did at their conventions, this jacket seemed revealing. How cute, I wrote back: Some concessionaire makes up fake book jackets for you Dewey <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decimalists</ENAMEX> to send to friends. Not true, my friend replied. This is from a real book.
In the endless sea of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Smiths</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Joneses</ENAMEX>, the discovery of another name clone isn't news. But in the more circumscribed pond of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James P. Sterba</ENAMEX>, one is more startling. (After all, there are 46 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Smiths</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> phone book and only three <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sterbas</ENAMEX>, including a John and a Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>, so we aren't talking major-burden-to-the-planet here.)
In any case, as I studied the jacket I began to smell a rat because it described this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James P. Sterba</ENAMEX> as an assistant professor of philosophy at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Notre Dame</ENAMEX>. Two things didn't add up. First, as an undergraduate at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan State University</ENAMEX> (class of ``Kill, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bubba</ENAMEX>, Kill'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>), I learned early and often that any link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre Dame</ENAMEX> and philosophy was highly theoretical. (I mean, it was a freshmen exam question. Which fits best with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Notre Dame</ENAMEX>: 1. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meatheads.</ENAMEX> 2. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabies.</ENAMEX> 3. Second Place. 4. All of the above.) And I had personally witnessed drummers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MSU</ENAMEX> marching band sharpening their drumsticks in preparation for the self-defense required to survive a Saturday afternoon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Bend</ENAMEX>. It was said that our trombone players came away with teeth marks in their slides. This was the realm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knute</ENAMEX>, not Kant.
Second, the Sterbas of my acquaintance were fairly close to the soil. Sure, I had heard of one who made it big in the psychoanalytic dodge and another who knew a lot about fish, but most pursued honest careers in fields containing alfalfa or soy beans and if they worked indoors at all it was usually under the hood of a battered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> or a tired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allis-Chalmers</ENAMEX>. The idea of a Sterba having anything to do with philosophy was, quite simply, ludicrous.
Thus, with history and logic on my side, I airmailed an indignant missive to this obvious impostor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Bend</ENAMEX> imploring him to fess up. He didn't. Whoever this guy was, he was slippery. His reply came on a Notre Dame philosophy department letterhead. He identified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P.</ENAMEX> in his name as standing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX>, just as my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P.</ENAMEX> does, which made me more suspicious. He refused, moreover, to declare himself a philosopher, stating only that his paychecks came from the philosophy department. He wouldn't even say he was a teacher, stating instead, ``... if teaching presupposes learning then I certainly don't earn my living from teaching, for the message that I attempt to teach is that justice requires significant sacrifices from all of us, and judging from the behavior of too many of my students they are not getting the message.'' I didn't know why, but he also told me he wasn't Catholic. Now I see this as early evidence of the same ecumenical tolerance that might explain the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raghib Ismail</ENAMEX> in the Irish backfield.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anyway</ENAMEX>, I figured I'd pretty well nailed this so-called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sterba</ENAMEX> as a fraud. The following year, however, he counter-attacked, this time tracing his roots back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prague</ENAMEX> circa 1890. This was something only true Bohemians would know right off without a visit to a library, and I didn't think that was likely in his case because I had yet to hear or see any evidence of the existence of a library at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre Dame.</ENAMEX> Maybe this guy was for real.
Then, a few years ago, I ran into Father <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Hesburgh</ENAMEX>, president of the aforementioned institution, and introduced myself. ``What do you know,'' he said, ``we have a fine young philosopher back home named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Sterba</ENAMEX>.'' My case was weakening.
Finally, about two weeks ago, my phone rang and an earnest voice said, ``This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Sterba</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre Dame.</ENAMEX>'' He was extremely polite and confessed up front that this was a book-flogging call. Within days there arrived a 200-page paperback entitled, ``How to Make People Just: A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Practical Reconciliation of Alternative Conceptions of Justice'' (Rowman & Littlefield)</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James P. Sterba</ENAMEX>. He also included a 16-page curriculum vitae listing, among other things, the 10 other books he'd written in the last 10 years, his 87 articles and reviews in philosophical journals, including ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics of Nuclear Strategy</ENAMEX>,'' published just this year in Latvian translation in a publication called Proceedings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latvian Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philosophy</ENAMEX>, as well as the fact that he's been a full professor since 1985. As resumes go, this one had heavy-hitter written all over it.
In the book itself, Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sterba</ENAMEX> discusses the conceptions of justice (moral not legal) of libertarians, socialists, welfare liberals, feminists and what he calls communitarians (sort of conservative let-the-locals-decide types) and argues... well, I don't want to spoil things by revealing the ending for would-be readers. But I must say that it probably was not his smartest move, marketing-wise, to begin his introduction this way: ``It is generally recognized that in today's society, academic philosophers have little impact on moral and political decision-making.'' Still, I thought it was an interesting book. While no ``From Here to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eternity</ENAMEX>,'' it does contain a chapter entitled, ``From <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairness</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Androgyny.</ENAMEX>''
I should declare right here that the idea of journeying to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Bend</ENAMEX> last Saturday to meet in person such a distinguished and nimble intellect as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James P. Sterba</ENAMEX> was purely that of my editor. It is true that in my phone conversation with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sterba</ENAMEX> it quickly became apparent just what a fine and decent fellow he is. But this had absolutely nothing to do with the part of our talk that veered into the subject of football and my discovery that this renowned academician had extra tickets to the long soldout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre Dame-Michigan State</ENAMEX> game.
Alas, Saturday demonstrated just how sorely the world needs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sterba</ENAMEX>'s guidance in the justice realm. Hurricane Hugo was long gone, the sky showed sun and blue, and I was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laguardia</ENAMEX> in plenty of time to catch Usair flight 1477 to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton</ENAMEX> for a connection to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Bend</ENAMEX>. About 45 minutes after the flight was supposed to leave, a gate attendent announced that we had everything necessary for its commencement -- airplane, fuel, flight attendents and passengers -- except pilots. The flight was cancelled, the game lost, and the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James P. Sterba</ENAMEX> the younger (he was born 48 days after me) could not be empirically confirmed.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sterba</ENAMEX> is a senior writer for the Journal.
