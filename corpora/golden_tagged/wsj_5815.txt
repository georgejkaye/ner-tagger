<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> will take a 4.9% ownership stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> for $120 million and purchase control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers' CIT Group Inc.</ENAMEX> for $1.28 billion, in the biggest U.S. investment to date by a Japanese bank.
However, it doesn't appear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>, long regarded as the sleeping giant of Japanese banks, will be boosting its stake in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> anytime soon.
The stakes to be held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>, the world's largest bank, were announced as part of a sweeping recapitalization plan unveiled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> that includes a $950 million addition to loan-loss reserves and an equity issue of as much as $500 million before the end of the year. Manufacturers has about 51 million shares outstanding.
The purchases by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>, which means ``the first'' in Japanese, eclipse prior business investments by Japanese financial institutions, specifically Bank of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Chartered Bank PLC</ENAMEX> for about $750 million in late 1988.
The reserve addition will result in a $775 million third-quarter loss for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> and a projected $475 million loss for the year. In the year's first six months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX>' net income was $209 million, or $3.70 a share.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s seventh-largest banking company took the steps to neutralize investor worries about its huge portfolio of loans to developing countries and comparatively weak capital base. The addition to loan-loss reserves will boost that account to $2.4 billion or 36% of the bank's medium-term and long-term loan exposure; the reserve had stood at 22%, the lowest among major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> banks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Mcgillicuddy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> chairman, said he would ``prefer not to do'' the reserve addition and added that he would not be selling the stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> ``except for the fact that capital today is the name of the game.''
Asked if the actions will put the developing-country debt question behind it, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgillicuddy</ENAMEX> said, ``I sure hope so.''
The move is bound to put pressure on other major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> banks to boost reserves before year end. In recent months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Corp.</ENAMEX> have boosted reserves above 30%. British banks, which unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> banks have tax incentives to make reserve additions, have boosted the developing-country debt coverage to 50% of their exposures.
Securities analysts were encouraged by the actions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James J. Mcdermott Jr.</ENAMEX>, research director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keefe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bruyette & Woods</ENAMEX>, said: ``In June they figured that they had a black hole of $1.8 billion in capital needs. This gets them $1.5 billion. This is a new company. It will slim them down and give them focus.'' He added that ``I think you'll see a shift in analysts' sentiment'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers.</ENAMEX>
The announcement came just prior to yesterday's market close. In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> closed at $41.75, up 87.5 cents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>, which had $410.59 billion in assets as of March 31, will pay $120 million, or about $45 a share, for its 2.7 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> shares and has agreed not to purchase additional shares for 10 years without the bank's consent. The price is slightly above yesterday's closing price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuko Oana</ENAMEX>, senior managing director for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s international operations, said the two banks have had ``a warm relationship for over 40 years.''
Manufacturers will report a gain of about $100 million on the sale of its 60% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX>, which it bought in 1984 for $1.51 billion from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA Corp.</ENAMEX> Since the purchase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> has had to completely overhaul the once-troubled asset-based lending company, selling its consumer-finance unit last year and refocusing its business on larger ticket items, such as aircraft.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgillicuddy</ENAMEX> said proceeds from the $1.28 billion sale will be used to pay down Manufacturers debt, adding that the bank's cost of amortizing the premium it paid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> will be reduced. As a result Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgillicuddy</ENAMEX> said the CIT sale will have practically no impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX>' earnings and will unlock $850 million of value in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CIT</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert R. Gamper Jr.</ENAMEX> will remain chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gamper</ENAMEX> said the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> will no longer be a wholly owned subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> to get more deeply into the leasing business than it can under current banking laws.
Once the sales are completed and the new equity raised, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> will have about $3.1 billion in tangible equity, $61 billion in assets and a developing country loan exposure of about $6.7 billion. As of June 30, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> had $1.8 billion in tangible equity and $74 billion in assets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toshiichi Hashimoto</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> branch, said the bank considers the leasing business particularly important and noted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CIT</ENAMEX> investment ``gives us access to the leasing business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S</ENAMEX>''. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hashimoto</ENAMEX> also said the stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> would assist the bank's merger and acquisition effort in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> That's because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CIT</ENAMEX> could have many small and medium-sized clients that would make potential acquisition targets for some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s large Japanese corporate customers.
Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> has five branches in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. The bank has also been an active lender to U.S. takeovers and leverage buy-outs, including that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> Analysts estimate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s U.S. assets are around $25 billion to $30 billion.
While it is the biggest bank in terms of assets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> has lagged its Japanese competitors in entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> is playing catch-up. The bank is the product of a 1971 merger of two Japanese banks that didn't go smoothly. The problem of fusing the two staffs, analysts and competitors contend, forced the bank to concentrate more than it otherwise might have on its domestic business. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> grappled with its internal problems, its biggest competitors made significant inroads into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market.
Several large Japanese commercial banks already have extensive investments in the U.S.: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Tokyo Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanwa Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumitomo Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> all have sizable branch operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> where Japanese banks account for roughly 20% of the banking business.
In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanwa</ENAMEX> all control primary dealers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government securities, an elite group of institutions that deals with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> when it buys and sells securities as part of its open-market operations. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumitomo Bank</ENAMEX> a few years ago paid $500 million for a 12.5% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, a leading Wall Street firm.
Overall, Japanese institutions hold about 9% to 10% of all U.S. banking assets. Moreover, Japanese financial institutions have announced or completed several large deals within the past year.
Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> agreed to acquire the U.S. commercial banking operations of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank PLC</ENAMEX> for about $200 million.
Last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orix Corp.</ENAMEX>, a major leasing company, agreed to pay $190 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Alliance Corp. of First Interstate Bancorp</ENAMEX>, a company involved in financing capital equipment. In June, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orix</ENAMEX> paid about $80 million for a third of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodities Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>-based money manager.
In June, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> agreed to pay $100 million for a 5% stake in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> finance unit that includes leasing, commercial and consumer finance and venture capital. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> also has an option to purchase another 5% interest later.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> isn't the first Japanese bank to buy an asset-based lender to U.S. medium-sized companies. In 1984, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> paid $425 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heller International Corp.</ENAMEX> But since then, the big Japanese bank has been forced to pump in hundreds of millions of dollars more, in a series of capital infusions and purchases of Heller problem loans, that has boosted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX>'s total investment in the company to $1.25 billion.
But one analyst predicted that by keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CIT</ENAMEX> as a partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> could well avoid a similar fate. ``What they are doing is getting firmly into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market, particularly the middle market,'' he said.
Like most Japanese banks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> doesn't worry much about the Third World debt that has so burdened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> and other U.S. banks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s capital and assets are so huge and its Third World lending exposure so relatively small that the consequences of such nonperforming loans are negligible.
