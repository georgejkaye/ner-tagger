<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comerica Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> have agreed to a lower price for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comerica</ENAMEX>'s purchase of Alliance.
The new price is $48.28 a share, down 22 cents from the $48.50 a share specified in the purchase agreement announced last February. The adjustment in the price reflects a higher cost of cleaning up hazardous materials on a parcel of property owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance's</ENAMEX> chief subsidiary.
The new price would give the deal a value of about $53.1 million. Alliance has about 1.1 million shares outstanding.
