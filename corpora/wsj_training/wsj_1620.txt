<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley-Davidson Inc.</ENAMEX> filed suit in federal court here, alleging that a group that holds 6.2% of its stock made ``false, deceptive and misleading'' statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX>'s complaint claims that the group, led by investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm I. Glazer</ENAMEX>, violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15% of the company's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made, it didn't disclose the group's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazer</ENAMEX> couldn't immediately be reached to comment. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harley</ENAMEX> last week publicly questioned the legality of the group's filing procedures, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, investor said ``we complied with every law,'' and he denied any wrongdoing.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glazer group</ENAMEX> said in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harley-Davidson</ENAMEX>, or seek representation on the company's board. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harley</ENAMEX> has said it doesn't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party.
