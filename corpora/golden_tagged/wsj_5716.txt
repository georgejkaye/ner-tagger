In early June, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> stole away from the Capitol in his chauffeured <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> for a secret meeting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> with his old buddy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>.
The two had been commiserating quietly for weeks about a common problem: how to achieve steep deficit-reduction goals without violating the president's no-tax-increase pledge. And this time, they hit upon a solution that only a politician can fully appreciate. They decided to try to reduce a tax in order to raise revenue.
``I'll try to put together a bill that won't attract a veto,'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> promised the president. They then went on to talk about capital gains.
So began the bizarre saga that led last week to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX>'s approval -- over Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX>'s opposition -- of a controversial cut in the capital-gains-tax rate. It's a story of how the president flattered and feted the burly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> Democrat into taking his side. Then, after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> switched and opposed the tax cut -- he now calls it ``a financial disaster for this country'' -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> got his way anyway.
In between, the usually shrewd <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> pol acted like a puppy dog to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, weakening when his pride and vanity were stroked by the president. At one stage, the chairman even embraced as his own a capital-gains scheme that was shaped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> budget director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX>.
The consequences of Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX>'s miscalculations are enormous. His loss of control will have a lasting effect on him and possibly on the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> speaker, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, who has put his prestige on the line to defeat the capital-gains cut. The future of relations between the Democratic-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the Republican <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> also is at stake. Even after clearing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX>, the proposed tax reduction faces a number of hurdles on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> floor. And in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> opposes it. Still, the odds now appear better than 50-50 that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will enact some kind of reduction -- a move that was all but unthinkable just a few months ago.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> vote is a major victory for President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, who has made the cut a priority. And it is proof of the power wielded by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Jenkins</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, the conservative Democrat who put together the unshakable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means coalition</ENAMEX> in favor of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s idea. Both men advocate the tax change as a boon to the economy and an important investment incentive.
Opponents, though, see it as a boon to the rich with no proven benefits to the economy. They also say it's the first step toward unraveling the massive tax overhaul completed just three years ago.
``Cutting capital gains is a knife at the heart of tax reform,'' laments Democratic Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, a father of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Reform</ENAMEX> Act of 1986. Adds Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Budget Committee</ENAMEX>: ``We're facing the danger of repeating the 1981 fiasco, when we lost control of both budget and tax policy.''
Back at the start of the year, there was no greater opponent of cutting the capital-gains tax than Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX>. ``It's a tax break for the wealthy that will significantly increase the deficit,'' he said then. ``I can't imagine any member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> willing to take such a step.''
The chairman's negative reaction was fully in step with his fellow Democrats. At the same time, though, he was also concerned about fast-approaching budget deadlines that raised the issue of how to increase revenues to help reduce the deficit. And that concern brought him round again to the issue of capital gains. The reason: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paradoxically</ENAMEX>, capital-gains cuts stimulate so many asset sales initially that in the short run federal revenues actually increase.
There was another issue involved as well, of a far more-personal nature. The chairman never tires of bragging that he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> are old friends; they served together on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was a congressman in the 1960s, and have kept in contact ever since. Just before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> delivered his inaugural address last January, he acknowledged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> -- to the chairman's delight -- with a ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny</ENAMEX>'' audible to the entire nation.
During later talks with the chairman, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> helped his cause by pushing all the right buttons. At one meeting, the chairman invited the president to attend both a lunch and a dinner on the same day to honor the 200th anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX>, a celebration of immense importance to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX>.
At first, the president resisted attending both affairs. But Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> continued to insist. ``You're going to both of them '' the chairman recalls saying with a smile. And, in a grand gesture, the president agreed.
But the chairman's fondness for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> got him into deep trouble. Soon after he went public with his new-found interest in capital gains, he closeted himself in a room on the second floor of the Capitol to hear what the Democratic majority on his committee had to say. It wasn't pretty.
From every corner of the cramped room, he was berated by his usual allies. They complained that capital gains was a tax break for the rich that Democrats had no business in promoting. They said it would distort the economy. ``Democrats should not be undoing tax reform,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Matsui</ENAMEX> declared, his voice rising. Some even suggested that the chairman was playing footsy with the president to his own party's detriment.
In the midst of the protests, a lone voice rose in favor of the capital-gains cut. ``I don't want anyone to be under the misapprehension that capital gains won't be offered,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX>, the soft-spoken Georgian.
Faced with the depth of feeling at the meeting, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> publicly backed away from the capital-gains tax cut. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> had unleashed the possibility of such a cut, and it wouldn't just disappear. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX> quietly began building a pro-cut coalition, carefully consulting administration officials as he crafted his plan. The chairman didn't interfere, and although he denies it, some say he gave the Georgian his tacit support. Some lawmakers who were fighting for some tax changes that would cost money were told by those close to the chairman to speak to Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the committee met its basic revenue requirements for deficit cutting, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> made a plea to stop there. But a slew of popular, soon-to-expire tax breaks still needed funding, raising again the issue of how to increase revenues -- and adding steam to the capital-gains-cut effort.
As Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX> gained backers, worried Democratic leaders counterattacked. Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gephardt</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> privately emphasized their opposition, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> persuaded a few wavering lawmakers, including Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Guarini</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, to toe the party line.
But President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was busy too, begging support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenkins</ENAMEX> plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX> put together a bare committee majority made up of six Democrats and all 13 Republicans. When Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> appealed to one of this number, Democratic Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.J. Pickle</ENAMEX>, the crusty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texan</ENAMEX> told him the request was ``like waiting outside the delivery room and having your mother say,'Son, you ought not to have kissed that girl.'''
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> argued that the tax cut was ill-timed, warning Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> that it would sour relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. To the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenkins</ENAMEX> Democrats, he predicted that a gains-tax cut would be part of a bigger tax bill next year that would also include a higher top tax rate for the wealthiest Americans.
Dealing now with a weak hand, Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> hastily suggested an alternative plan: indexing capital gains to inflation. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> was deputized to take the idea to the administration in hopes of working out a compromise. His conversations with budget chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> tax experts led to two possible compromise plans, both of them based on the notion of rewarding those who hold assets a long time by giving them a bonus tax break based on the sales price. The idea won over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenkins</ENAMEX> forces but it alienated the rest of the Democrats, who regarded it as all but indistinguishable from a rate cut. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> had no choice but to stand aside while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX> prevailed.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> insists he has no regrets about how things turned out. His goal, he says, hasn't ever been the elusive one of ``tax purity'' but of getting things done and writing new law. ``I still view myself as the compromiser,'' he says. ``Some shots make people happy, and some make people sad.''
