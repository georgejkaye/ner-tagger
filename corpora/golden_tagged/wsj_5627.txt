The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Labor Committee</ENAMEX> approved a measure that raises the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour over two years and that sets a 60-day subminimum training wage for employees with less than two month's working experience.
Last June, the president vetoed a bill that would have increased the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour over three years and set a 60-day subminimum training wage for first-time workers.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has insisted he will veto legislation that sets the wage floor higher than $4.25 an hour over three years. He also says the measure must permit new employees in minimum-wage jobs to be paid a training wage for six months. The Democratic sponsors of the new measure say they compromised by limiting the increase to $4.25, but that they refuse to compromise further on the training wage.
In a statement yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> reiterated Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s promise to veto any bill that raises the minimum wage to more than $4.25 an hour in less than three years or that establishes a training wage for less than six months.
The bill approved yesterday by voice vote would increase the minimum wage by 45 cents in January 1990 and another 45 cents in January 1991. The minimum wage has been $3.35 an hour since 1981.
The full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> is expected to consider the measure within two weeks. Although the bill is expected to pass, congressional aides say it's uncertain whether it will attract the two-thirds vote needed to override a veto. In August, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Labor Committee</ENAMEX> passed the same bill the president vetoed last June, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Democrats are expected to modify the measure when it's considered on the floor.
