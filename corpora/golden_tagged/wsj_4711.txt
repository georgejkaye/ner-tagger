<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> violated the constitutional right to free speech when it tried to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, city council to allow a private Catholic university to discriminate against homosexual students, a federal appeals court has ruled.
The case arose from a suit brought by two gay-student groups against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgetown University</ENAMEX>, in which the groups sought to compel the school to grant them official recognition and certain campus privileges. A lower court held that a local human-rights statute barred <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgetown</ENAMEX> from discriminating on the basis of sexual preference.
In response, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> last year passed a law making federal funds appropriated for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> contingent on the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX>'s adopting a measure that protected religious organizations' right to discriminate against gays.
The city council sued the U.S. in federal district court, attacking the constitutionality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s action. In a unanimous opinion, a three-judge panel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Court of Appeals</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> Circuit upheld the district court's ruling that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> violated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> members' right to free speech by compelling the local legislators to approve a particular bill.
The appeals-court panel, in an opinion written by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Edwards</ENAMEX>, ruled that legislators' votes ``constitute'speech' protected by the First Amendment.'' Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX> cited long-standing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> precedent that the ``manifest function of the First Amendment in a representative government requires that legislators be given the widest latitude to express their views on issues of policy.''
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> intervened, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgetown</ENAMEX> had agreed to allow the gay-student groups access to university facilities and services, although the school said it wouldn't formally ``recognize'' or otherwise endorse the groups.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> will hear arguments Monday in a related case considered to be one of the most important civil-rights disputes pending before the high court. The Court will review the constitutionality of a lower court's contempt citation against city council members in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yonkers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, who refused to comply with a court order directing them to build public housing as a remedy for past acts of racial discrimination.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATE HIGH COURT</ENAMEX> upholds use of DNA fingerprinting in a criminal case for the first time.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruled unanimously Friday that DNA evidence was admissible in two capital cases against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy W. Spencer</ENAMEX>, known as the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Side Strangler</ENAMEX>,'' who has been convicted and sentenced to death for four rapes and murders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>. It was the first time a state's highest court ruled that DNA fingerprinting was admissible in a criminal case.
The judges ruled that ``no dissent whatsoever {exists} in the scientific community'' concerning the reliability of the DNA printing technique. Blood samples from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer</ENAMEX> were genetically matched with semen found at the scene of two of the murders.
The ruling contradicts a finding by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bronx Supreme Court</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Sheindlin</ENAMEX> last month in the murder trial of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Castro</ENAMEX>. Following an exhaustive hearing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trial judge found that DNA evidence of a genetic match linking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> to a double murder was unreliable. Scientists from the testing company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifecodes Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valhalla</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, recanted their prosecution testimony and testified for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castro</ENAMEX>, saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifecodes</ENAMEX>' testing procedures and its results were flawed.
Lifecodes performed the DNA tests in all four of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer</ENAMEX>'s cases, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer</ENAMEX>'s lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey L. Everhart</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, said the company didn't use the same procedures as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> case. He said he will appeal the death cases to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everhart</ENAMEX> said he was unable to find any expert witnesses to testify against the accuracy of genetic fingerprinting.
THE TRIAL of the former president of Beech-Nut <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutrition Corp.</ENAMEX> ended in a mistrial.
A federal jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niels L. Hoyvald</ENAMEX>, who was charged with selling apple-flavored sugar water labeled as pure apple juice for babies.
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Platt</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. District Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, set Nov. 6 as a new trial date. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Roche</ENAMEX>, executive assistant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern District</ENAMEX>, said the jury was deadlocked at 10-to-2 and then at 9-to-3 for convicting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoyvald</ENAMEX> in the mail-fraud and conspiracy case. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoyvald</ENAMEX> was convicted in February 1988 of 351 counts of willfully violating federal food and drug laws. That conviction was overturned in March on technical grounds.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoyvald</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. The company, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestle S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, didn't have any comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROSECUTORS WON'T</ENAMEX>  SEEK a new indictment against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> by the Oct. 1 deadline.
But Assistant U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John K. Carroll</ENAMEX>, who is leading the prosecution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>'s former chief of junk-bond operations, said the delay in the expanded indictment will be ``weeks, not months.'' The deadline was set by prosecutors at a hearing last month.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX> disclosed the change of plans at a hearing held yesterday before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimba Wood</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX> was charged last March in a 98-count indictment alleging that he had committed racketeering and fraud. Also indicted were Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>'s brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowell Milken</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Lee Newberg</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> junk-bond trader.
Other current and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> employees likely to be charged in the new indictment include, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Trepp</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> trader, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Gardiner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Rosenthal</ENAMEX>, former traders, according to individuals familiar with the investigation.
Also at the hearing, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>'s lawyers challenged an attempt to subpoena his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> bills from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX> for 1983 through 1987.
Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX> has postponed a ruling on the matter, pending a written explanation from prosecutors for why they are seeking the bills.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LISA ANN JONES</ENAMEX> will remain free on bail pending the appeal of her perjury conviction despite objections of federal prosecutors. In federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard B. Sand</ENAMEX> rejected the government's request that bail not be granted. The judge ruled that the 26-year-old former trading assistant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> can remain free on a $100,000 personal recognizance bond. The government argued that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>'s appeal of the March conviction raised no substantial questions that could change the trial's outcome. Last month, she was sentenced to 18 months in jail and fined $50,000 for lying to a grand jury looking into allegedly illegal stock trades.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">PAUL A. BILZERIAN</ENAMEX>'S  request for a new trial has been denied by a federal judge on the eve of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singer Co.</ENAMEX> chairman's sentencing. U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Ward</ENAMEX> rejected Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>'s arguments for a new trial and said the court correctly ruled that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX> could be questioned about advice from his lawyers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bilzerian</ENAMEX>, who was convicted in June on nine felony counts related to his takeover activities, is scheduled to be sentenced this morning by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ward</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
