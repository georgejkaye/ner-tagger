<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunbelt Nursery Group Inc.</ENAMEX> said it is offering to purchase shares from stockholders who own fewer than 100.
The nursery retailer said it will pay $6 a share or the average closing stock price between Sept. 15 and Oct. 30, whichever is higher. Each shareholder also will receive $15 for selling the stock to the company.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunbelt</ENAMEX> spokesman said that about 2,000 to 2,500 of its stockholders own fewer than 100 shares, most of which probably were received when the company was spun off from Pier 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imports Inc.</ENAMEX> in 1985. The company has about 3.8 million shares outstanding.
