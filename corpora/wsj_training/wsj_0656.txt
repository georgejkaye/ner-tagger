<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Petrie</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrie Stores Corp.</ENAMEX>, said he has agreed to sell his 15.2% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb Shops Corp.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrie Stores</ENAMEX>.
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filing, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petrie</ENAMEX> said that on Oct. 26 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrie Stores</ENAMEX> agreed to purchase Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petrie</ENAMEX>'s 2,331,100 Deb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shops</ENAMEX> shares. The transaction will take place tomorrow.
The filing said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrie Stores</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Secaucus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, is purchasing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Petrie</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb Shops</ENAMEX> stake as an investment. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrie Stores</ENAMEX> has considered seeking to acquire the remaining equity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb Stores</ENAMEX>, it has no current intention to pursue such a possibility, the filing said.
