<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel Holding Corp.</ENAMEX>, after two years of on-and-off moves to take over the thrift, said it is throwing in the towel.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel C. Mccarver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>'s executive vice president, said the company wasn't interested any longer because the recent passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act</ENAMEX> had substantially boosted the capital requirements of the combined concerns.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Nelms</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal Savings</ENAMEX>, which has $3.3 billion in assets, said that ``regardless of this action by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal</ENAMEX> will continue to pursue its restructuring.''
The battle to take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Van Nuys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, thrift began when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> acquired options in 1987 for a 32% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX> later announced a hostile $18.50-a-share bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal</ENAMEX>, which was rejected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal</ENAMEX> board. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citadel</ENAMEX>'s options have expired, and it doesn't hold any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal</ENAMEX> stock, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said.
