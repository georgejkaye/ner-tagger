Your Sept. 13 page-one article ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generic-Drug</ENAMEX> Scandal at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> Is Linked to Deregulation Drive'' says, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s current problems are a legacy of the Reagan administration's push to deregulate.'' This turns the story precisely on its head. Unlike most ventures in red-tape cutting, the deregulation of generic drugs was pushed by congressional Democrats and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Nader</ENAMEX> groups and actively resisted by the Reagan administration.
The facts are simply related. Wider and speedier access to generic drugs has long been a goal of liberal reformers, who have hoped consumers would switch from the higher-priced offerings of the ``research'' drug companies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> administration launched an ambitious program to deregulate generics, but this move was fought bitterly by the research companies, which argued that it was unfair to wave generics through the gate when they themselves had been forced to spend millions of dollars on testing to get the same compounds approved earlier. In its final days, the Carter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> gave the go-ahead to the deregulation program.
The incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reagan Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> secretary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Schweiker</ENAMEX>, promptly yanked the deregulation program for reconsideration. He came under ferocious attack, however, from Democratic Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Gore Jr.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>, who charged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schweiker</ENAMEX> with fronting for the research drug companies. Two months later, amid every sign of reluctance, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schweiker</ENAMEX> bowed to the congressional pressure and let the deregulation go through. (A full account is in the May\ 1981 issue of the magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulation.</ENAMEX>) Five years later, congressional Democrats pushed through another round of decontrol, again without signs of great enthusiasm from the Reagan people.
And now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Wolfe</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Citizen Health Research Group</ENAMEX> led the fight to deregulate generics, turns around and tells the Journal that the scandal can be blamed on the Reagan crew's ``atmosphere of lawlessness'' and insufficiently adversary stance toward generic makers. He is counting on the shortness of your readers' memories.
The irony is that the position from which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfe</ENAMEX> is now running away with such celerity is actually quite a respectable one. That FDA employees can obtain bribes from generic applicants through their power to sit on applications for years suggests that the problem is not too much deregulation but too little. Whatever balance should be struck between consumers' interest in getting old drugs cheaply and their interest in seeing new drugs invented, it can be struck through patent policy rather than by forcing generic makers to jump through needless paper-work hoops. That was true when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Waxman</ENAMEX> proclaimed it, and it is still true now.
