<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> settled extensive fraud charges made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General's Office</ENAMEX>, agreeing to pay restitution, fines and other penalties that may eventually total $100 million.
The settlement is one of the biggest ever in a consumer fraud case.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer</ENAMEX> is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Corp.</ENAMEX>, a multinational giant with interests including communications, information and financial services, manufacturing and hotels.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General's Office</ENAMEX> filed a lawsuit alleging that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> defrauded thousands of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> consumers by mailing them letters and certificates promising pre-approved credit, inducing them to take out loans that sometimes carried rates as high as 35% and then illegally charging them for insurance, club memberships and other services that the customers didn't request and frequently had no idea they were receiving.
Though the loans were small -- usually between $500 and $2,000 -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> said at least 100,000 people were affected.
``They blanket the state with these direct-mail promises of easy money,'' he said. ``I get them all the time. I got one just the other day.'' He said most of the victims of the alleged scam were poor people who were easy prey. ``These are people who are often desperate,'' he said. ``They're borrowing money for food for their children.''
The settlement, worked out over the past eight months, was filed yesterday at the same time as the suit. In it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer</ENAMEX> acknowledged no guilt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton W. Schober</ENAMEX>, an attorney for the unit, said it isn't denying the charges, either. He asserted that the company didn't suspect anything was amiss at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> operations and didn't know about the attorney general's investigation until January.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas E. Wilshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer</ENAMEX>'s president, said in a written statement that the alleged violations ``without doubt, were contraventions to our procedures and not a pattern of behavior condoned by the company.''
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer</ENAMEX> has a history of similar practices and alleged wrongdoing. Since 1984, six states have filed enforcement actions or lawsuits charging fraud. At least two class-action suits have been brought against the company on behalf of consumers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer</ENAMEX> has entered consent decrees or been the subject of cease-and-desist orders in all six of the states. It has paid more than $2.7 million as a result of the cases.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer</ENAMEX>, one of the largest consumer finance companies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, had $4.8 billion of loans outstanding as of Dec. 31.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> scoffed at the statement that the company had no reason to suspect anything might be wrong at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> operations until January. He said that state investigators had swarmed over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer</ENAMEX>'s offices in June 1987, photocopying loan documents. ``I think that was a pretty good hint,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> and several other investigators suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> settlement could trigger a flood of investigations and lawsuits by other states. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Consumer</ENAMEX> operates in 34 states. ``The attorneys general around the country have been made aware of some of these practices and will note this settlement with interest,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van de Kamp</ENAMEX> said.
The settlement covers allegedly fraudulent transactions dating to January 1985. It calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> Consumer to pay a civil penalty of $8,670,000. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT</ENAMEX> unit also agreed to provide $10.5 million that will be used to bolster <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s consumer-protection efforts and beef up fraud detection.
