up to his elbows in blood -- that just seems irresistible to television. From ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Hospital</ENAMEX>'' to ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus Welby</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M.D</ENAMEX>''. to ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Elsewhere</ENAMEX>,'' doctors (like cops) have become the perennials of the small screen.
This season, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> brings us ``Island Son'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuesdays</ENAMEX>, 10 p.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ET</ENAMEX>), grafting the ever-successful doctor formula on the no less popular exotic-Hawaiian-locale formula (``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Magnum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">P.I.</ENAMEX>,'' etc.). The result is the story of a sensitive, caring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.D.</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kamehameha Hospital</ENAMEX>.
The real raison d'etre for ``Island Son'' is to be a star vehicle for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Chamberlain</ENAMEX>, to bring the veteran TV actor back to a one-hour dramatic series. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlain</ENAMEX> certainly knows his way around a hospital. Although he reached mega-stardom as the king of the mini-series (``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shogun</ENAMEX>,'' ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorn Birds</ENAMEX>,'' ``Wallenberg''), he first came to fame playing young Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kildare</ENAMEX>, perhaps the most dashing thing ever in a white coat.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Kulani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M.D.</ENAMEX>, in ``Island Son,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlain</ENAMEX> is looking somewhat the worse for wear, but with that handsome profile he's probably still going to raise some pulses as he makes his rounds. So maybe he's a little past his prime to be considered a heartthrob -- just think of him as a cardiac infarction.
There's no question he's a doctor. Within the opening minute of the premiere episode, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlain</ENAMEX> leaps out of his convertible at the scene of a car crash and announces, ``I'm a doctor.'' By the second minute, he's giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. And in case anyone missed the point, by the third minute, he's administering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CPR</ENAMEX> and doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">M.D.</ENAMEX>-speak: ``No spontaneous pulse, no respiration... we have ventricular fibrillation ''
But this is not just any doctor -- Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kulani</ENAMEX> is idealistic, dedicated and warmhearted. And soon enough, he's got a dilemma to torture himself with. It turns out that the little girl he saved with the heavy breathing (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX>) is actually brain dead, and he must ask the mother for the child's heart so he can transplant it into a needy seven-year-old boy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Kochola</ENAMEX>. But how can he ask the mother to pull the plug on her daughter, when the little girl is all she has?
Confused, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kulani</ENAMEX> goes back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tutu</ENAMEX>, his adoptive parents, for their advice -- some of that native folk wisdom: ``The decision is difficult,'' he is told. ``Listen to the voice inside, my son.''
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel</ENAMEX> agonizes, Tutu gardens. ``Your mother sometimes feels the spirit of her mother in the rush of the warm wind,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tutu</ENAMEX> says. ``You mean the  daughter will live through the boy?'' exclaims Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>, catching on. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tutu</ENAMEX> digs his spade into the earth. ``Out of one plant, so many others will be born,'' he says. ``It's a good feeling to make things grow.''
And just when you think ``Island Son'' is going to break the ``Kung <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fu</ENAMEX>'' record for fortune-cookie philosophy, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX> leaps on a horse and rides off along the beach, stopping only to gaze up at a bird soaring free on the wind.
Finally, he makes a decision, and returns to talk with the mother. Staring deep into her eyes, he tells her the little girl won't make it. But wait, he says, ``When you see a bird flying in the sky, and then you no longer see the bird, the bird is still flying -- somewhere out there it's still flying -- it's not gone.'' Not surprisingly, the mother breaks into tears at this bit of stupefyingly bad dialogue.
In the end, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX>'s mother consents, the operation happens, and the closing shot shows her at little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby</ENAMEX>'s bedside, giving him <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice</ENAMEX>'s favorite stuffed dog.
I guess the point of this exercise is to jerk some tears, but rarely have I seen anything so wooden. The plot is predictable, the words are second-rate, and the acting is mediocre.
To be fair, I guess I should mention that the episode also had several subplots, including a crusty old man with an adorable pooch, and a brash young doctor at odds with the establishment. Leaving no cliche unturned, the series also proposes a beautiful love interest for Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kulani</ENAMEX>.
Only in one area does ``Island Son'' offer some surprises -- with its decision to portray the actual culture of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. Unlike ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Magnum</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">P.I.</ENAMEX>,'' or even ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> Five-O,'' in which locale was more or less secondary, little Hawaiian tidbits are sprinkled throughout ``Island Son,'' from the pidgin (``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howzit</ENAMEX>, bruddah?'') to the food to the spirit of the place (where ``haole,'' white, is the ultimate insult). Although much of this, like the mystical mumbo-jumbo, doesn't work, and much feels as out of place as a hula in an operating theater, the local color is the one genuine element of ``Island Son.'' The producers should do all they can to work with it and expand it, because -- make no mistake -- this show needs intensive care.
There's a scene midway through the hour in which the little boy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby</ENAMEX>, asks Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan</ENAMEX>, ``If your name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kulani</ENAMEX>, how come you aren't Hawaiian?'' ``It's a long story,'' says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kulani</ENAMEX>. ``Want to hear it?'' ``No, thanks,'' says little Bobby. Only seven years old, and already he's smarter than all the executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>.
