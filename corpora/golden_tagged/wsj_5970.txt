The federal appeals court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> will decide whether obtaining inside information through a breach of confidence among family members constitutes insider trading.
The ruling, which would be the first on the issue by a federal appeals court, is expected to help define the scope of insider trading, a murky area of securities law. Defining insider trading is especially difficult when the investor isn't a corporate insider but has simply heard the information by accident.
In the case, information was inadvertently leaked through a chain of communications within a family. The case involves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chestman</ENAMEX>, a former broker and vice president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gruntal & Co.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX> was convicted in March on 30 counts of securities and mail fraud and one count of perjury in relation to the 1986 sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldbaum Inc.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co.</ENAMEX> He was sentenced to two years in prison and to pay approximately $250,000 in restitution to people who sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldbaum</ENAMEX> stock on Nov. 26, 1986.
The government's star witness was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Loeb</ENAMEX>, the nephew by marriage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldbaum</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Waldbaum</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> testified that he passed material nonpublic information to his broker, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX>, before the public announcement of the $50-a-share sale to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&P.</ENAMEX> The government said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX> then bought 11,000 Waldbaum shares for himself, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> and other clients.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> learned of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&P</ENAMEX>'s takeover plans through a family grapevine initiated by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waldbaum</ENAMEX>. During the trial it was disclosed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waldbaum</ENAMEX> told his sister to gather her shares in anticipation of the sale. The sister was an older woman in frail health who asked her daughter to give her a lift to the bank to pick up the stock certificates. The daughter, in turn, asked her sister -- who was married to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> -- to pick up her children from school so she could take their mother to the bank. That sister told her husband about the plans, and he passed them on to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX>. No member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waldbaum</ENAMEX> family was accused of wrongdoing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elkan Abramowitz</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> lawyer representing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX>, said his isn't an insider-trading case because ``the information came from a non-insider, a distant relative of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Waldbaum</ENAMEX> who did not get the information in a corporate capacity.'' The appeals court will hear arguments the week of Oct. 9.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Pitt</ENAMEX>, an insider-trading expert and a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fried</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, said a critical point is the reliability of the source of information. If someone acts on information overheard in a conversation between people who aren't identified, there is no wrongdoing, he said.
However ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chestman</ENAMEX> knew that the information emanated from the family who owned the business. That it was reliable, and that he acted on it, is critical here,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pitt</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JIM BEAM</ENAMEX> SUES its insurer over legal fees in fetal-alcohol suit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim Beam Brands Co.</ENAMEX> won a key legal victory in May when a jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> ruled the company couldn't be held liable for a child's birth defects. The child's parents claimed the company failed to warn consumers of the risks of drinking alcoholic beverages during pregnancy.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deerfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, distiller is back in court, claiming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Indemnity Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, balked at reimbursing Beam for legal fees incurred during that successful defense.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chadbourne & Parke</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stafford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooper & Stewart</ENAMEX>, which both represented <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beam</ENAMEX>, were selected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX>' consent, the complaint said.
According to the complaint, filed last week in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Travelers</ENAMEX> encouraged the distiller to ``defend the litigation with particular and thorough diligence in light of the novel issues involved.'' Beam says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX> was breaching its insurance contract by refusing to pay the legal fees.
The fetal-alcohol case was viewed as having national significance. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beam</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Brands Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, had lost, lawyers said, many other such cases might have been filed against liquor companies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Tribou</ENAMEX>, second vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX>, said he couldn't comment on the suit because he hadn't seen the papers. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers</ENAMEX> already paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beam</ENAMEX> in excess of $500,000 for legal fees and had ``strong legal and factual reasons'' for not paying the additional fees in dispute.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tribou</ENAMEX> said continuing discussions were held with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> over the disputed fees, which he said totaled several million dollars.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSLIC</ENAMEX> SEEKS criminal restitution in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunrise Savings</ENAMEX> case.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> asked a federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> to order two former officers of the defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunrise Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX> to repay $2.9 million in ``misapplied funds.''
The two are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert C. Jacoby</ENAMEX> -- former chairman, president and chief executive officer of the thrift -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Skubal</ENAMEX>, who was vice president of the savings and loan's mortgage unit. They were recently convicted on various charges, including fraud and misapplication of funds, in connection with real-estate loans to developers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sentencing</ENAMEX>, which had been scheduled for last week, has been set for Oct.
In recent years, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSLIC</ENAMEX> has become increasingly aggressive in seeking restitution in criminal cases involving wrongdoing in the thrift industry. Although prosecutors concede the chance of collecting much money is slim, they say they are under considerable pressure from the Bush administration to make the effort. ``There are going to be a lot of these cases coming up,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Feinstein</ENAMEX>, special counsel for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Bank Board</ENAMEX>, which oversees the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSLIC</ENAMEX>. In October, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FSLIC</ENAMEX> will come under the jurisdiction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX>
In the Sunrise case, the amount being sought includes $1.3 million, the price of a 26-carat diamond ring purchased by a real-estate developer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacoby</ENAMEX> was convicted of misallocating the thrift's funds by letting the developer cover the purchase with a construction loan.
Lawyers for Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacoby</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skubal</ENAMEX> say they will fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FSLIC</ENAMEX>, arguing that neither man received any of the money in question.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW JERSEY</ENAMEX>'S HIGHEST COURT will be a defendant in a suit by two lawyers.
Filed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Guralnick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel Wayne Gerber</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Laurel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, the suit challenges the state's system of arbitrating fee disputes between lawyers and clients rather than letting such conflicts go to court.
The arbitration panels, comprising both lawyers and lay people, are arms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Jersey Supreme Court</ENAMEX>. Their mission is to hear both sides and then come up with a fair -- and binding -- settlement.
The lawyers say the system is unconstitutional because it deprives them of a right to a trial before a jury in such fee disputes.
The federal suit names the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> high court, an arbitration panel and a former client in a divorce case who the lawyers claim still owes them $1,000.
``I feel entitled to have the same redress in court that other citizens have,' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guralnick</ENAMEX>.
JURY REJECTS religious  defense to sex-for-hire charges.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles City</ENAMEX> Attorney's office accused the leaders of the Church of the Most High Goddess of running a brothel, the defendants countered that the sexual practices in question were an integral part of their religion.
High Priest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Tracy</ENAMEX> and High Priestess <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Ellen Tracy</ENAMEX> said at their trial last month that rites for would-be members include sexual relations with Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracy</ENAMEX>, as well as donations to the church. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tracys</ENAMEX>' lawyers argued that to construe the rites as prostitution would deny the Tracys their First Amendment right to practice religion according to their beliefs, regardless of how unconventional the beliefs may be.
``The question became whether they honestly were practicing their beliefs or using the beliefs as a front for illegal activities,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonni Hoffman</ENAMEX>, deputy city attorney.
Rendering their decision earlier this month, the jury rejected the defense and convicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Priest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Priestess</ENAMEX>.
But, with the help of First Amendment advocates who took up their cause, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tracys</ENAMEX> are planning to appeal.
