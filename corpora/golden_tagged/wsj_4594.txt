An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> judge ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Blair</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enfield Corp.</ENAMEX>, improperly declared himself elected as a director at the company's annual meeting. The judge appointed the nominee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enfield</ENAMEX>'s largest shareholder to the board in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>'s place.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Supreme Court</ENAMEX> Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Holland</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> ``chose to act as judge in his own cause'' when he disallowed ballots cast by representatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Express Ltd.</ENAMEX> at the June 20 meeting. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>'s actions at the meeting were ``in accord with a plan conceived... to protect his personal interests.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX>, which has a 38.5% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enfield</ENAMEX>, nominated Timothy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hees International Bancorp Ltd.</ENAMEX>, as a director and cast the votes it held in his favor. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>, ruling that proxies held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX> officials were void, declared himself elected.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX>, a holding company, is a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hees</ENAMEX>, another holding company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> financiers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Bronfman</ENAMEX> with investments in consumer products, resources and financial services. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enfield</ENAMEX> is a manufacturing concern.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> has been under a restraining order preventing him from acting as a director since shortly after the annual meeting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enfield</ENAMEX>'s board is preparing a management circular for a second shareholders' meeting called for Oct. 31 to elect new directors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manfred Walt</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enfield</ENAMEX> board may or may not nominate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> as a director. He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX> will probably issue its own circular, which won't nominate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> said he is ``disappointed but not surprised'' by the court ruling. He had argued that the ballots weren't in accord with the proxies held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Express</ENAMEX>, making them invalid.
