<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Group Inc.</ENAMEX>'s recent agreement to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aspen Airways Inc.</ENAMEX> is at first glance puzzling: Why would a company involved in cement making, newsprint recycling and fast-food hamburgers buy a regional airline?
But the move is characteristic for former entertainment magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Sugarman</ENAMEX>, who holds about 31.8% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX>, who is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Group</ENAMEX>'s chairman, has always had a propensity for overseeing an eclectic mix of businesses. And this most recent acquisition simply makes it a new hodgepodge.
Meanwhile, a new emphasis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> may be emerging. Last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> said it would study the feasibility of building a major recycled newsprint mill that could triple the output of its current facility in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pomona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> A glut of old newspapers across the country mean that raw material for this business is cheap and plentiful; if demand for recycled newsprint from newspaper publishers improves, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> could be expanding at the right time.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> acquired the newsprint operation earlier this year from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media General Inc.</ENAMEX> as part of a settlement resulting from a hostile takeover attempt. It didn't seem like a good fit for a company, which also held a big stake in an entertainment concern, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>, best known for ``The Gong Show.''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX>'s core business in cement making in fact had been involved in resource recovery for years by burning waste materials to fuel its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> plants. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> has made noises about selling the cement operation since 1987.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> has said that his businesses relate to each other because they are all low-cost operations in some sense geared to a mass market, whether game shows, the 22%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rally</ENAMEX>'s fast-food chain or even cement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> sold its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris</ENAMEX> earlier this year, severing its ties with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> production company, makers of ``Rain Man'' and ``Batman.'' But the 50-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> got his start producing television specials, went on to produce such movies as ``Children of a Lesser God,'' and has never indicated he's finished with the entertainment business.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached to comment.
