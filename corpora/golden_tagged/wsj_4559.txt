Your Sept. 1 advertising column on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, inc. missed the point of its stagnation. Too bad you didn't ask a few readers.
When this magazine started, it was the best. It was a delight to read, full of exciting, interesting articles, wit, humor, fancy, verve and originality. It reflected the vitality and dynamism that we like to think that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> has. The editor then was a woman who was subsequently fired.
Then the publication became stodgy, full of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PR</ENAMEX>, press-release puffery, given to adoring adulation of the richissimos. Its articles were often stupid, silly and boring. I am sure that I am not alone in wondering at the management that destroyed a talented staff.
