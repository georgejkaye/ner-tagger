<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> said it applied to Taiwanese securities officials for permission to open brokerage offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX>'s application is the first since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> announced June 21 that it would allow foreign brokerage firms to do business in that country. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> officials are expected to review the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> application later this year.
Under current rules, investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> can buy overseas stocks only through the purchase of mutual funds issued by local and foreign investment trusts. The new rules will allow investors to buy foreign stocks directly.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> said the brokerage service will be directed at individual investors who want to buy foreign and domestic stocks. ``It's an attractive market with good growth opportunities,'' he added.
