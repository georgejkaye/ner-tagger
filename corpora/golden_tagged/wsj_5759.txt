<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> said it and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optical Radiation Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Azusa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, have developed a process by which a digital optical sound track can be printed directly onto motion picture film.
As a result, movie theatergoers will be able to listen to higher quality sound than that currently available, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard D. Wood</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optical Radiation Corp.</ENAMEX> ``It will be like switching from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LP</ENAMEX>'s to compact disks.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> said the joint venture is currently in discussion with movie producers to make the first feature film utilizing the new technology. Although some additional equipment will be required by the theaters, the new process will add no new costs to film producers, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joerg Agin</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s motion picture and audiovisual products division.
Unlike current films which have magnetic strips to record analog sound, the Cinema Digital Sound process will allow film negatives to be encoded with a digital sound track, providing digital disk sound quality to movies.
