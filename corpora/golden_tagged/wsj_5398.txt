Striking workers halted production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot S.A.</ENAMEX> auto plant yesterday as management and union activists appeared to harden their positions in the two-week pay dispute against the French auto maker.
Between 600 and 800 strikers blocked access roads to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot</ENAMEX>'s plant at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mulhouse</ENAMEX> in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> with barricades and burning tires, witnesses said, preventing nonstrikers from going to work.
The assembly lines were shut down because ``they are missing workers,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot</ENAMEX> spokesman said. The plant employs 12,000 workers.
Four unions representing metalworkers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mulhouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot</ENAMEX>'s plant in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sochaux</ENAMEX> went on strike Sept. 5 to force the company into negotiations over a pay plan to take effect Oct. 1.
