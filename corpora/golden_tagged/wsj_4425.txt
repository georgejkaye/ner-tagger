Citing his right against self-incrimination, a former top official of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> refused to answer questions before a House subcommittee probing influence-peddling at the housing agency.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Wilson</ENAMEX>, who was executive assistant to former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce</ENAMEX> during the early 1980s, accused the panel of prejudging him. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> made the same accusation Tuesday when he refused to testify before the subcommittee and invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination.
Despite Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s refusal to answer questions, the panel managed to get new details about his business dealings after he left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. Without the knowledge or approval of his current employer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, the subcommittee was told, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> earned hefty fees as an outside consultant on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> projects. He also helped win lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> business for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>.
``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> appears to have been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lantos</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Marron</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> chairman, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Treadway</ENAMEX>, an executive vice president, testified that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> had denied doing outside consulting work while he served as a $325,000-a-year vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> during an internal investigation conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> firm. That investigation disclosed no improprieties on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s part, according to the two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> executives. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> has been on administrative leave with pay since late August.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Naclerio</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> official who now is a builder and housing consultant, testified that he paid Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> $15,000 for consulting work on two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> projects while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s payroll. According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naclerio</ENAMEX>, on one project Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was paid $10,000 simply for making a phone call to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter Cushing</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> official who Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Naclerio</ENAMEX> said initially opposed the project for political reasons. On another project, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> received $5,000 for contacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> about a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX> housing project backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delio Rojo</ENAMEX>, a major contributor to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>'s 1980 presidential campaign.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marron</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treadway</ENAMEX> were also confronted with documents indicating that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> had authorized an $80 million underwriting for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> project sponsored by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> developer with whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> had a business partnership.
Conceding that the company's internal investigation had been incomplete, the two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> executives said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s consulting activities and his authorization of the underwriting appeared to violate the firm's internal guidelines on business conduct. However, it was unclear what, if any, actions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> will take against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treadway</ENAMEX> said the company's own investigation had found that some of the more than $10,000 Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> billed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> as expenses for entertaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials appeared to be personal. The company hasn't yet asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> to reimburse it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s treatment of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> since his name surfaced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal has been cautious. ``We didn't want to be arbitrary and dismiss him and then get hit with a lawsuit,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treadway</ENAMEX> explained.
The differential between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> salaries provided one of the few light moments yesterday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaws</ENAMEX> dropped when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Treadway</ENAMEX> told the lawmakers, who earn $89,500, that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s $325,000 salary last year ranked him only 560th at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>. ``You'll have lots of applications before these hearings are over,'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> predicted.
