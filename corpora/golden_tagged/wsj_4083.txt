Their faces are lined, their hair silver, their voices often quavering. They are, for the most part, the old men of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> -- the remnant of a parliament that hasn't been able to hold an election since 1972.
Their gathering at a Saudi mountain resort is considered by many Lebanese to be the last hope for their country's tattered democracy to prevail over the arguments of guns and shells. ``Failure,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein al-Husseini</ENAMEX>, speaker of the Lebanese parliament, ``will lead to hell for us.''
Yet the hope that the meeting will bring much-needed political reform is as frail as many of the aged delegates. Two days of talks in closed session have produced little of substance, with disagreements over the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syrian</ENAMEX> forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> threatening to create an impassable barrier to progress.
The meeting comes after months of mediation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Fahd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Morocco</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Hassan</ENAMEX> and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chadli Bendjedid</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algeria</ENAMEX>, who agreed to tackle the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> problem at a summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Casablanca</ENAMEX> last May. Hosting the meeting is an uncharacteristic gesture by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudis</ENAMEX>, who generally conduct their most daring diplomacy well behind the scenes. Lately though, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Fahd</ENAMEX> has shown an increasing willingness to bluntly articulate the kingdom's position, talking tough to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> as well as taking the lead on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>.
It is ironic that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lebanese</ENAMEX>, who once boasted the Arab world's most vibrant democracy, now must seek the sanctuary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, an absolute monarchy. But attempts last year to convene parliament in Beirut were unsuccessful, with intimidation by various factions' militias preventing the formation of a quorum of two-thirds of the members.
This meeting is being attended by representatives of all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>'s factions. Deaths have left 26 of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>'s 99 parliamentary seats vacant, but 63 of the 73 surviving members arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taif</ENAMEX> after a ceasefire Sept. 23 allowed Beirut's airport to open. The arrival of all but 10 members, many of whom are too ill to travel, is cause for optimism, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saud al-Faisal</ENAMEX>, the Saudi foreign minister and a key figure in convening the meeting. ``The number indicates the general mood and feeling of all the Lebanese that this is the time to move forward,'' he says.
Already there have been passionate exhanges over the issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX>. But the debate hasn't followed strictly sectarian lines. According to one observer, one of the sharpest exhanges followed a Sunni Moslem parliamentarian's bitter attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syrians</ENAMEX>, saying that even he, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanese</ENAMEX> parliamentarian, wasn't free to go to his home town without Syrian say-so. But others, including some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christians</ENAMEX>, who generally oppose the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syrian</ENAMEX> presence, have warned of chaos and violence that could follow a premature Syrian pullout if rival militias were left free to seize the streets.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> have offered the parliamentarians a draft document of national accord, which suggests limiting the power of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christian Maronite</ENAMEX> presidency, a post that has been vacant since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amin Gemayel</ENAMEX>'s term expired last year. It also proposes evening the parliamentary balance between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moslems</ENAMEX>, and suggests that a new Lebanese government be able to call for Syrian withdrawal after two years. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Aoun</ENAMEX>, the Christian leader, wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syrians</ENAMEX> out before political reform.
While the Saudi foreign minister says the kingdom's role is merely to facilitate the delegates' deliberations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> are well able to fuel any agreement. While it isn't as flush with cash to bankroll Arab behavior as it was during the height of the oil boom, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> still can wield much leverage both with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syrians</ENAMEX> and with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iraqis</ENAMEX>, who back Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aoun</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syrian</ENAMEX> economy is tottering, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> ran up big debts to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> states during its long war with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>.
``The decision is yours,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Fahd</ENAMEX> said in a message read to the opening session by the foreign minister. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lebanese</ENAMEX> will be the winners if you come to agreement.
