<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Telephone</ENAMEX> unit requested $880 million in rate increases as well as pricing flexibility and greater opportunities to raise profits, which have plummeted under ``incentive'' regulations.
Analysts said the proposal, if adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Public Service Commission</ENAMEX>, could help to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nynex</ENAMEX>'s lackluster earnings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Telephone</ENAMEX> is proposing to nearly double basic monthly rates for residential service and to increase business rates about 25%, between 1991 and 1995, by eliminating subsidies, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hopley</ENAMEX>, the company's managing director of pricing and costing. He said the company could try to woo its business customers by reducing rates for regional long-distance, Centrex switchboard and data-transmission services.
The proposal would allow for a net revenue increase of 2% to 3% a year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hopley</ENAMEX> said.
Analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert B. Morris III</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> said the proposal could help reverse the earnings slide at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Telephone</ENAMEX>, which contributes two-thirds of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex</ENAMEX>'s profits.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> said he has downgraded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex</ENAMEX>'s 1989 earnings projections to $6.10 a share, from an estimate made in January of $6.65, and 1990 projections to $6.65 a share, from $7.05. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex</ENAMEX> earned $1.3 billion, or $6.63 a share, on revenue of $12.7 billion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Bonomo</ENAMEX> declined to comment on earnings.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris</ENAMEX> said the proposed plan would provide ``an opportunity -- not a guarantee. The company still has to perform.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Public Service</ENAMEX> Commisioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eli M. Noam</ENAMEX> said it's too early to say whether a rate increase is justified. He said the commission hopes to act by December on the company's request for an initial $359 million rate increase, effective Jan. 1, and for a new regulatory plan, effective in 1991.
A majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> commissioners doesn't have ``as strong an aversion to rate increases as in some states. We understand the need for new investment in the network,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noam</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Telephone</ENAMEX> said its overall rate of return has dropped to a projected 9% this year -- far below the 14% rate authorized -- despite new regulations in 1988 providing incentives to earn higher profit.
The incentive plan hasn't worked, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hopley</ENAMEX> said. A slow economy and stiff price competition have hurt revenue, and the plan freezes basic telephone rates until 1991, he said.
However, analysts said the company's slow progress in cutting costs and boosting labor productivity was also a factor in its failure to meet profit projections.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Telephone</ENAMEX> Comptroller <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Flaherty</ENAMEX> disagreed. He said the company achieved all cost-cutting goals, including a $100 million reduction in labor expenses.
The proposed initial rate increase of $359 million is to be applied toward replacing $367 million of inside wire. An additional increase of $520 million is requested for 1991 so that the company can achieve a 14% rate of return and can begin eliminating subsidies on basic service.
Under the plan, basic residential rates, currently $15.63 a month, would increase to an estimated $20 in 1991 and $30 in 1995. Business rates, now $24.48 a month, would jump to about $27.50 in 1991 and $31 in 1995, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hopley</ENAMEX> said.
