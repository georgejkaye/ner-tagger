<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Sciences Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Segundo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Administration</ENAMEX> will negotiate details of a contract valued at about $170 million to provide software for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ames Research Center</ENAMEX>.
Included in the three-year contract are options for two one-year renewals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> awarded the contract to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> in November but an appeal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Software Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> sent the contract to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals</ENAMEX> and the board required NASA to re-evaluate bidders' proposals. Sterling had completed a five-year contract for NASA but lost its bid for renewal. As directed by the board, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> completed the evaluation and again chose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX>.
For its fiscal year ended March 31, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSC</ENAMEX> had revenue of $1.3 billion.
