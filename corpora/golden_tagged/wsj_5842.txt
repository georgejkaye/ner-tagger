<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> slapped discounts as high as $2,000 on 1990-model pickup trucks that still lack final prices and are only now arriving in dealer showrooms.
The move illustrates how irrelevant final sticker prices are becoming on new cars and trucks. For several years, the Big Three auto makers have inflated new model-year prices to account for later rebates. But rarely have rebates hit new vehicles before the model year begins or official prices are announced.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> set a $750 cash rebate on its 1990 Chevrolet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lumina</ENAMEX> sedan, and an $800 rebate on its 1990 Geo Prizm car earlier this month. But both models were introduced as 1990 models in the middle of the 1989 model year.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> has enjoyed considerable success with its Jeep sport utility vehicles and minivans, its Dodge pickups have lagged behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s recently redesigned full-size pickups and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s F-series light trucks.
The rebates on the 1988, 1989 and 1990-model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> trucks range from $500 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dakota</ENAMEX> S pickup to $2,000 on the two-wheel and four-wheel drive Dodge 100, 150, 250 and 350 pickups.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> also sweetened rebates on several 1988 and 1989-model cars and trucks, including many of the imported cars and trucks it sells. The increased rebates range from $500 on some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plymouth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> Colt imported subcompacts to $2,500 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> Raider imported sport utility vehicle. Previous rebates on those models had been $300 and $2,000 respectively.
Rebates increased to as much as $2,000 on two of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s U.S.-built 1988 and 1989-model cars. Under the new incentive program, which began Saturday, rebates on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Lebaron</ENAMEX>, excluding the convertible model, jumped to $2,000 from $1,500; rebates on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> Daytona coupe increased to $1,500 from $1,000.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said it will continue to offer cut-rate financing ranging from interest-free, 24-month loans to 11.9% on 60-month terms.
