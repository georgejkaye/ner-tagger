President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s bad luck with trees is growing.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has launched a coast-to-coast campaign urging Americans to plant trees because of their ecological benefits, but his latest personal contribution has been uprooted. Over the weekend, vandals yanked out of the ground an elm sapling he planted just a week ago in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spokane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> officials said they don't know whether the tree can be saved.
The damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spokane</ENAMEX> tree follows on the heels of complications with an elm tree Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> gave to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Dakota</ENAMEX> several months ago. That tree turned out to have gypsy moths, destructive insects that state officials said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Dakota</ENAMEX> didn't have before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> brought in his tree.
The elm sapling Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> planted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spokane</ENAMEX> was taken from a tree <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Quincy Adams</ENAMEX> planted on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> grounds in 1826. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> aides found out vandals had uprooted the sapling and torn off some branches, they called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spokane</ENAMEX> officials to offer assistance in saving or replacing it. The aides said that the tree has been taken to a ``secure location'' and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spokane</ENAMEX> officials hope it will recuperate over the winter.
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, the aides said.
