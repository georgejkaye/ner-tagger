<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX> said three of its admissions officers would stop selling information to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and other colleges through a data-processing company they control.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>'s relationship with the company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student Aid Services Inc.</ENAMEX>, was criticized by some educators in the wake of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> inquiry of possible tuition and financial-aid price-fixing among private colleges. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> has helped 23 private schools exchange data on financial aid awards to common admittees, in a process that eliminates differences in the students' out-of-pocket tuition expenses.
The process, called ``overlap,'' is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> inquiry.
The Harvard administrators involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> are Dean of Admissions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William R. Fitzsimmons</ENAMEX>, Assistant Dean of Admissions <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren C. Reed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Director of Financial</ENAMEX> Aid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James S. Miller</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Michael Spence</ENAMEX>, dean of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>'s faculty of arts and sciences, said in a statement yesterday that the university saw nothing wrong with its administrators' involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SAS</ENAMEX>, but was acting to avoid ``even the semblance of inappropriate activities'' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> or the individuals involved.
Through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>, Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitzsimmons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> declined comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Moulton</ENAMEX>, a fourth principal in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SAS</ENAMEX> and director of student aid at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bowdoin College</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brunswick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>, also declined comment, saying he hadn't seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>'s statement.
