<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Evans</ENAMEX>, who last week resigned as president and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> ``for personal reasons'' just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection, has been temporarily reappointed to both positions, the company said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Financial Officer</ENAMEX> and Treasurer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Lloyd</ENAMEX>, 37 years old, would join the nine-member board. He succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Kimmel</ENAMEX>, who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company's role in buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX> was no longer necessary.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> will stay until a successor is found, but not later than the end of the year, the company said.
It was the 49-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> who had moved into the offices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> and run the company during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Australia Ltd.</ENAMEX>'s aborted bid for the movie company. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> terminated the $1.5 billion merger because of a dispute over a $50 million letter of credit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> -- which is 43%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> -- found itself facing problems of its own. And the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Australian company</ENAMEX> appears to be quickly deteriorating.
On Oct. 19, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> was about to default on a $5.9 million payment owed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> in connection with the distribution of a television program. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> was depending on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> to arrange financing. But early on Oct. 19, the second of two hectic days of board meetings, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> said he believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> wouldn't be forthcoming. He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Bankruptcy Code before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> deadline, according to a source familiar with the sessions.
But a majority of the board, which includes three members from the Australian company, overrode him. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> resigned. Later in the day, according to the source, the board reversed itself, decided to file for bankruptcy protection, and asked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> to stay on. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> told the board he needed the weekend to think about it. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evans</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached yesterday for comment.
Last Monday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets. Last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX>.
Separately, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX> shareholder filed suit in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> charging <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> with misleading shareholders about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Entertainment</ENAMEX>'s financial position. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Australia</ENAMEX> said it hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment.
