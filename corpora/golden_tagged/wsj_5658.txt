Arab foreign debt has grown in the past few years to an estimated $140 billion in 1988, compared with $68 billion in 1982, said the monthly bulletin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf International Bank</ENAMEX>.
The report called the level a matter for concern. It cited an average rate of total external debt to gross domestic product of 65.8% in 1987, compared with 52.5% in 1982. The corresponding average rate for the world's 17 most-indebted countries was 63.1% in 1987.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sudan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jordan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Morocco</ENAMEX>, external debt exceeded GDP, the report said. It noted that those four Arab countries, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, also were facing debt-repayment difficulties and have had to reschedule part or all of their debt to reduce their overall debt-service burden. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algeria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Yemen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Yemen</ENAMEX> have been able to forestall debt rescheduling.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mauritania</ENAMEX> have virtually no access to international borrowing, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qatar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX> are able to tap international markets at reasonably good rates.
The remaining Arab countries, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bahrain</ENAMEX>, have opted until now not to borrow internationally, preferring instead to draw on their domestic markets through government bonds and treasury bills.
