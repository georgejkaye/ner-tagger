Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> earthquake.
Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX> last month. The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Reider</ENAMEX>, a vice president in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>'s claims division.
But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers. Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage. Most insurers already have mobilized their ``catastrophe'' teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern California</ENAMEX>.
Since commercial air travel is interrupted, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX> and then planned for them to drive to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area. About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks.
Some adjusters, already in other parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> will be advertising 800 numbers -- probably on the radio -- that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, the largest home and auto insurer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bloomington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.
Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement ``rider'' on a homeowner's policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> said about 25% of its policyholders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> have also purchased earthquake insurance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allstate Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX>, said about 23% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28% in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Franciso</ENAMEX> area -- also have earthquake coverage.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of California Insurance Companies</ENAMEX> estimated damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million is insured, it said.
Officials from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Insurance Association</ENAMEX>'s property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> today. They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two.
Roads and bridges in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highways</ENAMEX>, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX>, generally don't have insurance coverage. Industry officials say the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX> -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds.
However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have ``loss of income'' insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days. That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Novato</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>.
Earthquake-related claims aren't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole. Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear.
Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways. For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy. Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reinsurance</ENAMEX> is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves.
``We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Yankus</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conning & Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX> firm that specializes in the insurance industry. His firm, along with some others, issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday.
Among the insurance stocks, big gainers included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American International Group</ENAMEX>, up $3.25 to $102.625; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Re Corp.</ENAMEX>, up $2.75 to $86.50; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX>, up $2.375 to $59.50; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marsh & Mclennan Inc.</ENAMEX>, up $3.125 to $75.875.
Still, a few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated. ``I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myron Picoult</ENAMEX>. He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo.
British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake disaster. Although it's unclear how much exposure the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> market will face, U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> catastrophe coverage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Byrne</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's Fund</ENAMEX>, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar.
The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 -- when another earthquake sparked the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great San Francisco</ENAMEX> Fire. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orin Kramer</ENAMEX>, an insurance consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, estimates that the 1906 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion. He is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo.
