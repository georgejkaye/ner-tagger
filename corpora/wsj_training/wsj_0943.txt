<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Atlantic Corp.</ENAMEX> said it agreed definitively to acquire one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data Corp.</ENAMEX>'s computer-maintenance businesses. Terms of the accord weren't disclosed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX>'s third-party maintenance unit services products primarily made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> The unit has 6,000 customers and, according to one analyst, had 1988 revenue of about $85 million.
Under the agreement, which had been widely expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Atlantic</ENAMEX> would be buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX>'s customer base and its approximately 100 U.S. maintenance facilities in about 33 cities. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX> would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its Cyber product line.
The unit represents a small portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX>'s overall computer-servicing business, which last year posted sales of about $400 million. Earlier this  year, the company sold a similar unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for about $25 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Perlman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data</ENAMEX>'s president and chief operating officer, said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company's ``strategy to be a data solutions company.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Vassiliades</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Atlantic</ENAMEX>'s customer services division, said the acquisition would give the company's Sorbus computer-maintenance unit added expertise in ``the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies.
