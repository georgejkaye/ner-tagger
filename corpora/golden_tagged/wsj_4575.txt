<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us Inc.</ENAMEX>, which has been gobbling up market share by aggressively expanding operations abroad, is ready for another bite -- this time in cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
The two children's market giants plan to jointly open four to six toy stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> in 1991 and up to 100 stores in the years following, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Nakasone</ENAMEX>, vice chairman and president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX>'s world-wide toy stores.
Under terms of the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochelle Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, will own 80% of the new venture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's of Japan</ENAMEX>, which is 50% owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's Corp.</ENAMEX>, Oak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, will own the remaining equity and have the option of operating restaurants on toy store sites.
The plan would mark the first move by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX> into the Japanese market. It expanded into the Canadian and European markets five years ago and has grown rapidly since.
The concept of combining a fast food outlet with a retail store isn't new. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woolworth Co.</ENAMEX> has been operating 19 Burger King restaurants alongside its department stores. Like other franchisees, it pays Burger King a percentage of its sales.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-style shopping malls are a rarity and mom-and-pop stores dominate retailing, such business combinations could make even greater sense, analysts said. At least initially, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX>, which had been looking for a Japanese partner for two years, will rely on the expertise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> in picking sites.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Den Fujita</ENAMEX>, president of the 675-store <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, ``has a pretty good reputation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Barry</ENAMEX>, toy analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX> is looking for him to open a few doors.''
Although its goal is to open about 100 stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> eventually, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX> officials expect growth in the first few years to be gradual. While stores might do twice the volume of stores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, margins are expected to be about the same, due in part to the high cost of real estate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX> declined to name specific store locations but said they would be in ``major cities.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX> changed the concept of toy retailing by offering consumers ``a supermarket'' of toys at low prices. Its stores are stuffed to the rafters with 18,000 toys, and shoppers use shopping carts.
Five years ago it took that concept to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where the toy supermarket was almost nonexistent. Since 1984 the toy chain has opened 27 stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, 41 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and six in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
For the year ended Jan. 29, 1989, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R'' Us</ENAMEX> reported net income of $268 million, or $2.04 cents a share, on sales of about $4 billion. About 9% of its sales come from foreign markets.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, as in other parts of the world, about 80% of the toys on the shelves will be the same as those sold in the
Under terms of the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s won't participate in the management of the toy stores. ``Our position is that of a passive investor,'' a company spokesman said.
Analysts point out that the strategy is similar in part to an agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX>, which sells children's clothes and toys through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mckid</ENAMEX>'s division. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s deal, certain clothes and toys carry the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s trademark. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toys ``R</ENAMEX>'' Us arrangement, however, toys won't bear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s label.
