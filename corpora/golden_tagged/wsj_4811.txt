<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut Merieux S.A.</ENAMEX> raised the stakes in a bidding war for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught Biosciences Inc.</ENAMEX> with a plan to offer 37 Canadian dollars (US$31.31) for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> share it doesn't already own, giving the company an indicated value of C$942 million (US$797 million).
The offer will replace a proposal made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> last March to combine its human health businesses with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based vaccine manufacturer. That plan would have left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> shareholders with about 49% of the merged company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux Connaught N.V.</ENAMEX>, and drew criticism from shareholders and analysts, who said it was difficult to value.
Earlier this month, a rival bid emerged in the shape of a joint C$30-a-share offer for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>'s shares by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Basel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, pharmaceutical concern, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron Corp.</ENAMEX>, a biotechnology company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Emeryville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
After a weekend board meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> directors recommended shareholders reject the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX>\ offer, and unanimously approved the terms of the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> bid. The bid was not publicly disclosed until yesterday morning.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian King</ENAMEX>, said the Merieux cash offer was the French company's idea, but that the precise terms are the outcome of ``negotiations and discussions'' over the weekend.
``Obviously, there was some skepticism about the short-term value of a merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King</ENAMEX> said, referring to the earlier Merieux merger proposal. In contrast, he said, the market reacted favorably to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX>'s joint cash offer.
Following the announcement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> bid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> shares jumped in active trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> to close at C$37.25 (US$31.53), up C$3.375. In national over-the-counter trading in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the shares closed at $31.75, up $3.125. Several analysts said investors expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> to sweeten their offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>, or for a third bid to emerge.
``People are trying to figure out what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX>'s upper limit is,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avi Dalfen</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> is interested in acquiring the company to gain a foothold in the vaccines business, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> appears most interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>'s production and marketing capacity, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalfen</ENAMEX> said.
``The question is: Is the company worth as much to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> as it is to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Merieux</ENAMEX>?,'' which is trying to develop a critical mass in the increasingly competitive biotechnology market, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalfen</ENAMEX> added.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> said the two companies would review their options after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX>'s offering circular is mailed to shareholders later this week.
``We've made a very good offer, considering the synergies we have that other (companies) don't have,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques-Francois Martin</ENAMEX>, director general of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut Merieux</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> said the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> would help resolve the problem of competing with companies that are able to spend $100 million to $200 million a year on product development.
``There is no future for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> on its own... (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alone</ENAMEX>) we will disappear from the scientific world in a few years,'' he said, referring to each company.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> offer is conditional on the French concern holding 50% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>'s shares, plus one, at the time the bid expires.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> said the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> would be financed by a letter of credit guaranteed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX>'s majority shareholder, state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc SA</ENAMEX>, which will be repaid with the proceeds of a planned equity issue.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> offer is the second major transaction in as many weeks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>, which owns 51% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut Merieux</ENAMEX>. Last week it agreed to buy a speciality chemicals unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Corp.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and the chemicals subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> in separate transactions with a total value of about US$1.3 billion.
