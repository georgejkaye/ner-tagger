<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX>'s third-quarter net income fell 25% to $21.5 million, or 46 cents a share, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics Corp.</ENAMEX> reported nearly flat earnings of $76.5 million, or $1.83 a share.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> recorded an 8.2% decline in sales as B-2 Stealth bomber research-and-development revenue continued to ebb and high costs on some other programs cut into profit. The aerospace concern earned $28.8 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the latest period were $1.25 billion, down from $1.36 billion in the 1988 quarter.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX>, sales rose 10% to $2.52 billion from $2.29 billion. It earned $76.4 million, or $1.82 a share, in the 1988 quarter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments, an earnings recovery in submarine operations, and higher military aircraft sales.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX> said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F\ fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX>
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> shares closed at $21.125, off 25 cents. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> closed at $54.875, up 50 cents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX>, which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development, said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago. Among them were the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ALQ</ENAMEX>-135 electronic countermeasures system for the F-15 fighter. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX>'s interest expense also soared to $35 million from $17 million a year ago. It said debt remained at the $1.22 billion that has prevailed since early 1989, although that compared with $911 million at Sept. 30, 1988.
The backlog of undelivered orders at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> on Sept. 30 was $4.68 billion, down from $5.16 billion a year earlier.
For the nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> reported a net loss of $46.9 million, or $1 a share, compared with profit of $190.3 million, or $4.05 a share, in 1988. Sales dipped 3.6% to $3.92 billion from $4.07 billion.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX>, factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Tactical Fighter</ENAMEX>, and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter. F-16 deliveries also have fallen ``slightly behind schedule,'' although a return to the previous schedule is expected in 1990, the company said.
Backlog at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> rose to $16.5 billion from $15.8 billion. Its interest expense surged to $21.5 million from $12.4 million. For the nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> earned $210.3 million, or $5.03 a share, up marginally from $208.8 million, or $4.97 a share, on a 4.9% rise in sales to $7.41 billion from $7.06 billion.
