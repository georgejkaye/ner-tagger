Three weeks after the 1987 global stock-market collapse, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s ``Irises'' for $54 million. The Australian entrepreneur, who rode out the crash on the cash flow from his beer assets, says he identifies with artists like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX> because they ``showed great inner strength in persisting with their vision.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> could use plenty of inner strength these days. His corporate canvas, which includes brewing, media, resources and property interests, is in tatters. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s regulators have launched an inquiry into his business activities. And yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX> announced a series of maneuvers to raise cash and reduce debt by shedding units, including half of his Australian brewery empire.
Losing control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> would put Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> in the same boat as arch-rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Holmes a Court</ENAMEX>, whose companies were ravaged in the crash, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Herscu</ENAMEX>, the property and retail magnate whose creditors pulled the plug on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. The three men's predicament resembles that of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s economy: They grew too fast and racked up debts beyond their ability to pay.
``It's a get-rich-quick economy,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Johnson</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX> investment banker. ``People have been very oriented to speculation and rapid rises in (asset) values.'' Adds a U.S. lender in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>: ``These entrepreneurs do a whole career's worth in three to five years because they know when times are good they'd better make it --'cause when times are bad, they're really bad.''
The rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s high-flying entrepreneurs is a saga of greed and overambition; of eager bankers peddling expensive credit to insatiable borrowers in a newly unshackled financial system; and of corporate empires built on rising asset values, often lax and sometimes questionable accounting, and a hot stock market full of hungry investors.
``The common thread is they had a narrow equity base, too much debt, too many assets and not enough cash flow,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viktor Shvets</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX> brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capel Court Powell Ltd.</ENAMEX> ``It's certainly the story of Hooker.... It certainly was the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holmes a Court</ENAMEX>, and it is currently the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX>.''
Although many of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s high rollers took the same risky route, bankers and others say that because of conservative management and mature business operations, other big-borrowing companies aren't raising concern. For instance, they aren't worried about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders IXL Ltd.</ENAMEX>, the huge brewing, financial-services, agribusiness and resources concern. Nor are they concerned about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s farflung media empire. And they say companies controlled by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Brierley</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Zealander</ENAMEX> who operates mainly from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, are still safe bets.
All of these entrepreneurs flourished in an era of ``supply-driven lending'' that followed deregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s financial system in 1983, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Iain Thompson</ENAMEX>, general manager of corporate banking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westpac Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> But with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> now committed to keeping interest rates high, that era is over.
The alarm bells are sounding for the economy as well. In late August, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> lowered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s credit rating to double-A-2 from double-A1, citing a perceived ``small but significant increase in the likelihood that Australian borrowers could, at some future date, experience difficulty'' in servicing their debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> owes foreign creditors 137 billion Australian dollars (US$106.3 billion), up from A$67.5 billion in 1985. The bulk of the foreign debt is owed by companies controlled by businessmen such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s relatively high inflation rate, averaging 7.6% annually for the five years through 1988, encouraged investors to buy assets, some economists say. They borrowed to do it. Foreign investment banks became more aggressive, the government granted commercial-bank licenses to 16 foreign banks, and domestic banks moved to defend their respective market shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> loosened credit after the October 1987 crash, fueling an import surge and ballooning the deficit in trade in goods and services. That swelled the foreign-debt burden, so the government raised domestic interest rates to slow demand. Short-term rates have climbed to about 18% from about 11% in March 1988. Domestic interest rates are likely to stay high, causing economists and others to warn of more corporate failure.
For a time, it may have seemed to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> a Court that he couldn't fail. Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Johannesburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>, he settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Perth</ENAMEX>, earned a law degree and began to build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Group Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an empire predicated on rising asset values in transportation, media, entertainment and building supplies. Striking terror in board rooms around the world, he amassed a stake of nearly US$1 billion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> oil company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco Inc.</ENAMEX>, and at home nearly took over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broken Hill Proprietary Co.</ENAMEX>, a mining concern that is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s largest company. By 1987, his estimated fortune of A$1.4 billion made him <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s richest man.
The equities crash changed all that. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> withdrew as lead manager of a A$1 billion bond issue Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> a Court's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX> would have used to reduce its interest bill. Most of the Bell companies' assets were in other listed concerns that produced dividends but didn't give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> a Court access to their cash flow.
As the value of his investments plunged, investors dumped the Bell companies' stock and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> a Court dumped assets, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> stake and most of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BHP</ENAMEX> holdings. Six months after the crash, he sold half of his controlling stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Group</ENAMEX> to an arm of the Western Australian government for A$2.50 a share and the rest to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>
That may have marked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s downfall. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Brown</ENAMEX>, an analyst at brokerage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd.</ENAMEX>, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> ``reached too far'' and paid too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Group</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baring Securities</ENAMEX> estimates its current value at about 74 Australian cents a share. ``If he hadn't acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Group</ENAMEX>, he probably wouldn't be teetering on the brink,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> says. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> didn't respond to requests for an interview.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s Bell purchase ran afoul of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s corporate regulators. He was forced to settle by making a general offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Group</ENAMEX> at A$2.70 a share and acquired 70% of the company. He set about stripping it to reduce debts, but he couldn't resist acquiring more assets along the way, including a 20.4% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonrho PLC</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based conglomerate controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.W.</ENAMEX> ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiny'' Rowland</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s move late last year appeared to presage a takeover attempt.
After the burden he assumed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Group</ENAMEX>, that was his second big mistake. Last week, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonrho</ENAMEX> stake at a loss of about US$77.3 million.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> told an Australian TV reporter in May he ``underestimated the venom of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiny Rowland</ENAMEX>,'' who waged a campaign focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s debt, much of which is owed to banks outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonrho</ENAMEX> attacks made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s lenders balk at providing credit lines, including a US$220 million undrawn facility that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> inherited from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s stock has been hammered to as low as 27 Australian cents from around A$2 late last year.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX> is betting his biggest bank lenders will stick with him. It's a bet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Herscu</ENAMEX> lost. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herscu</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Romanian</ENAMEX> refugee turned property developer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Melbourne</ENAMEX>, grabbed control of conservatively run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> in 1985. He took out loans and spent US$1 billion, in part, on up-market American retailers, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonwit Teller</ENAMEX>.
As Hooker's borrowings grew, so did bankers' unease. Like many Australian companies, particularly ones controlled by entrepreneurs, Hooker was ``extremely reluctant to give information to us,'' says one Australian banker. Many Hooker loans weren't secured by assets. Yet the banks kept credit lines open. ``The idea was he might make it,'' one banker says, but ``high interest rates changed a lot.''
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hooker</ENAMEX>'s bankers forced Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herscu</ENAMEX> to turn the company, with A$1.6 billion in bank debt, over to a court-appointed liquidator. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herscu</ENAMEX>, through an aide, declined to be interviewed.
