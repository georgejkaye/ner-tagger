At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper. Visitors are ushered into the premises by red-frocked doormen known as waiters, a reminder of the insurance market's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s, once a pillar of the world insurance market, is being shaken to its very foundation. The 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters, the most recent of which is last week's earthquake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX>. At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business. The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow, less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s is on the ropes,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Nutting</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence. ``It needs more discipline. It needs to sort itself out.''
Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of ``names,'' the well-heeled investors (some of them royal) who, as members of about 360 syndicates, underwrite policies. Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year, more than triple the number of resignations in 1987. Names are resigning at an even faster pace this year.
Lackluster returns are one reason. The average after-tax return on investment in 1986, the most recent year for which results are available, was 6.5%, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chatset Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an insurance consulting firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. In 1985, it was 2.1%.
Between 1981 and 1986, the most recent five-year period for which figures are available, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> reported over # 3.6 billion in claims and reserves against future losses ($5.7 billion at today's exchange rates), more than double the # 1.35 billion posted in the previous five-year period.
Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange's most basic tenets, the concept of unlimited personal liability. Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims, but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe. And catastrophes are getting ever more costly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s claims for the 1988 Piper Alpha oil-rig disaster in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Sea</ENAMEX>, for instance, may reach $1 billion.
During the five-year period ended 1986, roughly 80% of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates, according to Chatset consultants. The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now. ``I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that's how bad it is,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Atkins</ENAMEX>, a secretary from suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, says.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkins</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s membership was a bonus from a former employer in 1981, belongs to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nutting</ENAMEX>'s dissident group on the Outhwaite syndicate, which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkins</ENAMEX>, who underwrote # 20,000, or about $32,000, of insurance coverage on that syndicate, now faces potential losses of roughly # 70,000, or $111,000. ``If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s wants # 70,000 out of me they will have to take everything I've got -- and even then I don't know if it will be enough,'' she says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unease</ENAMEX> is widespread among exchange members. ``I can't think of any reason to join <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s now,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Whitten</ENAMEX>, a British businessman and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s member since 1979. ``The downside is very considerable, and at the moment the upside is very marginal.'' If profits don't improve, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> says he may quit the exchange.
Meanwhile, competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance. Over the past decade, competitors have chipped away at the exchange's share of the # 2.5 billion marine market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, where half the world's ships are insured.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s 66% stake in that market has shrunk to 50% in that period, according to an official at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> Underwriters, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s competitor. (The official asked not to be named.) Much of the business has gone to the institute, an association of more than 100 insurers, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allianz Versicherungs AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Union Assurance PLC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s has endured decades of genteel decline. At the peak of its power and influence a century ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s dominated the insurance world with a 50% stake. It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe.
Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s share of the world market, excluding life insurance, is about 2%. (Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included.) Bigger rivals, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allianz</ENAMEX>, backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches, operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates, brokers say. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> pioneered such now-standard policies as worker's compensation insurance, burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses, and bankers' liability insurance, competitors now underwrite most of that business.
Beyond that, many big oil, chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through ``captive'' offshore companies for industry-specific coverage. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged. Only 10 years ago, for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses. But since 1981, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirk Horse Insurance Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lexington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX> has grabbed a 20% stake of the market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Kirk</ENAMEX>, president, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s has suffered because its structure doesn't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients; brokers are required intermediaries. Thus, he asserts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s can't react quickly to competition. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s has lost control of the situation,'' he says. ``They aren't controlling their destiny like they used to.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murray Lawrence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s chairman, agrees the exchange faces big challenges. ``This is a watershed time, and we are trying to plot our way ahead,'' he says. ``We have been a great market for inventing risks which other people then take, copy and cut rates.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s, he says, is cut off from ``the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence'' against catastrophic losses. By that, he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance. The exchange, he says, must find new products and new markets.
That won't be an easy task. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tradition</ENAMEX> is dictator at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s. Three years ago, the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charles</ENAMEX> has denounced. (Some exchange wags call the building ``the oil rig.'') But along with such treasured artifacts as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord Nelson</ENAMEX>'s spyglass, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s also brought its outmoded ways of doing business.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s market actively underwrites insurance just 4 1/2 hours a day, brokers say. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underwriting</ENAMEX> doesn't get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m. A two-hour lunch break follows. Things wind down at about 4:30 p.m., just in time for afternoon tea.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks. The hall's few computers are used mostly to send messages. Sandwiched between desks, underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies. Brokers clutching thick folders stand in lines, waiting their turn to speak to the underwriters. A broker may have to approach as many as 20 underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates. It could take six months for a claim to be paid.
``The system,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Samengo-Turner</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s broker who left the exchange in 1985, ``is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad.''
Some maintain underwriters also have been inept. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wetherell</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s underwriter, says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50% the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985. ``How unprofessional we must have appeared to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation,'' he says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> officials decline to comment on the matter.
More recently, property rates have increased. Many at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further. But it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters.
The magnitude of the exchange's problems may not become known for some time because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s only recently reported its financial results for 1986. That year, it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million, a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says reported profit will be down in 1987, 1988 and 1989, though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be. Insurance analysts say the exchange's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $600 million in aviation losses (including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>) and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September's Hurricane Hugo.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s says the departures of names isn't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity, currently about # 11 billion. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names. Meanwhile, the exchange has been trying to lower costs. (It recently cut its work force by 9%, or 213.)
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to embrace modern technology. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wetherell</ENAMEX>, the underwriter, reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer, cutting costs at least 10%. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s has talked for years about computerizing underwriting transactions, the effort hasn't gotten very far. Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information. Both groups cling to traditional face-to-face dealings, even for routine policies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies. Some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the low-margin business by selling some policies directly to consumers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public, and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters, brokers and administrators before being implemented. The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> is moving forward on some fronts, though. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence</ENAMEX> says the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims. By next year, all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims.
