The Democrats are back on the attack, with General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gephardt</ENAMEX> leading the charge up what he insists will be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Juan Hill</ENAMEX>. Yesterday it looked more like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cemetery Ridge</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pickett</ENAMEX>'s Charge by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> leadership on capital gains can be understood only as part of a new effort to mount an activist opposition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>. Frustrated by a popular president who has pre-empted their issues (drugs, the environment), they want to fight. They may have lost this time, but (they believe) they bathed themselves in populist glory, and the war's not over. On the other hand, the defections by 64 rank-and-file Democrats suggest the war plan needs revision.
The vote in particular was a test of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gephardt</ENAMEX>, the new House majority leader and heir-apparent to the legacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Coelho</ENAMEX> partisanship. While he could have retreated on capital gains and struck a compromise, he sided with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caucus</ENAMEX>'s majority liberal wing and decided to charge. The decision fits both his reputation for determination and his desire to win over liberals who have only lately come to trust him.
In a city of chameleons, no politician has remade himself as thoroughly as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Gephardt</ENAMEX>. A product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> machine, he came to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> at age 35 in 1977 as a social and defense conservative. He's since become reliably liberal on every issue of consequence to party activists.
Once in favor of an anti-abortion amendment, he now oppposes it. He once voted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MX</ENAMEX> missile, the B-1 bomber, SDI; this year he was one of only 80 House members who voted for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Black</ENAMEX> Caucus budget slashing defense spending. Once against the minimum wage, he now votes down-the-line with organized labor. A founder of the tax reform drive in the mid-1980s, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> nearly abandoned it when the top tax rate fell too low for his neo-populist tastes.
The makeover was complete by his 1988 presidential campaign, when he emerged as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX>-basher of the $48,000 Hyundai ads. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Shrum</ENAMEX>, the gifted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Kennedy</ENAMEX>-wordsmith, was enlisted to give his speeches the soak-the-rich edge that has now become a trademark. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatsby</ENAMEX>-in-reverse, he's remade himself as a man of ``the little people.''
Some attribute all this to opportunism, but that may not be fair. By the account of his friends, this is now the real <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Gephardt</ENAMEX>. He's a convinced class warrior. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicans</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> says now, favor ``the super-rich.'' A capital gains cut would ``fulfill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leona Helmsley</ENAMEX>'s dream.''
The rhetoric is part of a broader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> vision that populist economics is the only path to Democratic ascendancy. When a liberal think-tank introduced a study this week promoting ``managed trade,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> hosted a lunch to educate his colleagues. At a Democratic forum this spring, he asserted that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dukakis</ENAMEX> would have won if only he'd used Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX>'s populist themes earlier.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> is so convinced that he resists more moderate proposals that bow to economic growth. He rejected a proposal from the moderate Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leadership Council</ENAMEX> for an innovative IRA designed to spur economic growth. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> went instead with the liberal shibboleth of raising income tax rates. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> let it be known that 15 Senate Democrats, including liberals <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Cranston</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kerry</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>), preferred to combine a capital gains cut with a new IRA. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> stuck with soak-the-rich, with resentment over aspiration.
Only such ideological conviction could explain his crusade this week. The leadership lobbied in ways not seen since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Wright</ENAMEX>'s salad days. Prize committee seats were dangled, with at least three Democrats pursuing just one opening on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means.</ENAMEX> Members from tobacco-growing states were told they might get help in defeating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s bill banning smoking on airline flights. The soybean lobby kept quiet, lest a pet bill already passed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> not make it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> floor.
Their most adept move was dividing Democratic conservatives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Stenholm</ENAMEX>, erstwhile boll weevil, was seduced with schmoozing and the hint of a leadership post. (He's also a chameleon: Only a month earlier, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX> had declared for the tax cut.) The leadership also rigged the ``rule'' for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> vote, so that members would technically never have to vote against the tax cut. They'd simply get to vote for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX>'s substitute.
In the end, none of it worked, for reasons that can be summed up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-floor anxiety of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> Democrat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jill Long</ENAMEX>. She had won election earlier this year with 51% of the vote by promising not to raise taxes. She openly agonized on the floor this week that she'd be in jeopardy if she sided with the leadership. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Hayes</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX> Democrat who supported Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> for president, also joined the defectors. ``We have to face the fact that the national Democratic party is sending a message that nobody wants to hear,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hayes</ENAMEX> said after the vote.
Before he mounts another attack, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> will also want to tend to his newest recruits. The Democrat who this year replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Wright</ENAMEX> voted for the tax cut, while the one who replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Coelho</ENAMEX> decided against it only under pressure. Any tax increase is now dead until 1992 unless <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> proposes it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickett</ENAMEX>'s Charge may have been glorious, but no one volunteered for a rerun.
