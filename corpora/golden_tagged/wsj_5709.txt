<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horst W. Schroeder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg Co.</ENAMEX>'s president and heir-apparent to its chief executive officer, resigned unexpectedly, citing ``personal reasons.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> had no further explanation for the 48-year-old executive's sudden departure, which comes as the world's largest cereal company fights to regain market share. The company issued its three-sentence announcement yesterday at the same hour that rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills Inc.</ENAMEX> reported nearly a three percentage-point increase in its share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> ready-to-eat cereal market -- a gain made largely at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s expense.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX>, who was named president and chief operating officer only last December, couldn't be reached for comment. A company spokesman said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX> hadn't come to work, indicating that his letter of resignation apparently was submitted to the chairman and chief executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E. Lamothe</ENAMEX>, over the weekend.
The spokesman said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamothe</ENAMEX> had neither sought nor anticipated the resignation. But, the spokesman added, ``in his 40 years he's seen other things like this and he's not alarmed.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamothe</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX>'s appointment as president and chief operating officer -- positions that were vacant for two years -- had been interpreted as a prelude to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s chairmanship for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX>. The current chairman is 62, and traditionally company officers retire at age 65.
Moreover, because Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamothe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX> had appeared at a major news conference together just last month -- they announced proposed industry standards on the touchy issue of health claims for food -- analysts suggested that some recent event had altered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamothe</ENAMEX>'s view of the West German as his successor. Several mentioned reports that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX>'s direct, no-nonsense manner had upset subordinates, who may have made their feelings known to the chairman.
``He wasn't getting the right relationship with people below him, with those ultimately responsible for market share and for beating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Maguire</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> Another analyst, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mcmillin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX>, said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX> ``wouldn't have left unless he thought he was in jeopardy of losing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEO</ENAMEX>'s job.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s board is to meet later this week, and some on Wall Street expect that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamothe</ENAMEX> will use that occasion to elaborate on his chief lieutenant's departure -- and perhaps name a successor. Among those prominently named for the presidency are two executive vice presidents: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary E. Costley</ENAMEX>, who is in charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Food Products</ENAMEX> division, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold G. Langbo</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg International.</ENAMEX>
Until a successor is named, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamothe</ENAMEX> will assume the responsibilities of the president's office, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> said. Part of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX>'s tasks was to oversee marketing strategy for the $4.3 billion company, which, with a market share of nearly 39%, continues to dominate the domestic cold-cereal market.
But while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> was at the forefront in promoting cereals as healthy foods, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> has done better at cashing in on that belief -- particularly in feeding the nation's oat-bran craze with its war horse Cheerios. Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> announced it had achieved a 27% market share during its first quarter ended Aug. 27, up from a 24.6% in fiscal 1989.
``Much of this gain reflects growth of the three Cheerios brand products,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> said. Cheerios and the spinoff Honey Nut and Apple Cinnamon varieties, with a combined 10% market share, recently knocked off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frosted Flakes</ENAMEX> as the biggest selling brand in the country.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> has been scrambling to recover, and in addition to several oat-based cereals recently announced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heartwise</ENAMEX>, a cereal containing psyllium fiber. But on that score as well, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX> was out in front, with its Benefit flakes introduced last April. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psyllium</ENAMEX> is said by the cereal makers to be instrumental in reducing levels of blood cholesterol.
While such health-oriented cereals as Common Sense oat bran have been doing well for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX>, stalwarts such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corn Flakes</ENAMEX>, Rice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krispies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frosted Flakes</ENAMEX> have been giving up share. ``The poor performance of the company recently in terms of market share... may have disrupted relations between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamothe</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nomi Ghez</ENAMEX>, food analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>
Although he came from a financial background, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX> made points at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> by pushing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mueslix</ENAMEX> brand cereal concept several years ago -- despite a chorus of doubters within the company. An adaptation of an old-line European cereal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mueslix</ENAMEX> is a mix of dense flakes mixed with dried fruits and nuts.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> in 1970 after working as an accountant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. He spent most of his 19 years with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> on the international side. Because of solid sales gains in that division, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX> was promoted to president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg North America</ENAMEX> in 1986. He was elected a director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg</ENAMEX> this past April.
A West German by birth, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX> remains a citizen of that country. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> records show that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroeder</ENAMEX> has lived and worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> under a so-called green card since 1985 and that he has not applied for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American citizenship.</ENAMEX>
