<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s inconclusive and contentious five days of debate here this week again has oil ministers on the brink of a production free-for-all, trying not to slip over.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Petroleum Exporting</ENAMEX> Countries' production will almost certainly rise from its already above-target 22 million barrels a day as a result of this week's meeting. And if that weakens prices much, the fear is that a couple of big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> producers could open their spigots to maintain sorely-needed revenues. That happened as recently as a year ago, pushing OPEC prices to between $10 and $13 a barrel.
So far, ministers, delegates and others interviewed here in the wake of the meeting contend OPEC can avoid that. They believe the  fourth-quarter increase won't be sufficient to put OPEC production at or beyond the late-1988 peak of 23 million barrels a day. And because of strong demand, they don't expect OPEC prices to decline much, if at all, from the current average of near $17 a barrel.
``I am optimistic that this arrangement will work and won't harm prices in the fourth quarter,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ginandjar Kartasasmita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indonesia</ENAMEX>'s oil minister who held a leading role in the negotiations. He predicted relatively stable oil markets until OPEC meets again in November.
The oil ministers settled on a modest rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s official fourth-quarter output ceiling to 20.5 million barrels a day from the current 19.5 million. They rejected a 21.5-million barrel ceiling that some argued would more realistically reflect actual output and demand.
Nonetheless, the fact that they delayed action on a proposed restructuring of their antiquated quota system and divided a modest increase among the 13 member states on the existing formula underscores their inability to resolve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s most crucial issue -- quota violations.
``We have given no pledges,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah</ENAMEX>, the oil minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX>, which is freely producing almost double its current quota of 1.1 million barrels a day. In truth, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX>, nor some other chronic quota violators has the ability to produce a lot more at the moment and thus trigger a price tailspin. Several other producers are also within quota for the same reason.
On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, with its growing potential, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s biggest producer, are capable of pouring vast volumes of additional oil into the marketplace if they choose.
Issam <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi</ENAMEX>, the Iraqi oil minister, suggested in an interview that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> doesn't plan to do that. ``Now that we are agreed on a new ceiling, we, like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, will abide by our quota and see what happens,'' he said. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> prefers a firm oil price to higher volumes.
It is understood <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> also intends to stay within its new allotment of five million barrels a day -- unless the price of oil plunges. Then, however, OPEC sources said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> would increase production to maintain its revenues. That, alone, could lead to a further price drop, prompting still higher Saudi output.
The kingdom is such a large producer that under the new fourth-quarter ceiling its percentage increase alone will add 245,000 barrels a day to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s legitimate output. And it has awesome production power, which it has used in the past to penalize OPEC quota-breakers. Though it has stuck to its quota this year, it led last year's output race.
