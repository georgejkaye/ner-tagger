<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> said it raised the rating of about $25 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagull</ENAMEX>'s convertible exchangeable preferred stock, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ba</ENAMEX>-2 from single-B-2. The ratings concern said the upgrade is based on the belief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> natural gas transmission and marketing concern can sustain its improved financial performance, and assumes that there will be future improvement in gas demand and pricing. Additionally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's</ENAMEX> said the rating takes into account <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagull</ENAMEX>'s relatively aggressive but manageable use of debt to finance periodic acquisitions.
