President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is considering casting a line-item veto as a test to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto, which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill. He has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending.
But some analysts, particularly conservative legal scholars, have urged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a line-item veto. Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that would clarify whether a president already has such power.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX>, confirming comments made this week by Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX>, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is ``interested'' in finding a suitable test case. But he also said that exercising a test line-item veto isn't a ``top initiative'' on the president's agenda because he faces more-pressing budget issues at the moment.
