Pittston Co. officials said the United Mine Workers have ended their occupation of the company's coal preparation plant.
The group of about 100 UMW members and supporters left the plant Wednesday night after a judge ordered the union to leave or risk paying substantial fines. The group had shut down the plant, located near Dante, Va., Sunday as part of the UMW's five-month strike against the Greenwich, Conn. company.
Meanwhile, Paul Douglas, Pittston's chairman and chief executive officer, has asked Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, chairman of the Senate Labor subcommittee, to hold a public hearing on the dispute.
