<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heidi Ehman</ENAMEX> might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans. White, 24 years old, a singer in her church choir, she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>. ``I felt kind of safe,'' she says.
No longer. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehman</ENAMEX> opened her mind to Democratic politics. Then a political novice, she stepped into a whirl of ``pro-choice'' marches, house parties and fund-raisers. Now she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Passaic County</ENAMEX> for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Florio</ENAMEX>.
``This is one where I cross party lines,'' she says, rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>'s opponent, Reagan-Republican Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Courter</ENAMEX>. ``People my age thought it wasn't going to be an issue. Now it has -- especially for people my age.''
Polls bear out this warning, but after a decade of increased Republican influence here, the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>. Unless he closes the gap, Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month. Going into the 1990s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past.
This change comes less from a shift in public opinion, which hasn't changed much on abortion over the past decade, than in the boundaries of the debate. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>'s own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> ruling, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>, has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue.
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion. Now, the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension, bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces. A recent pro-choice rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trenton</ENAMEX> drew thousands, and in a major reversal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest.
``If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> hadn't happened, you wouldn't be here,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Bowker</ENAMEX> tells a reporter in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Trenton</ENAMEX> office of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Organization</ENAMEX> for Women. ``We could have shouted from the rooftops about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>... and no one would have heard us.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year. The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cherry Hill</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Abortion Rights Action League</ENAMEX>, whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters, targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause. The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders; ``I wish I could go work out,'' says a slim activist. A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to ``man and woman'' Election Day phones.
No age group is more sensitive than younger voters, like Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehman</ENAMEX>. A year ago this fall, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> voters under 30 favored <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> by 56% to 39% over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dukakis</ENAMEX>, according to a survey then by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rutgers University</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagleton Institute</ENAMEX>. A matching <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eagleton</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX> Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal. Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55% to 29% over Republican <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>.
Abortion alone can't explain this shift, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate. By a 2-to-1 ratio, voters appear more at ease with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>'s stance on abortion, and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue.
``The times are my times,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camden County</ENAMEX> congressman still carries himself with a trademark ``I'm-coming-down-your-throat'' intensity, but at a pause in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus</ENAMEX> Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old Italian-American ward. After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor's race, he has prepared himself methodically for this moment, including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions.
``If you're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right,'' he asks, ``how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not?''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>, by comparison, seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> before national cameras at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>-Contra hearings two years ago. Looking back, he says he erred by stating his ``personal'' opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he wouldn't impose his views on ``policy'' as governor. It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate.
``He doesn't know himself,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy Stanwick</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abortion Rights League</ENAMEX> says of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>'s position. Even abortion opponents, however angry with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>, can't hide their frustration with the Republican's ambivalence. ``He doesn't want to lead the people,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Traynor</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> Right to Life.
Moreover, by stepping outside the state's pro-choice tradition, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment. He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate; and by wavering on this issue and abortion, he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides.
Elected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in 1978, the 48-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>. Like many of his colleagues, he didn't serve in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> and the writers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving Kristol</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gilder</ENAMEX> were influences, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>'s own conservative credentials proved useful to the current <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> GOP governor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Kean</ENAMEX>, in the 1981 Republican primary here.
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>'s fortunes, but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate, pro-choice Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX>. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warren County</ENAMEX> congressman pursued an anti-government, anti-tax agenda in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX> was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>'s budget in his eight years in office.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kean</ENAMEX> forces play down any differences with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>, but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>'s free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX>'s own insurance commissioner. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers.
Fluent in Spanish from his days in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX> actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head. He is warm and polished before a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto</ENAMEX> Rican <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asbury Park</ENAMEX>. Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government, he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office. ``I don't think we do now,'' he says. ``I think we did.''
Asked the same question after his appearance, Democrat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today. When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization's 20th anniversary, he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camden</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Details</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camden</ENAMEX> are essential Florio. Elected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> as a ``Watergate baby'' in 1974, he ran for governor three years later. In the opinion of many, he hasn't stopped running since, even though he declined a rematch with Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kean</ENAMEX> in 1985. His base in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Jersey</ENAMEX> and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge. With limited budgets for television in a high-priced market, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>'s higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage.
More than ever, his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state. Auto insurance rates are soaring. A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monmouth</ENAMEX>, an important swing area, Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county ``clean and green.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> savors this vindication, but at age 52, the congressman is also a product of his times and losses. He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21; to increase state revenue he focuses not on ``taxes'' but on ``audits'' to cut waste. Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Courter</ENAMEX>'s team, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX> retools himself as the lean, mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s. Appealing to a young audience, he scraps an old reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozzie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet</ENAMEX> and instead quotes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grateful Dead</ENAMEX>. The lyric chosen -- ``long strange night'' -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar.
The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines, but his ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camden</ENAMEX> remain a sore point because of the county's past corruption. His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state, and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment, he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trenton State College</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>'s forcefulness on the abortion issue after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster</ENAMEX> ruling divides some of his old constituency. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pasquale Pignatelli</ENAMEX>, an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Essex County</ENAMEX> Irish bagpipe band, speaks sadly of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>. ``I am a devout Catholic,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pignatelli</ENAMEX>, a 40-year-old health officer. ``I can't support him because of abortion.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Wames Sr</ENAMEX>., 72, is Catholic too, but unfazed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florio</ENAMEX>'s stand on abortion. A security guard at a cargo terminal, he wears a Sons of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> jacket and cap celebrating ``The US 1 Band.'' ``I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases,'' he says. ``If you want more opinions ask my wife. She has lots of opinions.
