<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pioneer Inc.</ENAMEX> said it agreed in principle to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pioneer Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> subsidiary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBJ Insurance Cos.</ENAMEX> for $27 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pioneer</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pioneer Savings Bank</ENAMEX>, said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company.
Recently, the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares. The company said the move was necessary to meet capital requirements.
The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies, including the insurance departments of the states of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>, the company said.
In the second quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pioneer</ENAMEX> reported a loss of $7.3 million, compared with net income of $1.1 million a year earlier. The banking operation had a loss of $8.7 million in the second quarter, largely because of problem real-estate loans, while the insurance operations earned $884,000.
