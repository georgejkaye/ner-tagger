<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sebastian Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> took over the oil workers union, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s most powerful labor organization, only last January. But even in that short time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joaquin Hernandez Galicia</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX>.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</ENAMEX> used the army to oust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX>, who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petroleos Mexicanos</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>, one of the world's most inefficient oil companies. Now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> is facing accusations that he's as much a company man as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX> was a crook.
In recent contract negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> management, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union's role in subcontracting, long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings. And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> replacing the prickly populism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX>, government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX>'s new order hasn't arrived without resistance. Brawls between union factions still erupt at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> installations. Leftist leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuauhtemoc Cardenas</ENAMEX> publicly questioned Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX>'s ``moral quality,'' suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country's oil, a symbol of Mexican nationalism, to foreigners.
The 61-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> takes such criticisms in stride. ``This isn't a new kind of union leadership, it's a new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>. We're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital,'' he says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>, which produces 40% of government revenue, desperately needs new investment. Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982, the government has siphoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>'s coffers to make payments on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s $97 billion foreign debt. Little money has been returned to upgrade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>'s aging facilities. While the government drains <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> from above, the union has drained it from below. A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>'s operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each $1 in sales, far above the industry norm.
The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> has been importing gasoline this year. Some projections show <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> importing crude by the end of the century, barring an overhaul of operations. ``Whatever you tried to change, whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners, the big obstacle was the old union leadership,'' says oil consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Baker</ENAMEX>.
Enter Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX>, who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salinas</ENAMEX>. ``I'm the secretary-general, if there is one,'' he says, greeting a visitor to his office. Beginning as a laborer in a refinery, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> put in more than 40 years at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> before being pushed into retirement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX> after a dispute two years ago.
Though he also long benefited from the system built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Quina</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> says union perks had simply gotten out of hand. They are ``at the base of all of the problems of corruption,'' he says.
Thus, in recent contract negotiations, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> gave up the union's right to assign 40% of all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>'s outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks. The union also ceded the 2% commission it had received on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> maintenance contracts. (The union will keep a 2% commission on construction projects.)
The new contract also eliminates the $15 monthly coupon, good only at union-owned grocery stores, that was part of the salary of every worker, from roughneck to chief executive. About 9,800 technical workers, notably chemists and lawyers, were switched to non-union status. Also, because of its reduced capital budget, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers, reducing the work force to about 140,000, the union leader says. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> says the union's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22% increase in compensation.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract. ``We are retaking the instruments of administration,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raul Robles</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> subdirector. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> officials wouldn't say how much money the new contract would save the company, but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $500 million a year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>'s customers also are pleased with the company's new spirit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grupo Desc</ENAMEX>, a big conglomerate, has long depended on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material. But when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> plant shut down for an annual overhaul, it would never give notice to its customers. ``The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernesto Vega Velasco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Desc</ENAMEX>'s finance director. This year, for the first time, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Desc</ENAMEX> and other customers were consulted well in advance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX> plant's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience.
Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals, which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years. In May, the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners, long limited to a 40% stake in secondary petrochemical companies, to own up to 100%. Later, the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>'s courtship with private companies, and especially foreign ones, is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938. ``They are preparing the workers for what's coming: foreign control,'' wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heberto Castillo</ENAMEX>, a leftist leader.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guzman Cabrera</ENAMEX> and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products. But the new union leader makes no apologies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pemex</ENAMEX>'s more outward-looking attitude. ``If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence, sooner or later we're going to become victims of our own isolation,'' he says.
