<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch Corp.</ENAMEX> said its agreement to sell the company to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantis Group Inc.</ENAMEX> has been terminated.
It wasn't immediately clear why the agreement fell through. In a statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX>, a wood furniture and defense products company, said only that the agreement had ``terminated by its own terms.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantis</ENAMEX> declined to comment, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX> officials did not return phone calls seeking comment.
In June the companies signed an agreement in principle calling for Atlantis to pay $23.50 a share, or about $50 million, for the 81% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX>'s shares it didn't already own. The companies were to reach a definitive agreement by Sept. 5.
Earlier in June, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX> agreed to be acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Home Products Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, for $23.50 a share. But that deal also failed to materialize, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX> said, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Home Products</ENAMEX> failed to prove it could raise money for the deal by a specified deadline.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantis</ENAMEX> had been trying to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX> since last fall, when it made a $23.50-a-share offer but was rebuffed. In January, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX> agreed to discuss an acquisition but called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantis</ENAMEX>'s price ``inadequate.''
Yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX> said that it ``would not rule out further acquisition discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantis</ENAMEX>'' but that it will also ``examine alternative avenues to maximize shareholder value.''
As part of that effort, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX> said it will continue its plans to sell its defense products companies. The company said it anticipates completing the sale of one of the companies for $3.7 million this week, and another for $13 million in cash and $3 million in stock by Oct. 31. Last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rospatch</ENAMEX> said it had agreed in principle to sell a third defense products unit for about $4 million in cash.
