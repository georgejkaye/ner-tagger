<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX>, saying that it wanted to cash in on an investment that had soared in value, sold about half of its interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, in a move that will bring the U.S. auto maker about $310 million after taxes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials said that the sale wasn't prompted by an urgent need for the money. But the cash certainly will come in handy in funding the huge capital outlays that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> plans over the next few years -- a time when auto-industry profits are expected to tumble. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> already is in the midst of a $1 billion-plus cost-cutting plan that includes reducing the white-collar work force by about 8%.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> said the move won't adversely affect their many cooperative efforts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> supplies cars and trucks -- about 160,000 last yearthat  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> sells under its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plymouth</ENAMEX> and Eagle marques, and also such key components as engines. In addition, the two companies have a 50-50 partnership in an assembly plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Normal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> have one of the oldest ``alliances'' between major auto makers, although it has been marked by tension from time to time.
Last Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said it sold 75 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> shares, or about 45% of the total 168.9 million that it owned, to 25 Japanese banks and other financial institutions for about $592 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s after-tax profit of $310 million, or $1.33 a share, is to be realized in the third quarter. The transaction reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> to 12.1% from 21.8%.
All of the purchasing institutions are current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> shareholders, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX> the largest single shareholder.
The strong market for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> has made this, ``a good time to reduce the size of our stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MMC</ENAMEX> and realize some significant value for our shareholders,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee A. Iacocca</ENAMEX> said in a statement. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> went public last December, the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s holdings in the company increased to about $1.4 billion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said, from the $315 million that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> has invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> over the years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> made its initial investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> in 1971, taking a 15% stake. In 1985, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> boosted its stake to 24%, but that portion was diluted to 21% by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX>'s initial public stock offering last December.
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> closed Friday at $25.50, up 25 cents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> plans to use the cash to strengthen its balance sheet and to fund some of its capital projects, especially its five-year, $14 billion automotive product development program, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.S. Miller Jr.</ENAMEX>, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> also said the funds would be used to ensure the continuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s stock buy-back program, which authorizes the company to buy back about 33 million more of its about 234 million shares.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> isn't strapped for cash, but isn't throwing off loads of it either,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy Beale Needham</ENAMEX>, an auto analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Upham & Co.</ENAMEX> Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Needham</ENAMEX> said the prospect of tighter federal fuel economy standards may force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> to develop and build a small car in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> to replace its subcompact Dodge <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plymouth Horizon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials would prefer to import a replacement vehicle, but that wouldn't lower the average fuel-economy of their U.S.-built vehicles.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> had about $448 million in working capital at the end of June, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said that figure would increase by the amount that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> will receive for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> shares. But even without the added money, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> would have been able to fund its current capital projects, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> have been linked for a long time, the companies have clashed at times in recent years as their needs and ambitions have evolved. Two years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> cars through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> dealer network in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> refused, but has since agreed to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benz</ENAMEX> cars. More recently the companies clashed over the pricing of cars built at their U.S. joint venture plant.
Nonetheless, analysts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> believe that the companies will continue a solid working relationship. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> needs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX>'s products and technology, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> needs U.S. sales through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s dealer network. ``It is difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> to do business alone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hideaki Suzuki</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wako Research Institute</ENAMEX>, an affilliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wako Securities Co.</ENAMEX>
