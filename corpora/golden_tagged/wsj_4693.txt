<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westcoast Energy Inc.</ENAMEX> said separately that they will delay proposals to build a total of about two billion Canadian dollars (US$1.7 billion) of ethylene projects in western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nova</ENAMEX> is a pipeline, oil and gas, and petrochemical concern based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calgary</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westcoast</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vancouver</ENAMEX>, has oil, gas, and pipeline interests.
Analysts said the postponements may partly reflect concerns by both companies about industry overcapacity, and weakening prices for ethylene, a key petrochemical building block used to make plastics, anti-freeze and other products.
``I'd anticipate that there would be more delays'' of planned ethylene plants, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Kuhlke</ENAMEX>, an executive at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dewitt & Co.</ENAMEX>, a petrochemical consulting firm. ``There have been more {new} plant announcements than are needed to satisfy demand, according to most forecasts,'' he added.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuhlke</ENAMEX> said ethylene plants scheduled to open in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> are expected to raise U.S. ethylene output to about 48 billion pounds annually by 1992, from about 38 billion pounds last year. That increase represents about 10% of current world-wide production of about 100 billion pounds a year, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> analyst said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova</ENAMEX> said its proposed C$1.1 billion ethylene project at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Joffre</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>, will be delayed at least a year beyond its scheduled 1992 start-up, mainly because the company recently lost an expected contract to supply ethylene to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G.L. Clark</ENAMEX>, senior vice president, manufacturing, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nova</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novacor Chemicals Ltd.</ENAMEX> unit, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nova</ENAMEX> expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide</ENAMEX> to purchase about 40% of the new plant's projected output of 1.1 billion pounds of ethylene annually.
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nova</ENAMEX> still plans to build an ethylene plant at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Joffre</ENAMEX>, where its two existing plants produce 3.2 billion pounds of ethylene a year. ``But it won't be in the same time frame'' as previously announced, he said, adding: ``I think the time frame could be extended by a year or two, or even three.''
Previously, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide</ENAMEX> confirmed that it will instead purchase the ethylene from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>'s Canadian unit, which is building a C$800 million ethylene plant near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edmonton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>. A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical Canada Inc.</ENAMEX> said the plant is still scheduled to go on stream as expected by 1993, with capacity set at one billion pounds of ethylene annually.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westcoast Energy</ENAMEX> said it decided ``to defer further work'' on a proposed ethylene plant and related facilities at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taylor</ENAMEX>, in northeastern British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. The plant would have cost as much as C$900 million to build. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westcoast</ENAMEX> said the project, which it planned in partnership with a group of Taiwanese concerns, wasn't large enough to be economically viable. It would have produced about 660 million pounds of ethylene annually, with associated plants producing derivative products, including polyethylene.
``It was too small. There's no point in putting a two-thirds world-scale plant in the middle of nowhere,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> analyst, referring to the planned Westcoast venture.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westcoast</ENAMEX> said the scale of its project was limited by the amount of ethane available. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethane</ENAMEX> is a component of natural gas, which is less abundant in British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> than in neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westcoast</ENAMEX> said a rise in ethane supplies would permit it to increase the scale of the proposed project, but it didn't offer specifics, or a possible time frame for resuming discussions.
