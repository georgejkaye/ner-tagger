Short interest for the month ended Sept. 15 fell 1.3% on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> but crept up less than 1% to a record on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>, short interest slipped to 547,347,585 shares from 554,537,766 a month earlier. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX>, short interest reached 51,887,168 shares from an adjusted 51,844,137.

A trader who sells short borrows stock and sells it, betting that the stock's price will decline and that he can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back.
Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
The level of negative sentiment measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> short interest ratio rose to 3.38 from last month's 3.13. The ratio is the number of trading days, at the exchange's average trading volume, that would be required to convert the total short interest position.
Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions.
The largest Big Board short position was posted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bristol-Myers Co.</ENAMEX>, which more than doubled to 19.6 million shares from 9.4 million as of Aug. 15. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bristol</ENAMEX> is acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb Corp.</ENAMEX> for stock, and short-sellers have been reported to be targeting pharmaceutical companies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>, a bellwether issue, dropped to 2.4 million shares from 2.7 million.
Leading the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amex</ENAMEX> shorts again was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX>, although the short position in the airline company again dropped, this time to 3.4 million shares from 3.7 million.
The largest Big Board drop in short interest volume was that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panhandle Eastern Corp.</ENAMEX>, a pipeline company, to 495,904 shares from 6.4 million. The company has sold all major non-pipeline assets -- sooner than expected -- from its acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Eastern Corp.</ENAMEX> Analysts also note that gas companies' stocks have been rising on speculation that natural gas prices will climb strongly, with shortages possible during the peak winter season.
Another closely watched issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX>, was second on the volume-decliner list, falling to 5.1 million shares from 8.5 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasbro Inc.</ENAMEX> showed the biggest volume drop on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX>, to 50,246 shares from 1.5 million. Analysts are closely watching for -- and some are touting -- the toy company's Record Breakers model racing cars, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hasbro</ENAMEX> is expected to unveil in the next few weeks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bristol-Myers</ENAMEX> also posted the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> volume increase, while Fruit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loom Inc.</ENAMEX> led on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amex</ENAMEX>, rising to nearly two million shares from 1.2 million.
The adjacent tables show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amex</ENAMEX> issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-September or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-August (see accompanying tables -- WSJ Sept. 22, 1989).
