<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to surrender substantial control of its retail empire to real-estate powerhouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX> in exchange for a rescue loan of $250 million.
The move could help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s beleaguered retail divisions -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores</ENAMEX> -- get badly needed merchandise in time for the holiday shopping season.
Under the accord, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York</ENAMEX> will be primarily responsible for supervising a major restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>. The agreement also represents a sharp reversal of fortunes for the mercurial chief, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX>, who just two years ago promised to reign over a continental retail empire.
Apparel makers, many of whom halted shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> last week, had a mixed reaction to the loan agreement. Some said they would immediately start shipping again, especially to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Federated</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s chain, but others hadn't reached a decision yet on resuming shipments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT Group</ENAMEX>, the largest factoring company for the retail industry, said it told clients to resume shipments, but other factors appeared more cautious. Factoring companies buy retail receivables from apparel makers and in many cases act as their credit managers.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> shares closed at 14.25 Canadian dollars, up 75 Canadian cents. In national over-the-counter trading in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the stock closed at $11.875, up $1. Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stock had been halted since last Wednesday.
Under the terms of the pact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>, which is owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reichmann</ENAMEX> family, will increase its fully diluted equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, also based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>, to 38.4% from 25%. The fully diluted equity interest of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive  officer, will fall to 43.2% from 54%.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s board was cut to 10 from 21 with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reichmanns</ENAMEX> naming three directors each. The other four directors represent minority shareholders.
In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> called the new arrangement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> a permanent ``50-50 partnership'' and disputed suggestions he has surrendered management of his real-estate and retailing empire to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Reichmanns</ENAMEX>. ``We wanted their help and their support and that's what we've obtained,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> said. ``I feel very good about it.''
The major financial restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> would seek to reduce its $10 billion in debt and improve cash flow. A committee of four <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> directors headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s chief operating officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lionel Dodd</ENAMEX>, will oversee the restructuring. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> isn't on the committee.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s U.S. subsidiary will have a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer who will report directly to the restructuring committee. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Burden</ENAMEX> will remain chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX>, but he said he didn't know who will be the new chief executive and chief financial officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> U.S.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> said he expects that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> loan, coupled with proceeds from the planned sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s and an $800 million bridge loan that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> will use its ``best efforts'' to arrange, will put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> back on firm footing. He doesn't expect that he will have to sell any more retailing assets to reduce debt.
In an apparent rebuff of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX>, the restructuring committee will retain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> as its financial advisor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston Group</ENAMEX>, initially arranged much of the financing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> acquisitions. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> executive, who requested anonymity, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>'s involvement isn't surprising because it has previously worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y. First Boston</ENAMEX> will continue to act as agent in the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s.
In an interview, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis X. Basile</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX>'s factoring unit, said the company told clients yesterday morning they could resume shipping to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX>. But he added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> will carefully watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> situation. ``Right now we don't feel like we're in possession of all of the facts,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basile</ENAMEX> said.
Other factoring companies were more cautious. ``There is a certain credibility gap that needs to be closed,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Zimmerman</ENAMEX>, senior vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citizens & Southern Commercial Corp.</ENAMEX> ``Until recently we were told that everything was fine at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and that there were no cash flow problems. Last week, suddenly, cash flow was inadequate and there was a big problem.''
``Basically we feel a little better knowing that this financing is in place. But we don't know if this solves the problem through the end of Christmas,'' added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Derita</ENAMEX>, senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Talcott Corp.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derita</ENAMEX> said his company is waiting to receive payment on September payables before it releases any of its manufacturers to ship new merchandise to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX>.
Apparel makers expressed relief over the financing, but they too are cautious. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Mori</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Takihyo Inc.</ENAMEX>, which makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne Klein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Karan</ENAMEX> clothes, said he will only resume shipments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s at this point. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s is considered such a critical outlet by many manufacturers that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guess Jeans Inc.</ENAMEX> president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Marciano</ENAMEX> said he plans to ship to the chain ``even if I have to carry them at my own risk.''
Even if most manufacturers resume shipments, the vital Christmas season may still be difficult for vendors and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX>. Many retail executives expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> will quickly run through the $250 million loan because many apparel makers are now planning to either cut <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s credit lines or require some payments in advance of delivery.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Beebe Longley</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX>, said manufacturers may be forced to bear the brunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s problems. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reichmann</ENAMEX> brothers will try to increase cash flow,'' she said, ``which means that payments will probably be delayed. The department stores have historically been notorious for pushing their problems back onto the manufacturers, and I expect them to do so even more.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> is willing to provide a portion of the refinancing for the $800 million bridge loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> agreed to try to arrange.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s participation is conditional on the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s buy-back of 75% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated's and Allied</ENAMEX>'s $2.4 billion of debentures, notes and preferred stock outstanding at Sept. 15 prices or lower. Prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> bonds rose yesterday, which may make it difficult for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> to buy back the bonds at a price acceptable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y.</ENAMEX>
Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> has been unable to obtain a commitment to refinance a $400 million bridge loan held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> and others, the debtholders have received a 7% equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> said yesterday that under new agreements with the debtholders it has certain rights to reacquire the stock.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> will use a portion of the $250 million loan to make an interest payment due last Friday on its 11 1/2% senior subordinated debentures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> also said its banks agreed to increase the $600 million cash-draw limit on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX>'s working capital credit lines by $50 million and extend the deadline on $1.05 billion in debt due this January to April
Under the loan agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> will receive warrants entitling it to buy as many as 15.6 million common shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> at $16 each until Sept. 18, 1991. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> also has the right to apply the amount outstanding under its loan to the purchase of the shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> said they mutually agreed to certain restrictions, including rights of first refusal, on their ability to buy or transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stock.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J. Debartolo Corp</ENAMEX>. ``remains what it was,'' although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Debartolo</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J. Debartolo</ENAMEX> isn't on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s new board. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debartolo</ENAMEX>, a real-estate developer based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Youngstown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, lent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> $480 million during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> takeover. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> said reports that Debartolo opposed terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> loan and delayed resolution of the loan agreement were ``totally unfair.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s joint-venture real estate development partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Debartolo</ENAMEX> is intact, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debartolo</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
