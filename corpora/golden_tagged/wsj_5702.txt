<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> is trying to lure the executive producer of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Tonight</ENAMEX>,'' to work on the morning ``Today'' show and develop a variety of programs for the network, people close to the talks said.
The executive producer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Nuell</ENAMEX>, has reportedly been offered in excess of $2 million over three years, an unusually high sum for a producer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuell</ENAMEX>, a former news director at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>-owned station in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, prior to joining ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entertainment Tonight</ENAMEX>'' in 1987, is credited with the ratings and editorial resurgence of the daily program, produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Television</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>
The deal does not only include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>, however, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuell</ENAMEX> would also work with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Sports</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Entertainment</ENAMEX> in a unique relationship to develop programs for three divisions of one network. The negotiations involved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Entertainment</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brandon Tartikoff</ENAMEX> as well as the presidents of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nuell</ENAMEX> didn't return phone calls to his office.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>, is the only one of the three major U.S. network news divisions not to have a regularly scheduled program in prime time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>' most recent attempt, ``Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow,'' has had three airings. The program has done well in the ratings, but has been drubbed by critics.
The ``Today'' show has undergone a number of changes since last month, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> Sports President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Ebersol</ENAMEX> to assume the additional responsibility of overseeing ``Today.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ebersol</ENAMEX>, who has been an executive producer of the network's ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Friday Night Videos,'' replaced on-air correspondent/news reader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Palmer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Norville</ENAMEX>. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norville</ENAMEX> also has served as a substitute for co-anchor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Pauley</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ebersol</ENAMEX> also couldn't be reached to comment. The ``Today'' show is in a battle for the top-rated morning show with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX>'s ``Good Morning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> show is produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>'s entertainment division.
