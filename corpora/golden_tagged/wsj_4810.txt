<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal Corp.</ENAMEX> boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 40% and declared a 2-for-1 stock split, but analysts said the hefty increase in cash payout still leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX>'s yield below other major oil stocks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> said the new quarterly dividend of 35 cents a share will be paid Nov. 10 on a pre-split basis to holders of record Oct. 10. The company previously paid a 25 cent quarterly dividend.
Stock certificates for the stock split will be distributed on or about Nov. 13 to holders of record Oct. 10, the company said.
Analysts have speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX>, sometimes rumored as a takeover candidate, might boost its dividend. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> stock slid in a sinking market for oil issues, falling 37.5 cents a share to close at $54.875 in consolidated trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard J. Stegemeier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX>'s chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the dividend boost ``reflects our strengthened financial position and our confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX>'s future.'' He said the stock split follows a substantial increase in the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> stock over the last several years ``and it is intended to expand the marketability of the stock to a broad range of investors.''
But financial analysts said the move, which at yesterday's closing price will boost the annual dividend yield to about 2.6% from 1.8%, still leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX>'s payout well below market averages and below most big oil companies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Richfield Co.</ENAMEX>, for instance, has a dividend yield of 4.2%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX> has a yield of 4.7% and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> a yield of 5.3%.
``What you're beginning to see is an acknowledgment that, because of the debt issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> has been way behind the eightball,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc D. Cohen</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> ``likely will slowly build up the yield.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> cut its dividend to the 25 cent quarterly rate from 30 cents in 1986, when burgeoning debt taken on following a takeover battle led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr.</ENAMEX> pinched cash flow.
Even before that, the company for many years had a notably low dividend yield. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longtime</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred L. Hartley</ENAMEX> once cracked that shareholders wouldn't know what to do with the extra money if the dividend were increased.
