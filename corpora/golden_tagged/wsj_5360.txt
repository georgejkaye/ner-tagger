<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Boone Pickens Jr.</ENAMEX> said he agreed to buy another 10 million shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito Manufacturing Co.</ENAMEX>, stepping up his campaign for more influence in the Japanese auto-parts maker.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> said the purchase would increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> stake held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boone Co.</ENAMEX>, his merchant-banking firm, to about 42.4 million shares, or about 26% of the shares outstanding, up from 20%. He expects the transaction to be completed in 30 days. Terms weren't disclosed. The shares are being purchased in a private transaction from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azabu Group of Japan</ENAMEX>, which is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitaro Watanabe</ENAMEX>, a wealthy investor with extensive real estate and automobile dealership holdings.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>-based corporate raider said he hasn't any plans to take over the company, ``but we do want to participate in the management of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> and share in its long-term success.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> said the company ``will not succeed in keeping us out.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX>'s largest shareholder, has been jousting with the Japanese company for months. Earlier this week, he asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> to increase its interim dividend.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> said he plans to ask for a special shareholders meeting at which he would again press a request for three board seats. There were reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> has scheduled a special meeting for Nov. 11.
