<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken</ENAMEX> may sell off part of its 90%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram B.V.</ENAMEX> recording-company subsidiary in a public share offer within a few months.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornelius Van der Klugt</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> company is waiting for the right moment to launch a sale and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> will be able to say something more definitive about it within a few months. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram</ENAMEX> is the third-largest recording company in the world.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> spokesman Friday, added that during the past month or so, the company firmed up its intention for a Polygram share offer, but that ``the timing still isn't certain, although it could be within the next few months.''
Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> spokesman nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Klugt</ENAMEX> would say how much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram</ENAMEX> would be up for sale. Analysts tend to expect at least 20% of the record company will be floated and listed on the stockmarket during the next year or so.
