<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</ENAMEX>, the two giants of discount retailing, have plenty in common.
They carry much the same merchandise, offer prices that are pennies apart and operate stores that look almost exactly alike. Even their names are similar.
Yet consumer perceptions of the two chains are anything but the same. In several independent surveys, many shoppers say they view <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> as the industry leader, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart as a laggard.
In a 1987 poll by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based research firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leo J. Shapiro & Associates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> shoppers rated their store significantly higher and said they spent much more money than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart shoppers said they did. Consumers questioned last year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Landor Associates</ENAMEX>, a strategic design consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, gave much higher marks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> in the category of ``esteem.'' And shoppers earlier this year told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mona Doyle</ENAMEX>, a consumer pollster in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, that they were significantly more satisfied with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>.
With so many similarities between the two chains, why do shoppers seem to view them so differently?
Some retailing specialists believe the answer lies in an often-ignored side of the industry. They say that unlike manufacturers, whose success depends more on the quality of their products, retailers can rise or fall on the tiny signals they send consumers in everything from the stores' logos to the width of their aisles.
It might not seem significant that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> employees wear vests, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart employees don't, or that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> bags its merchandise in brown paper sacks, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart uses plastic. But with other things roughly equal, these small differences can make a big difference in consumers' perceptions of what a retailer stands for and the vibes shoppers get in its stores, the specialists say.
``Everything a company does sends a signal about who they are, what they believe and what they want to be,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Farmer</ENAMEX>, a retail consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boca Raton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX> ``One little bad thing can wipe out lots of good things.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart still is bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> in sales -- $27.3 billion to $20.6 billion in the latest fiscal year -- and number of stores -- 2,200 around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, compared with 1,325 for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>, mostly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> edged ahead in profit for the first time in the fiscal year ended in January, with earnings of $837.2 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX>'s $803 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>'s sales also have been growing much faster than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX>'s in recent years.
Of course, in some areas -- such as advertising and quality of apparel sold -- consultants and some consumers give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart higher marks than its rival. In recent years, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart has overcome much of its disadvantage as an older chain through extensive renovation programs. It also has upgraded its customer service and cut prices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart says it is now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>'s equal. ``Our research shows that in markets where we compete, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> doesn't seem to have any competitive advantage,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Wellman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX>'s marketing vice president. ``The bulk of the people who have a choice shop both stores.''
But many retailing executives and consultants consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> the leader in attention to the details that help shape shoppers' attitudes. They say the chain is particularly adept at striking the delicate balance needed to convince customers that its prices are low without making people feel that its stores are too cheap. These same consultants say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart, on the other hand, sometimes risks cheapening its image with tactics that generate quick sales -- such as offering to double manufacturers' coupons or running its ``blue light specials,'' the spur-of-the-moment sales that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart stores announce over their public-address systems and mark with flashing blue lights.
The blue light special ``has all the charm of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P.A.</ENAMEX> announcement in a railroad station,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Peterson</ENAMEX>, a retail design consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hinsdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX> Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart says the specials spark heavy  impulse buying, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peterson</ENAMEX> contends that the ``net result is that it adds to the dreariness'' of shopping at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consultants</ENAMEX> also contrast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>'s simple logo, in white block letters on a brown background, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX>'s bright red and blue store signs. The brown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>'s logo conveys ``a warmer invitation'' to shoppers, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clive Chajet</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lippincott & Margulies Inc.</ENAMEX>, an image consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``It's friendlier and less blatantly commercial.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX>'s red ``K'' grabs shoppers' attention and signals that the store's prices will be low, consultants say. It also helps create a mood that can prompt impulse purchases. But several say the red <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> doesn't work particularly well with the cold turquoise blue letters that spell out the word ``mart.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart logo, though highly recognizable, also conveys the impression that the chain hasn't changed since its early discounting days in the 1960s. At the time, it attracted shoppers by hawking low-priced light bulbs, hangers and other odds and ends, not the more stylish apparel and home goods it also carries today. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart says it has no immediate plans to change its logo, though that could happen at some point in the future.
Subtle differences in store decor also affect how shoppers feel. Visits to competing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> outlets on the west side of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wis.</ENAMEX> -- both representative stores -- show how the little things can add up.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>, the main aisles are wider than those at the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">K</ENAMEX> mart. Fluorescent lighting is recessed into the ceiling, creating a softer impression than the glare from the exposed strips at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart. And the apparel departments are carpeted in a warm, autumnal orange, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX>'s are tiled in off-white.
Together, such features signal to consumers that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> is ``more upscale'' and carries ``a little better-quality'' merchandise than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack D. Fontaine</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dayton Hudson Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Target discount-store unit.
Creating this impression is important in selling apparel, consultants say, because clothing shoppers linger longer and make more emotional choices than those in search of shampoo or household cleaners. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carpeting</ENAMEX> makes the department feel homier, and the padding underfoot can also make tired shoppers more comfortable.
Consultants who have studied the retailers say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> has the edge in customer service, and that difference is also apparent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madison</ENAMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> store, an aggressively friendly grandfather guards the entrance, smiling at babies and striking up conversations with shoppers, while another employee follows customers to their cars to pick up their shopping carts and even stops to pet a puppy. At the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">K</ENAMEX> mart, a young woman working as a greeter stands stoicaly and waits for people to ask her questions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> employees also wear blue vests that make them easier to pick out from a distance than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart employees, identified only by small nameplates. And the vests' subdued blue color reinforces <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>'s image as a friendly, nonthreatening place to shop.
All of which makes a difference with shoppers. Many consumers in focus groups held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo J. Shapiro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">& Associates</ENAMEX> praised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> for making them ``feel more welcome,'' for taking ``time out to treat you like they're glad you're doing business with them'' or ``smiling and saying,'How are you doing?'''
Though consultants regard <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">K</ENAMEX> mart's marketing efforts highly, they say the chain sometimes fails to state its message as clearly as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>. Banners installed earlier this year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart include the vague claim that the chain has ``Very Important Prices.'' ``VIP'' tags appear on its shelves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>'s signs, by contrast, say ``Always the Low Price on the Brands You Trust. Always.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wellman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart vice president, concedes that the VIP program ``has not conveyed the message as succinctly as we wanted to. It's just another message that may or may not be here next year.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart also is trying to improve service, though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wellman</ENAMEX> says the efforts have nothing to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart set up a toll-free phone line for customers to air their concerns. It started awarding prizes for customer service and distributed new employee badges that say ``Committed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customer Care.</ENAMEX>'' It also copied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>'s practice of stationing ``people greeters'' at its doors. Says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wellman</ENAMEX>: ``We're going to have more to say on the subject'' of service.
But what works for one chain doesn't necessarily work for the other. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>, which has always had what it calls ``everyday low prices,'' draws shoppers with only one ad circular a month. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> mart cut back to one ad circular a week from two and started reducing prices to new ``everyday levels.'' Nevertheless, in the first four months of its current fiscal year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K mart</ENAMEX>'s customer count fell about 5% from a year earlier, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Wayne Hood</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>
