<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognos Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottawa</ENAMEX>, a computer software company, said it would post a fiscal second-quarter pretax loss of about 1.5 million Canadian dollars (US$1.3 million) and announced a restructuring of its senior management.
The company said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Csathy</ENAMEX>, its president and chief operating officer since 1986, has resigned ``to pursue other interests.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Potter</ENAMEX>, the company's chief executive officer, has taken on the additional post as president. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Csathy</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognos</ENAMEX> said the C$1.5 million pretax loss for the second quarter ended Aug. 31 didn't include the costs of restructuring management, which included the reassignment of some managers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potter</ENAMEX> estimated the restructuring costs would double the pretax loss for the quarter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cognos</ENAMEX> went into the red in its first quarter, mainly because of a decline in sales. The company estimated its second-quarter sales at C$29 million, up from C$24.4 million a year earlier. Full second-quarter results are expected to be released next Tuesday.
