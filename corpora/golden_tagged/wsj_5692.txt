Your Aug. 16 page-one story concerning the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Plains</ENAMEX> must have caused the ghost of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Prescott Webb</ENAMEX> to nod sadly in understanding and agreement. In his fascinating and scholarly book ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Plains</ENAMEX>,'' he chronicled the fates of the several homestead acts, told how many cattle went up from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> on the big drives from 1867 through 1880, and described agricultural and water-use practices as the open range changed to fenced farms. He lamented what he saw as inevitably in store for that vast region if there was crop farming west of the 98th meridian. What he predicted has come true.
Here in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> we have a situation in which real-estate developers, irrigating farmers and the mines devour water on the apparent conviction that the underground (and our only) supply is limitless. Let's hope they're right. We receive no net recharge to the underground water on which we live, and the hope of the local populace is that a diversion of water called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Arizona</ENAMEX> Project, soon to come to our rescue, will save us all from our profligacy and enable us to continue to pump water for farms and indulge in such ventures as fountains and artificial lakes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interestingly</ENAMEX>, the anti-conservation forces claim that there is no serious water problem, and the economy of the state -- at least of the southern part -- is based upon a constant, almost frantic, drive for population growth. I have a feeling that if Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webb</ENAMEX> were here now he would have no more impact on this situation than he did on the situation he saw so clearly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Plains</ENAMEX> area. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> will tell.
