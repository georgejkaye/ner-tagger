There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad.
After years of mistrust born of Watergate, past misdeeds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>-Contra scandal, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> appear ready -- for now, at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities. If that attitude lasts, it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that hasn't been seen in years.
Over the past week, the president has agreed to keep the committee informed, usually in advance, of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing. That wasn't always the way the Reagan administration handled such matters.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> never fully trusted former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Casey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX> Adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Poindexter</ENAMEX> to honor the ban.
Despite objections by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> who would be independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> director.
In return, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity. It also has removed a ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> didn't get back in the assassination game.
``We've finally been able to convince them that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">{Oliver} North</ENAMEX> don't work here anymore,'' says one administration official.
The new understanding didn't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light. It emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics that followed this month's failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> even disclosed privately that one <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>-era deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> required him to notify the odious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX>, if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life. The president also hinted he might veto this year's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okla.</ENAMEX>) and Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>), for their part, angrily accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for the bungled attempt to topple <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Noriega</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative Republicans who don't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities. Instead, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his aides made it clear they respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s role and felt they could work with the conservative Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and the moderate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> to iron out their differences.
The senators responded in kind. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> happily told reporters that there had been ``a meeting of the minds'' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, and that the committee had given Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> ``a clean slate,'' free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said the relationship has reverted to its pre-Reagan character.
There still are some details to be nailed down. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is reserving the right in ``rare'' instances to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in the dark, asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee doesn't recognize. And a pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled.
Moreover, both sides may face political critics. Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising Congress too much. And they continue anonymously attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster</ENAMEX> for being too accommodating to the committee. At the same time, some congressional liberals will accuse Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> of wimping out, and they will warn that the lawmakers' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> arms sales.
But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities, the country could be entering an era when such hare-brained schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards, while risky but well-planned secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a panicky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will balk.
