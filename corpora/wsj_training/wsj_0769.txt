The surprise resignation yesterday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the British economy.
The U.S. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling's tumble, as market participants switched out of pounds.
The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark, falling below the key 2.90-mark level to 2.8956 marks from 2.9622 marks late Wednesday.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s resignation shocked many analysts, despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>.
Indeed, only hours earlier, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had called Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s economic policies ``sound'' and said she has ``always supported'' him.
``There was a general feeling that we'd seen the worst,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Foley</ENAMEX>, deputy chief economic adviser for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. ``The resignation came as a great surprise.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Beale</ENAMEX>, manager of foreign-exchange operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, added that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s comments reinforced the market's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit's later decline.
``The market was caught totally the wrong way.... Everyone was extremely long on sterling,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beale</ENAMEX> said.
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8400 marks, up from 1.8353 marks late Wednesday, and at 142.10 yen, up from 141.52 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was quoted at $1.5765, sharply down from $1.6145 late Wednesday.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Friday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at 142.02 yen, up from Thursday's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of 141.90 yen.
Few analysts had much good to say about the pound's near-term prospects, despite the fact that most don't anticipate a shift in Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s economic policies.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX> noted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s replacement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX>, the British foreign minister, will take time to establish his credibility and, in the meantime, sterling could trend downward in volatile trade.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> predicted few economic policy changes ahead, commenting that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> shares ``a very similar view of the world'' with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Chandross</ENAMEX>, chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, also noted that the pound's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered United Kingdom economic policies.
Unless Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s resignation leads to a change in British interest-rate policy -- Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check -- or posturing toward full inclusion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX>'s exchange-rate mechanism, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandross</ENAMEX> concluded.
Also announcing his resignation Thursday was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX>, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s economic adviser and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s nemesis.
The pound, which had been trading at about $1.6143 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> prior to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s announcement, sank more than two cents to $1.5930, prompting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> to buy pounds for dollars. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s move, however, only proved a stopgap to the pound's slide and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> intervened for a second time at around $1.5825, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> traders.
Meanwhile, dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session, according to dealers, who noted that Thursday's release of the preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product was something of a nonevent.
U.S. GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in the third quarter. The implicit price deflator, a measure of inflation, was down to a 2.9% annual rate of increase in the quarter from a 4.6% rate of gain in the second quarter.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, the dollar ended lower in dull trading. The market closed prior to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s announcement.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, gold for current delivery rose $3.40 to $372.50 an ounce in heavy trading. The close was the highest since August 3. Estimated volume was five million ounces.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Friday, gold was quoted at $370.85 an ounce.
