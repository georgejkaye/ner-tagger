<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calgene Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gustafson Inc.</ENAMEX> said they plan a joint project to develop biological products to control such plant diseases as aflatoxin, a potent cancer-causing agent.
Under the plan, the companies will use Calgene's patented technology to encapsulate microbes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacillus</ENAMEX> subtilis, a bacterium, to enhance their biological activity against plant diseases.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calgene</ENAMEX>, an agricultural biotechnology concern, said initial work will concentrate on a proprietary strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacillus</ENAMEX> subtilis which has shown promise for controlling aflatoxin. The strain was discovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morinaga & Co.</ENAMEX> and licensed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gustafson</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aflatoxin</ENAMEX> is released by molds during grain and seed storage. The recent appearance of aflatoxin in such foods as corn and peanut butter has sparked public concern and consumer scrutiny of food handling and storage procedures.
