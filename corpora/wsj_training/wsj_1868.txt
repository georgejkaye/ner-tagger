<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John V. Holmes</ENAMEX>, an investment-newsletter publisher, and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies.
As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> was the subject of a page one profile in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> in 1984, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter. In 1986, in another consent agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws. Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX>, that agreement settled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> charges that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> sold unregistered securities and misled investors.
In charges filed last week in federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> alleged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venture Capitalists Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venture Finance Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Ventures Fund Inc.</ENAMEX>, all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, failed repeatedly to file proper documents. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> also charged that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> acted as an officer or director of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Ventures</ENAMEX>, in violation of his previous consent agreement.
``Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions, all of which cost money,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> said.
Two of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX>'s business associates who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venture Capitalists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly Ann Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Byrum</ENAMEX>, also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer, director or investment adviser of any mutual fund, unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrum</ENAMEX> and Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. In consenting to the injunctions, none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations.
