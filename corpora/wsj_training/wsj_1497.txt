While welcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Mcinnes</ENAMEX>'s Sept. 18 letter offering corrections to your ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World-Wide Tax Revolution</ENAMEX>'' table (editorial page, Aug. 29), I am surprised that he neglected other errors that, for some of us, strike close to home.
As a Channel Islander, I was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of ``86 countries with an income tax.'' Despite a history of heated local debate on the topic, my passport clearly reads ``British citizen.'' Whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcinnes</ENAMEX>'s oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander's benign neglect is a question my fellow Channel Islanders (and friends on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isle</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Man</ENAMEX>) will continue to ponder.
