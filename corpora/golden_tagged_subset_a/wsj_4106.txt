Protracted negotiations on three municipal bond issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> totaling $368.4 million have produced a settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX>, according to persons involved in the matter.
Under the accord, these people said, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> is recovering $6.6 million and is agreeing in return not to tax bondholders. The three bond issues were sold in early 1985 as tax-exempt securities by authorities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chandler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Tucson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Mirage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> this year said the bonds weren't tax exempt.
``The deal is closed and the money is supposed to be paid'' today, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Ducomb</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chandler Industrial Development Authority</ENAMEX>. He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chandler City Council</ENAMEX> and the authority approved the settlement and that he signed settlement documents on behalf of the authority. He said he's ``delighted'' the so-called closing agreement is finally in hand.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Stoops</ENAMEX>, a lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Mirage</ENAMEX>, said he has approved the settlement on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Mirage</ENAMEX>. He said he understands the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> will get its money today. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Representatives</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Tucson</ENAMEX> authority, which sold the largest of the three bond issues, $178.4 million, couldn't be reached for comment. But Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ducomb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoops</ENAMEX> said all three authorities are included in the package settlement.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the matter, citing a prohibition against discussing taxpayer-related questions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> notified the authorities in letters dated March 29, 1989, that the bond transactions violated tax rules designed to prevent arbitrage abuses in municipal bonds. Arbitrage is earned by investing bond proceeds in higher-yielding instruments.
The bonds were sold for housing projects that weren't built. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> concluded the projects weren't realistic in the first place. They produced about $20 million in arbitrage profits.
The three companion bond issues were underwritten by Birr, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson & Co.</ENAMEX>, which went out of business last year and isn't part of the settlement.
According to Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ducomb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stoops</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> agreed not to take any further action against participants in the settlements. A tax interpretation in a new congressional report holds that municipal bonds are covered by federal tax penalties for promoting abusive tax shelters.
