<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus Corp.</ENAMEX> said the French government gave it approval to market its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proleukin</ENAMEX> interleukin-2 anti-cancer drug as a treatment for kidney cancer.
The move is a shot in the arm for the biotechnology concern, which has had heavy losses while developing the drug and other products. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> is the fourth and largest European Community country to approve the marketing of the experimental drug, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IL</ENAMEX>-2. The other countries are <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX> said it expects to begin distributing the drug in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> within the next several weeks, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX> and a committee of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> country officials negotiate a price for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IL</ENAMEX>-2. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX> declined to discuss how much it hopes to charge for the drug. It said an estimated 9,400 people are treated for kidney cancer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> each year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cetus</ENAMEX> expects the remaining eight EC countries to approve marketing of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IL</ENAMEX>-2 within the next six months. The company applied for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval in November and expects to receive it in the first half of 1990.
