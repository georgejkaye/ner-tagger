<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp Inc.</ENAMEX> said it intends to spin off most of the computer-products businesses acquired last year in its $370 million purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xidex Corp.</ENAMEX>
After struggling for months to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xidex</ENAMEX>'s magnetics businesses around, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX>'s management said it would transfer its floppy disk and rigid oxide disk operations, as well as some data products operations, to a subsidiary to be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dysan Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX> would retain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xidex</ENAMEX>'s micrographics businesses. The spinoff, in the form of a dividend to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX> shareholders, is expected to occur by next spring.
``Separating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anacomp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dysan</ENAMEX> will enable the magnetics businesses, which have made tremendous strides in the last nine months, to focus on continuing their improvements in operating results,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Ferrero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer. A company spokeswoman said the magnetics businesses are now profitable.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX> also announced a refinancing plan intended to reduce the cost of long-term debt largely associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xidex</ENAMEX> acquisition. It said its banks have agreed to increase credit lines to $375 million from $275 million. The plan would make Dysan financially independent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX> said. The company also filed a registration statement for $225 million of senior subordinated notes.
As part of the anticipated spinoff, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX> shareholders would receive all the common stock of Dysan while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX> would retain preferred stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anacomp</ENAMEX> also would have board representation and would provide Dysan with administrative services, it said.
