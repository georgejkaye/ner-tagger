Weary of the Third World foibles and capital needs of big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> banks? The investors' antidote may have arrived: Japanese bank stocks.
This week, for the first time, investors will be able to trade American depositary receipts in one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s leviathan banks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> Other Japanese banks, many of which have been listing their shares on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">European</ENAMEX> stock exchanges in the past year, are expected to follow suit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> soon. An ADR represents a security that remains in a foreign country.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> listing is the first by a Japanese company since 1983. The fourth-largest and one of the most conservative of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s banks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> is so financially sound it puts most U.S. banks to shame. In the Form 20-F the bank had to file with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank</ENAMEX> became the first Japanese bank to explain its accounts in U.S. terms, but analysts said the filing contained no real surprises.
With total assets of 46.61 trillion yen ($318 billion), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank</ENAMEX> is two-thirds bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s biggest bank, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>. Moreover, like most Japanese banks, it owns a huge portfolio of Japanese stocks, mainly in the circle of so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mistsubishi</ENAMEX> group companies it lends to; its unrealized securities gains amount to 4.05 trillion yen.
Even without that sum, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX>'s capital-to-assets ratio -- a rough measure of how much cash a bank keeps on hand for every loan it makes -- stands at more than 10%. That means the bank already clears the 8% hurdle that the world's central bankers have agreed to impose globally starting in 1992. As a result, analysts say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> isn't likely to be making big capital demands on its stockholders, as some U.S. banks will.
Nor are any ugly clouds looming on the horizon. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX>'s exposure to the debt-burdened developing world amounts to 0.84% of total assets. That figure is hardly comparable to the profit-staggering levels many U.S. banks endure. Besides, the establishment of new loan-loss reserves in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is tightly controlled by the powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX>, which has kept such reserves to 15% of banks' exposure and isn't likely to significantly raise them.
With such strengths, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank</ENAMEX> figured it was time to tap foreign investors, who now own just 1.5% of the bank's 2.55 billion shares. ``We're in an era where Japanese can drive Cadillacs, wear Celine ties and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin Reed</ENAMEX> suits,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hisaya Nara</ENAMEX>, the bank's deputy president. ``Investors should have choices, too.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nara</ENAMEX> notes that even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> has had an office in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> almost constantly since 1920, and since 1984 has owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of California</ENAMEX>, it recently has granted its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American</ENAMEX> subsidiary wide new autonomy to make loans and raise funds. By listing its Adrs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, he says, the bank hopes it can raise its profile among U.S. corporate borrowers and institutional lenders. Besides, he adds: ``We think we should make an attractive investment.''
Analysts generally agree. In a report comparing the bank's 20-F filing with its annual report, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX>' banking analysts praise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mistsubishi</ENAMEX>'s financial conservatism and predict its stock will outperform the broad-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> index over the next six to 12 months. That wouldn't be much of an aberration, though; unlike bank stocks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, the Japanese financial sector has routinely outpaced the market as a whole during the past two years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s closely regulated banking environment and booming economy have helped. Most interest rate margins in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> remain fixed and, while floating-rate loans now make up more than 50% of loans made in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, banks have a vast, cheap deposit rate thanks to a rigid savings ethic and a national savings-deposit rate of only 0.38%.
``Investors have finally come around to the realization that the cheap source of deposits and rapid growth is showing up in profits,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Brian Waterhouse</ENAMEX>, a banking analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Capel.</ENAMEX> In the year ended March 31, 1989, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX>'s net income shot up 50.6% to 60.5 billion yen.
The bank can probably maintain its earnings stream, despite the likelihood of extensive deregulation in the coming decade. ``It's pretty much guaranteed,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Zielinski</ENAMEX>, a banking analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jardine Fleming Securities.</ENAMEX> ``They can just sell some of their securities holdings.'' He notes that the constant growth of profits at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank</ENAMEX> has helped the bank's share price to grow 1,631 times since
Still, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zielinski</ENAMEX> cautions that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX>'s high price -- it stands at more than 40 times prospective per-share earnings -- doesn't offer the spectacular gains other financial stocks might. ``With some cheap U.S. banking stocks, you could get a great recovery story,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zielinski</ENAMEX> says. Or he suggests cross-border investors buy stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, a company that's closely aligned with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank</ENAMEX> but carries a price-earnings ratio of closer to 30. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank</ENAMEX> may be hard to justify if you're a value-oriented investor,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zielinski</ENAMEX> says. But, he adds: ``You can be sure it will gain as long as earnings keep going up.
