<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaw Cellular Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> must extend its offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> because it has ``not yet announced committed financing sufficient to complete'' the bid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> rules, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX> is required to keep its offer for the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern open for at least five business days after the announcement of the financing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX>'s offer is scheduled to expire tomorrow.
Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaw</ENAMEX> said it obtained ``firm'' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its bid to control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN Broadcasting.</ENAMEX> The banks jointly committed $1.2 billion of financing, subject to certain conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX> said.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaw</ENAMEX> said the company was ``moving forward with our financing.'' He added that ``hopefully <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> will conduct a fair auction.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX> wants to buy 22 million shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> for $125 each, or $2.75 billion, which would result in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mccaw</ENAMEX>'s owning 50.3% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX>. The offer is in limbo, however, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth Corp.</ENAMEX>
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> rose 50 cents, to $109.25.
