The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> rejected a constitutional amendment that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> sought to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> flag from desecration.
The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution.
The vote, in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s position, was a victory for Democratic leaders, who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights. ``We can support the American flag without changing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Constitution</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>.
In order to defuse pressure for an amendment, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>) had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature, because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately.
In June, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> threw out the conviction of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration, saying he was ``engaging in political expression'' that is protected by the First Amendment.
