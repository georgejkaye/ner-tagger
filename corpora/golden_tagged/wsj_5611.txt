<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooper Cos.</ENAMEX> and a group of dissident shareholders agreed to drop lawsuits they had filed against each other earlier this year.
The shareholders, who control 7.18% of the company's stock, had sued the company and seven directors for allegedly ``disseminating false and misleading proxy materials'' to holders. The suit, filed Aug. 1 in a federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, claimed that the directors sought to ensure their re-election by not disclosing the latest financial information about the contact-lens company.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, company, in turn, sued the shareholders' group for alleged securities-law violations in its solicitation of proxies for a dissident slate of directors.
Attorneys for the two sides said the agreement to drop the suits didn't involve any settlement by the parties. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melvin A. Brosterman</ENAMEX>, an attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooper</ENAMEX>, said the accord stemmed from a board decision to accept the nomination as a director of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses Marx</ENAMEX>, a member of the shareholders' group. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg A. Danilow</ENAMEX>, an attorney for the shareholders' group, said the suits weren't dropped in return for the nomination of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marx</ENAMEX>, who controls 6% of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cooper</ENAMEX>'s stock.
The company's annual meeting, twice postponed, is scheduled for Sept. 27.
