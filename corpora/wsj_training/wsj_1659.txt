The television units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week, industry executives say.
Although such a venture wouldn't match the ``fourth network'' created by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> may have similar ambitions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX>, which also owns six TV stations, provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Domestic TV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> TV formed a joint venture last month, named Premier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Advertiser Sales</ENAMEX>, to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies, such as ``Star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trek</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Next Generation</ENAMEX>,'' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> in Charge'' and ``Friday the 13th: the Series.''
A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> said the company doesn't comment on speculation. Calls to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelly Schwab</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> TV, weren't returned.
The two companies, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX>, already have their own TV stations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWOR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> last month agreed to purchase a 79% stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVX Broadcast Group</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> in a deal valued at $140 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVX</ENAMEX> owns five stations, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTXF</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fox</ENAMEX> affiliate, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>.
One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities. Currently, Fox supplies programs on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturdays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sundays</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mondays</ENAMEX>, although the company plans to expand to other weeknights.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Kellner</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Broadcasting</ENAMEX>, said, ``We believe the partnership of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX>, its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow.''
Another Fox official, who declined to be identified, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> wasn't pleased by the possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> venture into prime-time programming. ``To make the venture work, they would need Fox affiliates,'' he said. ``We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations,'' he said, adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> doesn't ``appreciate'' another company attempting to usurp its station lineup.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> said it plans to offer its stations movies, theatrical and made-for-TV ventures, probably on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wednesdays</ENAMEX>, sometime next year. It is also planning another night of original series.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX>, according to the broadcasting executive, plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA for Wednesdays</ENAMEX> and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays.
The executive said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> have also held discussions with Chris-Craft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industries</ENAMEX>' broadcasting unit, which owns five independent stations in cities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore</ENAMEX>. A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks.
``I think it's to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX>'s advantage to be associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> venture,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Conway</ENAMEX>, station manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WTXF</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TVX</ENAMEX> station that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> affiliate. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conway</ENAMEX> said the Fox shows appearing on nights when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> shows wouldn't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Fisher</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KTXL</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fox</ENAMEX> affiliate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, said, ``The real question is whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> offering is practical. It isn't.... Why would I consider giving up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX>, a proven commodity,'' for an unknown venture? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX> attracts a young audience with shows such as ``Married... With Children,'' its most successful series.
