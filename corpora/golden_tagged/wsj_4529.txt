<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mountaineer Bankshares</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Virginia Inc.</ENAMEX> said that a larger-than-expected loan-loss provision for the third quarter will result in a substantial reduction in net income and that an additional loan-loss provision will hurt fourth-quarter net.
