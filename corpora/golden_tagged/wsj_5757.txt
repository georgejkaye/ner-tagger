<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to be acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> for stock valued at $18.75 a share, or about $730 million, passing up a sweetened, eleventh-hour bid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian Bancorp</ENAMEX>.
The acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> would make Corestates the third largest banking operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, with about $23 billion in assets and about 280 branches in southeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>. It would also prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX>, an aggressive and rapidly growing rival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX>, from gaining a much bigger share of the lucrative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>-area market.
In accepting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> offer early Monday morning after a weekend marathon of negotiations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> left on the table a bid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> valued at about $20.85 a share, based on Friday's closing stock prices. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s board was swayed by terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> offer and promises that branch offices and operations could be consolidated without massive layoffs among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s staff.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie Butler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s vice chairman, said his company's board ``believes it accepted the offer which provides the best long-term value for our customers, employees, shareholders and community.''
Under the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> shareholders would receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> stock in a tax-free exchange valued at $18.75 for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> share. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> shareholders are guaranteed of receiving $18.75 a share in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> stock as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX>' share price rises or falls no more than 6% from Thursday's close of $49.50 a share.
Wall Street reacted quickly when the agreement was announced yesterday morning. In over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> shares fell $2.125 to close at $47.50, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> shares rose $1.125 to close at $23.50. In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> shares also rose, closing at $16.75, up $1.50.
Over the weekend, in an effort to respond to deadlines imposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> bid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> raised its initial offer of $18 a share to about $20.85 a share. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> officials said the sweetened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> bid was difficult to evaluate because it offered the bank's shareholders a fixed number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> shares to be exchanged for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> holdings. Thus the final purchase price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> offer could fluctuate if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX>'s stock price were to rise or fall before the merger could be completed. ``The risk would be entirely borne by our shareholders,'' explained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the specifics of its bid. A spokesperson said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Reading</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, bank had signed a confidentiality agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> pledging not to disclose details of their negotiations.
People familiar with the negotiations said some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> representatives feel betrayed by the outcome because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX>'s final bid was higher, although not guaranteed, and because it had made the first bid. ``It's as if they've been kicked below the belt,'' said a person who followed the negotiation process. Others suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s choice was influenced by Corestates being based, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>.
The merger agreement is subject to approval by regulators and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> shareholders. To carry out its transaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> will have to extricate itself from a 1986 merger agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Midland Banks Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. Marine <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX> had offered $15 a share. That combination was supposed to be completed after March
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> will pay $45 million in cash to buy back warrants held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Midland</ENAMEX> that would have given it a 24.9% voting stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> had offered Marine Midland $30 million for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> stake. To terminate its prior agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Midland</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> will receive $22.5 million. ``We're splitting the $45 million in effect,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Midland</ENAMEX> spokesman.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> emerged as a suitor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> only after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> put the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> bank in play. In an interview, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrence A. Larsen</ENAMEX> said he had been watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> ``for some time,'' although he hadn't thought of making an offer until recently because he believed both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Midland</ENAMEX> were content with their merger plans.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> said the acquisition would result in a per-share earnings dilution for the combined company of about 7% to $5.13 a share, based on analysts' forecasts for 1990 and assuming 10% annual earnings growth. Even so, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> believes it can offset the dilution by consolidating operations and cutting some expenses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> predicted that in the first 24 months after the merger is completed it could realize expense savings of about $89 million, with nearly half of that amount coming from back-office and systems consolidation. Savings of about $57 million would be needed to offset the dilution in the first year of the merger.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> is ``one of the few major banks that actually comes through on what it promises,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Hanley</ENAMEX>, a securities analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers.</ENAMEX> He noted that the bank holding company has achieved substantial economies of scale in previous acquisitions.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larsen</ENAMEX> plans to dispose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s $485 million portfolio of loans to lesser developing countries as quickly as possible, but additional reserves of about $150 million might be needed to liquidate it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> already has set aside about $145.5 million of reserves to cover this portfolio.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> will be aggressive in cutting costs and eliminating overlapping operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larsen</ENAMEX> said the process wouldn't entail massive layoffs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> employees. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larsen</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> is seeing enough growth in its basic businesses to allow it to use the additional staff.
A similar promise was made when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamilton Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, in 1983. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates</ENAMEX> moved many administrative operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del.</ENAMEX>, and eventually eliminated 265 jobs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX> area.
The issue of layoffs was a big concern for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> in its negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meridian</ENAMEX> ``didn't say that there would be layoffs specifically. But with the cost-savings that would have to be achieved to offset the dilution, there's no question that there would be layoffs,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George A. Butler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>'s chairman.
