Investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.</ENAMEX> still appear worried about the publishing giant's long-term prospects, despite the $1.1 billion the company will receive from the sale of its six theme parks.
The company's stock plunged $4.125 a share Friday in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, closing at $12.125. The sell-off came 24 hours after the company announced it would sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX> and other theme parks to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser Busch Cos.</ENAMEX>
The $1.1 billion price tag was ``disappointing,'' according to one institutional investor. In June, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX> disclosed its plan to sell the parks, many analysts suggested the assets would bring at least $1.5 billion.
The lower-than-expected sale price, analysts said, likely will force Harcourt to sell other assets, particularly its insurance business, to further reduce its debt load.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX> ``bought time'' with the theme-park sale, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Boksen</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raymond James & Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Petersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX> But ``I think they'll ultimately have to sell the insurance company.''
In an interview after the sale announcement Thursday, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Berardi</ENAMEX>, senior vice president and treasurer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX>, said the company's insurance business is profitable and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX> has no plans to sell it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX> said Thursday that it would use $930 million of initial net proceeds from the theme-park sale to reduce its $1.12 billion in long-term bank debt. But the company still owes about $1.6 billion of junk-bond debt, which carries an interest rate of about 14%. The heavy debt load stems from 1987, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX> fended off a hostile takeover bid by British publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maxwell</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Jovanovich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX>'s chairman, engineered a $2.9 billion recapitalization by borrowing more than $2 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt</ENAMEX> officials didn't return phone calls Friday. But a person close to the company said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harcourt</ENAMEX> is ``comfortable'' with the high-yield debt. The company, he said, has good cash flow from its publishing and insurance operations.
For Anheuser-Busch, the theme-park pact carries a risk to its credit ratings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service</ENAMEX> said Friday that it is considering whether to downgrade about $1.76 billion of the brewer's long-term debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX>'s purchase of the six parks would increase its debt and interest expense, the rating agency said.
The ratings under review include the double-A-3 rating on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX>'s Eurobonds, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Euromarket</ENAMEX> notes, sinking-fund debentures, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> dollar notes, medium-term notes and industrial development revenue bonds.
