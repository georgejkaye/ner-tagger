A federal judge ruled that a former official of collapsed carpet-cleaning company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZZZZ Best Co.</ENAMEX> must pay a $899,443 penalty on civil insider-trading charges filed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry N. Polevoi</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty last year to a four-count indictment that included an insider-trading charge, and he is now in federal prison. A similar ruling in the civil insider-trading case was issued last month against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polevoi</ENAMEX>'s twin brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack N. Polevoi</ENAMEX>, a former ZZZZ Best vice president who is also serving time in prison.
Of the $899,443 payment, $224,860.75 involves repayment of money Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polevoi</ENAMEX> earned from shorting ZZZZ Best stock when he knew that the company was in financial difficulties and that its chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Minkow</ENAMEX>, was thinking of resigning. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minkow</ENAMEX> was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $26 million in restitution for his role in the ZZZZ Best fraud. The rest of the fine against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polevoi</ENAMEX> is a triple penalty to be paid to the government.
