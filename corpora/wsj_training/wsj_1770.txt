<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Holding Corp.</ENAMEX> said it requested and received the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John A. Franco</ENAMEX>, its vice chairman, as an officer and a director of the life insurance holding company.
The company said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> developed a plan to establish a business that might be competitive with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Holding Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accumulation and Investment Group</ENAMEX>, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX> headed. The group temporarily will report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irving W. Bailey II</ENAMEX>, chairman, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Holding.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franco</ENAMEX>, 47 years old, said in a telephone interview that he has been considering and discussing a number of possible business ventures, but that ``nothing is at a mature stage.'' He said he ``didn't argue with'' the company's decision to seek his resignation because contemplating outside business ventures can distract an executive from performing his best ``at the job he is paid to do.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin H. Ruby</ENAMEX>, a managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Holding</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accumulation and Investment Group</ENAMEX>, also resigned to pursue other business interests, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Holding</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruby</ENAMEX>, 39, said that he had ``an amicable parting'' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Holding</ENAMEX> and that he has ``a number of ventures in the financial-services area'' under consideration. He said that his resignation was a mutual decision with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Holding</ENAMEX> management, but that he wasn't actually asked to resign.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accumulation and Investment Group</ENAMEX> is responsible for the investment operations of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Holding</ENAMEX>'s insurance businesses and markets guaranteed investment contracts to bank trust departments and other institutions. It also sells single-premium annuities to individuals.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bailey</ENAMEX> said he expects to name a new group president to head that operation following the Nov. 8 board meeting.
