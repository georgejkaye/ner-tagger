<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automatic Data Processing Inc.</ENAMEX> plans to redeem on Nov. 16 its $150 million of 6.5% convertible subordinated debentures due March 1, 2011.
The computing-services concern will pay $1,059.04 for each $1,000 face amount of debt. The conversion price for the debentures is $41.725 a share. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automatic Data</ENAMEX> closed at $46.50 a share, down $2.25.
If all the debt is converted to common, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automatic Data</ENAMEX> will issue about 3.6 million shares; last Monday, the company had nearly 73 million shares outstanding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automatic Data</ENAMEX> is redeeming the bonds because the after-tax cost of the interest on the bonds is higher than the dividend yield on the common, a spokesman said.
