(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on the idea of the decimal system for currency, thus saving Americans the headaches of pounds, shillings and pence. But he struck out with the decimal system of metric weights and measures the French had invented. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> opted for the inches, feet and yards the colonists had brought with them.
Americans didn't dislike metrics; they simply ignored them. Scientists felt differently. In 1807, the Swiss mathematician who headed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S. Coast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geodetic Survey</ENAMEX> made an ``iron meter'' that he had brought from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> the standard of measure. By the end of the century scientists had embraced the system.
Businessmen took their cue from the engineers. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> finally passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1975, industry was far ahead. Because the law made compliance voluntary, it inspired little more than jokes. (The press had a field day with questions about what would happen to ``six-footer,'' ``yardstick'' and ``inchworm.'')
Today, though the public is barely aware, much of U.S. industry, particularly companies manufacturing or selling overseas, have made metrics routine. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>, for example, uses metric terms for its automobile bodies and power trains. (In auto advertising, however, items such as wheelbases are still described in inches.) Farm-machine makers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deere</ENAMEX> work in the metric system. The liquor industry went metric 10 years ago.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has led the charge, particularly as military alliances spread world-wide. New weapons systems will be around until the next century, notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tascher</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>'s metric coordinator.
Still, like the auto makers, when dealing with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everyman</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> sticks to the tried and true. Soldiers and sailors are still measured in inches and pounds.
