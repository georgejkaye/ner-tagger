In a weekend meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX> between Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and Soviet Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> proposed dropping its demand that progress toward achieving a strategic-arms reduction treaty be linked to separate talks involving space-based weapons. The two nations also said there would be a summit between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> in the late spring or early summer, and reached agreement or made progress on other issues, including verification of underground nuclear testing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> prepared to address the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> today. He is expected to offer a proposal for a chemical-weapons ban and call for cooperation against drugs.
A bloc in the Soviet legislature adopted a platform that calls for ownership of private property, prices set by market conditions and television free of Kremlin control.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> has weakened plans for greater autonomy for the 15 Soviet republics as violence and nationalist unrest continued.

Churches in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, appealed for donations of food and clothing as victims of Hurricane Hugo remained without electricity.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambodia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hun Sen</ENAMEX> urged Asian and Western nations to end arms shipments to anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phnom Penh</ENAMEX> guerrillas once <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> completes its troop pullout tomorrow.

A cease-fire in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> appeared to be holding as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beirut</ENAMEX>'s airport reopened and a cargo ship sailed unscathed into a Christian port. Despite sporadic shellfire, a committee composed of officials from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>'s warring factions met with the Arab League to discuss implementing a peace plan.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>'s 4,600 judges threatened to strike unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bogota</ENAMEX> government provides them with better protection.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Philip</ENAMEX> condemned the ``senseless'' killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in a bombing Friday in the town of Deal, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">southeast England</ENAMEX>.

Underground Arab leaders criticized Egyptian proposals for peace talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health Organization</ENAMEX> reported that one of every five human beings, about one billion people, are suffering from disease, poor health or malnourishment.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haiti</ENAMEX>'s military regime announced that general elections would be held in October 1990 for the transfer of power to a civilian president.

The political scientist was ousted in a coup five months later.
