Wall Street is just about ready to line the bird cage with paper stocks.
For three years, a healthy economy and the export-boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels. As the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for pulp, a raw material used in all sorts of paper, to $830 a metric ton this past spring from $380 a ton at the start of 1986.
But now the companies are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply. Third-quarter profits fell at several companies.
``Put your money in a good utility or bank stock, not a paper company,'' advises <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Adler</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX>.
Other analysts are nearly as pessimistic. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Palmero</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX> expects a 30% decline in earnings between now and 1991 for ``commodity-oriented'' paper companies, which account for the majority of the industry. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Schneider</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duff & Phelps</ENAMEX> sees paper-company stock prices falling 10% to 15% in 1990, perhaps 25% if there's a recession.
Paper companies concede that business has been off recently. But they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions. Generally they maintain that, barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies, the industry isn't headed for a prolonged slump. ``It won't be an earthshaking drop,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> spokesman says.
Last week Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adler</ENAMEX> lowered his rating from hold to ``avoid'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boise Cascade</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champion International</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Northern Nekoosa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Paper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oppenheimer</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmero</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, is steering clear of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaylord Container</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Container</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Paper Board</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schneider</ENAMEX> is cool to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abitibi</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Ross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> would avoid Union Camp.
The companies in question believe the analysts are too pessimistic. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Northern Nekoosa</ENAMEX> said, ``The odds of the dire predictions about us being right are  small.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Paper</ENAMEX> emphasizes that it is better positioned than most companies for the coming overcapacity because its individual mills can make more than one grade of paper.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boise-Cascade</ENAMEX> spokesman referred to a speech by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fery</ENAMEX>, in which he said that markets generally are stable, although some risk of further price deterioration exists.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Container</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Stone</ENAMEX> said that, unlike for some other paper products, demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX>'s principal commodity, unbleached containerboard, remains strong. He expects the price for that product to rise even more next year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaylord Container</ENAMEX> said analysts are skeptical of it because it's carrying a lot of debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champion International</ENAMEX> said, ``We've gotten our costs down and we're better positioned for any cyclical downturn than we've ever been.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Pacific</ENAMEX> said a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong wood-products business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Paper Board</ENAMEX> said, ``We're not as exposed as the popular perception of us.'' The company explained that its main product, bleached paperboard, which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes, historically doesn't have sharp price swings.
Because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> says he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only 5% to 10%. A company such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Paper Board</ENAMEX> may be overly discounted and looks ``tempting'' to him, he says, though he isn't yet recommending the shares.
Wall Street isn't avoiding everything connected with paper. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Palmero</ENAMEX> recommends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple-Inland</ENAMEX>, explaining that it is ``virtually the sole major paper company not undergoing a major capacity expansion,'' and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially next year.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple-Inland</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company expects record earnings in 1989, and ``we're still pretty bullish'' on 1990.
The analysts say their gloomy forecasts have a flip side. Some take a warm view of consumer-oriented paper companies, which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices. Estimates on how much pulp prices will fall next year currently run between $150 and $250 a metric ton.
Analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scott Paper</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kimberly-Clark</ENAMEX>. A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> says that assuming the price of pulp continues to soften, ``We should do well.
