<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>'s state-owned airline, joined the wave of global airline alliances and signed a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with archrival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scandinavian Airlines System</ENAMEX>.
Under the accord, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnair</ENAMEX> agreed to coordinate flights, marketing and other functions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>, the 50%-state-owned airline of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>. The pact also calls for coordination between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finnair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s national carrier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swissair</ENAMEX>, with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> entered a similar alliance last month.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> said they plan to swap stakes in each other. Neither disclosed details pending board meetings next month. Officials hinted, however, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> would take a stake of at least 6% in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finnair</ENAMEX>, valued at about $40 million at current market prices. Finnair would receive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> shares valued at the same amount, officials said.
