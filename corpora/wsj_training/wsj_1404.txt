<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe AG</ENAMEX>'s chairman said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to repel a raider.
Amid heavy buying of shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>'s largest insurer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Lippens</ENAMEX> also warned in an interview that a white knight, in buying out a raider, could leave speculators with big losses on their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> stock. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has nearly doubled, giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> a market value of about 105 billion Belgian francs ($2.7 billion).
The most likely white knight would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe Generale</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belgique S.A.</ENAMEX>, which already owns 18% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> and which itself is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Financiere de Suez</ENAMEX>, the acquisitive French financial conglomerate. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippens</ENAMEX> said a rescue also could involve Asahi <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutual Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, which owns 5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> is hardly alone in its anxiety. A rambunctious shake-up is quickly reshaping <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s once-stately insurance business. Worried by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services, starting in mid-1990, insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, insurers are flirting with banks. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suez</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi Assurances S.A.</ENAMEX> both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suez</ENAMEX> last month acquired control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Victoire</ENAMEX>, the sixth-largest European insurance company, after a takeover battle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrielle</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippens</ENAMEX> said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid-September. But he estimated that a raider would have been able to amass no more than 4% of the shares in recent months.
Aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippens</ENAMEX> has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders -- among them, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union des Assurances</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suez</ENAMEX>, all based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. They have all ``very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>,'' he said.
Any raider would find it hard to crack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>'s battlements. A ``syndicate'' of shareholders holds just under 50% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lippens</ENAMEX> said, and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> shares.
Aside from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Generale de Belgique</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asahi</ENAMEX>, the syndicate includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> savings bank, and various family interests.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Generale</ENAMEX> spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AG</ENAMEX> should a raider seek control. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asahi</ENAMEX> officials couldn't be reached for comment.
Even without bid talk, this year's surge in prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> real estate has excited interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AG</ENAMEX>. The company says those holdings constitute the third-biggest real-estate portfolio in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>.
