<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka Group</ENAMEX>, a fast-growing West German financial services firm, has recruited an imposing array of international allies to better compete against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s big banks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s shrinking financial market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Munich</ENAMEX> and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s few finance firms not affiliated with a bank, last week signed accords ceding small equity stakes in the group to six foreign financial firms, each to form the basis of mutual market access.
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albrecht Matuschka</ENAMEX>, the feisty aristocrat who founded the group 20 years ago, and the firm's 32 other stockholding partners issued new capital to reduce their combined stake in the private firm to 75%. The remaining 25% was then parceled out to the six outside companies, although no single stake exceeded 5%.
Said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matuschka</ENAMEX> in an interview, ``this gives us tremendous firepower while also maintaining our independence; something very rare in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>.''
The roster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX>'s new stockholders explains how:
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura International PLC</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities Co.</ENAMEX>, a huge financial services firm. The Japanese securities house already has a 25.1% interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAT Main Anlage Trust G.m.b. H.</ENAMEX> investment unit, and links Matuschka to Japanese companies seeking financial services in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Capital</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX> is to work on corporate acquisitions in German-speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX> also is in talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody International</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Financial Services</ENAMEX>, for cooperation in trans-Atlantic acquisitions.
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suez International S.A.</ENAMEX>, a unit of Compagnie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Financiere de Suez</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>., with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX> already has joined in a joint venture for German-French mergers and acquisitions and investment trusts.
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charterhouse Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, through the merchant bank's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perchdale Ltd.</ENAMEX> subsidiary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charterhouse</ENAMEX>, which in turn is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, would be helpful in gaining Matuschka a beachhead in U.K. corporate finance markets.
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willowbridge Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an affiliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Botts & Co.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, a specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> investment and corporate finance firm in association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allen & Co.</ENAMEX> of the
-- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akros International Holding S.A.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akros Finanziaria S.p. A of Italy</ENAMEX>, a leading Italian investment firm with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX> already jointly markets investments to Italian investors. Both also are cooperating in German-Italian mergers and acquisitions.s.
The financial details behind the strategic alliances weren't disclosed, keeping in line with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX>'s secretive policies. Past inquiries regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matuschka</ENAMEX>'s fee income or the sums held in its trusts were similarly greeted by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matuschka</ENAMEX>'s stock reply of ``no figures.''
The strategic alliances help disarm the one often-heard criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka Group</ENAMEX>, which has only 400 employees: that it doesn't have the financial resources, the manpower or the global connections to be anything more than a niche player in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s investment and corporate finance markets. The transactions also give Matuschka insurance against getting boxed out and eventually swallowed up as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s financial industry accelerates preparations for an integrated financial market after 1992.
``We thought we had better to position ourselves with some strong friends because of the megalomania going on elsewhere,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matuschka</ENAMEX>, a titled count whose lineage reaches back to the early <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle Ages</ENAMEX>.
His reference is clear. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s big banks, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank AG</ENAMEX>, have been aggressively acquiring smaller banks and financial services firms and forging cooperation pacts with others. Several have set up new insurance arms and home financing units to blanket the markets with financial supermarkets.
Both a careful strategist and an unabashed critic of the big banks, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matuschka</ENAMEX> has emerged as a maverick in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s clubby financial sector with extensive contacts to middle-sized companies, the bedrock of German industry.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matuschka</ENAMEX> was an excellent window for us. There aren't many private, independent firms like it in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Pilgrim</ENAMEX>, a director in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charterhouse</ENAMEX>'s corporate finance division, which had been looking to expand its development capital operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>. ``They also have professional and enthusiastic people from the top on down,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pilgrim</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matuschka</ENAMEX>, who is 45 years old, began his investment company in a back alley office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Munich</ENAMEX> in 1970. Banking on his aristocratic title and his family's links with wealthy society, he built up his TRV investment management firm piece-by-piece in the shadow of an established West German financial industry dominated by the big ``universal'' banks. They are so termed because of their legally uninhibited activities covering retail and commercial banking, securities and corporate finance and lately including management consulting and insurance.
