<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stan West Mining Corp.</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George F. Warnock</ENAMEX> resigned as the company abandoned a plan to recapitalize.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan West</ENAMEX> said it decided against going ahead with the plan for a private placement of convertible debentures because of the continued weakness in gold prices. As a result, the company's principal secured creditor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders Finance Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, will assume ownership of the company's only mine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccabe Mine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>, by means of a trustee's sale.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William C. Jones</ENAMEX>, general counsel for the company, said that in transfering ownership of the mine, the company hopes to avoid filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX>'s resignation was related to the transfer of ownership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccabe Mine</ENAMEX> to Elders in that ``He was retained to evaluate the mine and operate it if we got it back into production,'' and now there isn't a mine for the company to operate.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX>, 57 years old, was named president in April when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan West</ENAMEX> acquired 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coronado Resources Inc.</ENAMEX>, a Canadian exploration company of which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> was president. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> was traveling yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment.
