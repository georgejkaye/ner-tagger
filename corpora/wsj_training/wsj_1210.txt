<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX> said third-quarter net income plunged 85% to $7.2 million from last year's $49.1 million, or 99 cents a share, because of ravages of Hurricane Hugo and increased reserves for legal expenses.
Payout of preferred dividends resulted in a net loss of five cents a share in the most recent quarter. Revenue edged up 3.4% to $904 million from $874 million in last year's third quarter.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's</ENAMEX> closed at $35.50 a share, down 50 cents.
Impact of the Oct. 17 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake, which will be recorded in the fourth quarter, isn't expected to exceed $50 million after taxes, the company added.
For the nine months, the insurance company said net fell 46% to $88.8 million, or $1.54 a share, from $164 million, or $3.16 a share, the previous year. Revenue slid 7% to $2.6 billion from $2.8 billion a year earlier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's Fund</ENAMEX> property-liability subsidiaries reported a 120.7% combined underwriting ratio for the nine months, up from 108.4% for the year-ago period.
Hurricane Hugo accounted for about $36 million in pretax third-quarter losses, net of reinsurance recoveries.
The company said there was an additional increase in loss and loss-expense reserves of $71 million reflecting ``higher than expected'' development in claims legal expenses from to prior periods.
For the third quarter, net premiums were $742 million, up 9.6% from $677 million in last year's quarter, because of the expiration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Indemnity</ENAMEX> quota share reinsurance agreement.
Net premiums written through Sept. 30 fell 5% to $2.1 billion from $2.2 billion a year ago, because of the writing of fewer policies at flat prices, the company said.
Third-quarter and nine-month results don't include any provision for premium returns that could be ordered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Department of Insurance</ENAMEX> under Proposition 103. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's Fund</ENAMEX> said it has applied for an exemption from these rate rollbacks, and plans to defend its filing in hearings before the department.
