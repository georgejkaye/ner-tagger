<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> has so far failed to make a $1.6 billion interest payment that was due to banks Monday, bankers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brazilian</ENAMEX> officials said.
Some Brazilian officials still expect an 11th-hour agreement with the International Monetary Fund that would probably unlock substantial funds pledged to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>. This would boost <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>'s ability to make interest payments.
Even if there is no short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> agreement, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> still may choose to make some of the interest payment now overdue to banks.
That's because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> is eager to extend a Sept. 30 deadline for drawing the last $600 million portion of a $5.2 billion bank loan agreed on last year. To get such an extension <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> needs acceptance by 95% of its bank creditors. Clearly, these institutions are more likely to grant such an extension if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> is seen to be current on its present obligations, or at least trying to be current on them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>'s foreign debt currently totals about $110 billion.
Brazilian officials have warned in recent weeks that they won't run their foreign-exchange reserves below ``reasonable levels'' to make interest payments to banks. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> failed to reach inflation and government deficit targets it agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>, about $3 billion of credits from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>, commercial banks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Development Bank</ENAMEX> and commercial banks have been blocked.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meantime</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> said it renewed a $100 million short-term loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bolivia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> said the loan provides support for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bolivia</ENAMEX>'s financial position as its government continues a program of comprehensive structural reform.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> in a report to Congress required under the 1988 trade act yesterday again rejected proposals for setting up a government-managed ``debt facility,'' or fund, in an attempt to solve the payments problems of developing countries. Such a facility is unnecessary, he told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, stressing that it would disrupt and delay cuts in debt and interest payments under the present strengthened debt strategy.
