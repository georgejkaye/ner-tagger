The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> approved a bill that would force regulators to require banks to establish ``significantly greater'' loan-loss reserves for troubled Third World loans.
But the bill contains no specific targets for reserves, and banks that participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX>'s plan to reduce Third World debt could hold smaller reserves than those that don't. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> plan, initiated by Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX>, stresses debt and debt-service reduction over new lending.
The provision, sponsored by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lafalce</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>) and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Fauntroy</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>), was part of a larger bill authorizing $200 million for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Export-Import Bank</ENAMEX>, about $90 million for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Development Bank</ENAMEX> and $150 million for interest-subsidy programs of the International Monetary Fund.
The two congressmen had originally pushed for a provision requiring specific minimum loan-loss reserves, but the provision was watered down last week in subcommittee action. Under the bill, regulators would be required to force banks to maintain loan-loss reserves ``in general significantly greater than existing levels,'' according to a committee staff document. But regulators can require smaller reserves for loans involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brady</ENAMEX> plan renegotiations of debt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gonzalez</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>) said decisions last week by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.</ENAMEX> to voluntarily boost their reserves demonstrated that the legislation is ``right on target.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> said that regulators ``led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>, should have been more forthcoming in having the banks increase their reserves'' against Third World debt.
