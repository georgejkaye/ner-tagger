<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rally's Inc.</ENAMEX> said it filed suit in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> against a group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Sugarman</ENAMEX>, seeking to block the investors from buying more shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rally's</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>, fast-food chain, alleges that the three investors, who are directors of the company, broke securities laws because they didn't disclose their intentions to acquire a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rally</ENAMEX>'s stake.
The group, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Group Ltd.</ENAMEX> and its chairman, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX>, owns about 45.2% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rally</ENAMEX>'s. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filings, the group has said it may seek control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rally</ENAMEX>'s.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> called the lawsuit ``not nice'' and said his group will continue to push for control of the company and the removal of certain directors.
He asserts that some directors, who have joined forces with company founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Patterson</ENAMEX>, have ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s, a competing hamburger chain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patterson group</ENAMEX>, which controls about 42% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rally</ENAMEX>'s shares, also may seek control.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rally</ENAMEX>'s also said it formed a committee of three directors, who aren't associated with either the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patterson</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> groups, to analyze the situation.
