Stocks bounced back with the bond market, though a late bout of speculative selling combined with some computer-guided sell programs to trim the session's early gains.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average closed 4.75 higher at 2663.94. At one point, the average was up more than 23 points.
Bargain-hunting after Monday's sell-off and a recovery in the Treasury bond market helped underpin stocks. Prices rose at the opening, after the bond market showed little reaction to news that August durable goods orders rose 3.8%, a sharper advance than expected. The dollar's stability despite central bank intervention helped boost the market as well.
Volume came to 158,350,000 shares on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, well ahead of Monday's 121,130,000. But aside from buying interest in single-country stock funds and issues of movie companies, trading remained sluggish.
``It's a crazy market, with little institutional activity,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas R. Walsh</ENAMEX>, head of equity trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Securities International.</ENAMEX> ``I certainly think it's looking for direction and has been for some weeks now.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Harmon</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> floor broker for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MKI Securities</ENAMEX>, said, ``There is no impetus here -- no real buying, no real selling, and programs have had an inordinate impact because there is not much volume.''
Stocks of movie companies continued to rise as analysts reassessed the studios' value in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s reported $3 billion takeover bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications</ENAMEX> climbed 1 1/2 to 56 1/4 on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite volume of 1.2 million shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> advanced 2 to 65 5/8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orion Pictures</ENAMEX> gained 5/8 to 22 3/4.

Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogel</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> could be valued at $110 a share to an acquirer.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Upham & Co.</ENAMEX> repeated buy recommendations on all three issues.
