<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff Inc.</ENAMEX>, seeing $100 million in planned financing evaporate, put itself under bankruptcy court protection for the second time in seven years and made plans to resurrect a small portion of its grounded fleet.
After a directors meeting that went late into the night Wednesday, the airline made its Chapter 11 filing at 1:35 a.m. yesterday morning in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, where the company recently moved its corporate headquarters. The filing came less than 12 hours after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> abruptly began canceling flights and sending workers home.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s bankruptcy filing hardly changes the airline industry's competitive balance of power -- the tiny carrier is a distant 13th in a top-heavy field of 22. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s first collapse, when it was a much larger company, was seen as a watershed in airline deregulation, illustrating the perils of cocky overexpansion. This new collapse is an object lesson in the difficulties a small carrier has surviving in today's concentrated airline industry.
``In the current airline environment, major airlines enjoy a distinct competitive advantage over smaller carriers in the use of their computer reservations systems, frequent flier programs, pricing, and control of facilities and slots at capacity-controlled airports,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William G. Mcgee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s chairman, said in a statement.
Yesterday morning, some 2,800 Braniff workers received mailgrams beginning: ``We regret to inform you that you are furloughed indefinitely.'' The reduction cuts the work force by 58%.
The airline said it flew four flights yesterday. It plans to have 40 operating by Monday to 11 cities. Previously it flew to 40 cities. The airline said it plans to maintain reduced hub operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> and offered a plan to honor tickets already bought.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> offered few details on why it suddenly sought the refuge of the bankruptcy court again. Top executives weren't answering questions and events were moving so quickly and apparently haphazardly that their representatives could offer little elaboration. ``We've had 100 calls an hour for the past 24 hours,'' said a spokeswoman.
But in its written statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> said, ``The company has suffered a liquidity problem as a result of a delay in completing recently announced financing and a softening of airline traffic and yields in recent months.''
To make it through what it knew would be a tight autumn, when airline traffic normally slows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> had counted on three linked financings. It planned to get around $70 million from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPA New York Financial Services</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPA Group Ltd.</ENAMEX>, the giant Irish concern that leases Braniff 30 of its 68 planes. That cash infusion was part of an intricate transaction in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> would lease 20 new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737-300 jets valued at about $600 million.
The airline was attempting to secure another $12 million by posting some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> gates as collateral, and was aiming to get the rest of the roughly $100 million through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> placement. All three transactions fell through in the last several days. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPA</ENAMEX> deal was canceled by mutual consent, according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPA</ENAMEX> spokesman, though the reason it and the other transactions failed remains unclear.
``It's like building a spider web,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> spokesman said. ``It's the type of situation where if all the things had worked it would have been glorious. But now it's the opposite.''
Even senior management was caught off guard by the need to seek bankruptcy protection. Only Monday night, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgee</ENAMEX> assured business leaders at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rotary Club</ENAMEX> meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s plans to expand service there were right on track. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgee</ENAMEX> was scheduled to make another such speech yesterday morning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civic Council</ENAMEX>, a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>'s top 100 business owners. His office called the organization late Wednesday afternoon to cancel the appearance, just as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> started canceling flights.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s bankruptcy filing shows the swift decline of available cash as it loaded up on debt to expand. Between January 31 and July 31, the company's cash position dwindled to $3.6 million from $31.6 million. During the same period, its long-term liabilities shot up to $177.5 million from $95.5 million.
Burdened with such debt costs and some inefficient aircraft, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> has said it needed to fill 72.4% of its seats to break even, an exceptionally high level by industry standards. It filled only 64.2% in the six months ended July 31, down from 67.5% a year earlier. It increased the amount of profit made for every mile it flew in the period to 11.1 cents from 9.1 cents, but that wasn't enough.
Even before the filing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> was missing payments to certain suppliers. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>'s mayor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard L. Berkley</ENAMEX>, said the carrier was 37 days past due on its rent for gates at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas City International Airport</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> had quadrupled flights in the past year. A city councilman there said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> also was late paying bills from a local fuel supplier. The airline's liquidity problem was so severe that by last week many suppliers began demanding cash payment on delivery, according to a person familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> has insisted all along it had to grow to survive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accordingly</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgee</ENAMEX> had daring plans to triple the size of the airline's fleet by 1991, increase revenue by 30% and flights by 25%. Earlier this year, it placed orders and options for 100 new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Airbus Industrie</ENAMEX> A-320s through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPA</ENAMEX>, an order worth about $3 billion. Five have been delivered so far this year, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> expected to take delivery of another 11 between now and next June.
``We had to build,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> spokesman said. ``Still do.''
