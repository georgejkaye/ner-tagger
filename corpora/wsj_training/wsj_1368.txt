<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William D. Forrester</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Council</ENAMEX>, has a warning for U.S. companies trying to do business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. ``It's an extremely complex market, and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forrester</ENAMEX> says. ``We are not trying to encourage everyone.''
Undeterred by such words of caution, corporate America is flocking to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>, lured by a huge untapped market and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s attempt to overhaul the Soviet economy. Doing business with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russians</ENAMEX>, once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans, has become the goal of such major companies as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble Co.</ENAMEX>, as well as a cluster of smaller firms. Reflecting the new-found interest, more than 140 U.S. companies are taking part in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> exhibition organized by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forrester</ENAMEX>'s trade group.
But while U.S. interest may be big and growing, the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating. Alongside the old problems of a non-convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy, Western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked to perestroika, the restructuring of the Soviet economy.
Executives say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s moves to break up the government's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities. Changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced Soviet players, many who promise more than they can deliver. And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles, their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation's republics.
``You have to go out to all your constituents,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James H. Giffen</ENAMEX>, who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market, involving investment of more than $5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures. As part of that attempt, by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trade Consortium</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giffen</ENAMEX> says he spends a lot of time lobbying.
Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans. Over the past two years, Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Combustion Engineering Inc.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montedison S.p. A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> and several Japanese groups, about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants. The plans have come under fire from Soviet environmentalists, and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped.
Whatever the difficulties, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> remains committed to increasing foreign trade. For political as well as economic reasons, U.S. companies are at the top of his priorities -- a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the U.S. trade show last week.
Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> appeared impatient for a big expansion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-Soviet trade, which now amounts to a meager $3 billion annually. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures, behind <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>. According to several people present at the meeting, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, possibly at his next summit meeting with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>.
Judging by the crush at the exhibition, deprived Soviet consumers are more than ready for U.S. products. Hundreds of people lined up every day at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste, a commodity in chronically short supply here. And unruly crowds at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>'s booth almost knocked over a glass showcase in the rush to get a free Camel cigarette sticker.
Some U.S. products are filtering into the Soviet market under an emergency import program. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> have received big orders for toothpaste, soap and detergents. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trade Consortium</ENAMEX> says it is planning to ship some $500 million of consumer goods, financed by bank credits, in the first few months of next year.
But the current Soviet purchasing spree may be a one-time affair. The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive. Because the Soviet ruble isn't convertible into dollars, marks and other Western currencies, companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up, however. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelley M. Zeiger</ENAMEX>, an entrepreneur from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> who buys Soviet porcelain and ``matryoshka'' nesting dolls for export to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, says West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items.
Seeking to overcome the currency problems, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giffen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trade Consortium</ENAMEX>, which comprises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson & Johnson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.</ENAMEX>, has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings, largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project. Several medical concerns, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbott Laboratories</ENAMEX> intend to pursue a similar consortium approach.
``It's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis A. Sokol</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Service Partners Inc.</ENAMEX>, who is putting the medical consortium together.
Some U.S. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale. One group seeks to publish a U.S.-Soviet medical journal in conjunction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard P. Mills</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>-based official of the U.S. partner, 10,000 copies of the quarterly will be printed in Russian from next year. It will be financed by advertisements from U.S. companies and by simultaneous publication of an English-language journal containing details of Soviet medical advancements.
``We found a market niche,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> boasts. ``It's truly entrepreneurial.
