<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> sent President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> an $18.4 billion fiscal 1990 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> bill providing $5.5 billion for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> and increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>'s air-interdiction program nearly a third.
Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch.
An estimated $33 million was added for university and science grants, including $1.5 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith College</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> lawmakers were a driving force behind $54.6 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> border facilities, or more than double the administration's request.
More than $1.8 million is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents, and the budget for the official residence of Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> is more than doubled, with $200,000 designated for improvements to the property. Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> is remembered with an extra $1 million to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb.
Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, nearly $1.95 billion is provided for processing tax returns, a 12% increase over fiscal 1989 and double what the government was spending five years ago. Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to $1.6 billion, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> specifically added $7.4 million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic.
The large increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> air-interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling, and the annual appropriations level has more than quadrupled in five years. The $196.7 million provided for fiscal 1990 anticipates the purchase of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed P</ENAMEX>-3 surveillance aircraft and five Cessna <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Citation II</ENAMEX> jets. Despite administration reservations, the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cessna</ENAMEX>'s home state, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX>.
Among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> expenditure for enforcement of a 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans. Small-business interests have lobbied against the so-called Section 89 tax rules. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repeal</ENAMEX> is considered likely now, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> bill has been used as a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim.
Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> Republicans on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> to retroactively ``move'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> hospital from one county to the next to justify higher Medicare reimbursements. The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $1.4 million in claims made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Care Finance Administration</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEI</ENAMEX>, which owned the hospital in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sullivan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>, during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment.
In a separate development, a private meeting is scheduled this morning between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss.</ENAMEX>) and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ark.</ENAMEX>) in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated $44 billion agriculture bill. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill, but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX>-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
The program's nonprofit sponsors received $900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990. The 79-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mississippian</ENAMEX> takes a more orthodox, entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use, but as a master of pork-barrel politics, he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> center near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Mississippi</ENAMEX> border.
