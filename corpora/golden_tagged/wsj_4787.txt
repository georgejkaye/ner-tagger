<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> agreed to pay $42 million for a 10% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>, in the latest Japanese linkup with a U.S. money-management firm.
The price agreed to by the world's largest property and casualty insurance company places an indicated value on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> money-management firm far exceeding that paid in a leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX> last year. Since the buy-out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX>'s assets under management have increased about a third to almost $24 billion.
A leveraged-buy-out fund organized by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> merchant bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harlan Inc.</ENAMEX> and including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX>'s top executives acquired the firm for $305 million in mid-1988. Most of the acquisition price represented assumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX>'s debt, which now stands at $200 million.
The $42 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine</ENAMEX> agreed to pay suggests that acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX> today would have an indicated cost of $420 million plus the assumption of $200 million in debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX> said it will use the money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine</ENAMEX> to reduce debt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX>'s sharply higher value ``reflects both the {rising} stock market and how well the company has performed,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Harlan</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harlan.</ENAMEX> He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine</ENAMEX> would handle investments in each other's markets, giving clients ``a two-way street with asset managers on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific.</ENAMEX>''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine</ENAMEX>, a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Group</ENAMEX>, will receive a seat on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX>'s board and can assign six professionals to obtain training from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> firm. Closing for the accord is expected next month.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Securities Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> last summer agreed to buy a 50% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo Bank</ENAMEX>'s money-management operation for $125 million. Other Japanese firms have joint ventures with or ownership stakes in U.S. money managers.
