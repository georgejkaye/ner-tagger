The Canadian government, with a view to becoming more politically active in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization of American States</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based regional agency.
The expected Canadian move has been welcomed by the Bush administration even though <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX>, the invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grenada</ENAMEX> and the military support for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> guerrillas.
Latin American countries have long urged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAS</ENAMEX> in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, which for many years tended to dominate the 32-nation organization.
Even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> also has supported Canadian membership, it hasn't been a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> priority. ``The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAS</ENAMEX> hasn't been, over the years, an item high on the U.S. agenda,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan Gotlieb</ENAMEX>, former Canadian ambassador to the U.S.
The Canadian application is expected to be announced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Jose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX>, by Canadian Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX>, who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulroney</ENAMEX> said recently.
Some Canadian political commentators have opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s joining what they see as a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-dominated organization. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> could do plenty of things to get serious about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire'' between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and Latin American members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAS</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Simpson</ENAMEX>, a columnist in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe & Mail</ENAMEX> newspaper.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, at times, could be an awkward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAS</ENAMEX> partner for the U.S. if its United Nations voting record is an indication. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. General Assembly</ENAMEX> votes last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> voted the same as the U.S. only 63% of the time. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> voted the same as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> 76% of the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> 79% and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> 83%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Birns</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council on Hemispheric Affairs</ENAMEX>, a liberal research group, said that Latin American countries would be ``profoundly disappointed'' if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> were to follow the U.S. lead in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OAS</ENAMEX>. ``Latin Americans see <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> as a non-interventionist power that respects their sovereignty,'' he said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAS</ENAMEX>, which tries to promote peace and economic development within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americas</ENAMEX>, is attempting to find a settlement of the current Panama political crisis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX> has been suspended from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OAS</ENAMEX> membership, but the organization's members are discussing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX>'s reinstatement.
