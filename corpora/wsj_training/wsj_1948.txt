<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> may be tough on Wall Street for some, but a few bosses are making as much as ever -- or more.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns Cos.</ENAMEX>, for example, the 15 executive officers led by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan ``Ace'' Greenberg</ENAMEX> got a pay increase to $35.9 million for the 14-month period ended June 30 from $22.9 million for the 12 months ended April 30, 1988. The figures don't include substantial dividends on holdings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> stock. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> himself was paid $4.5 million, before an estimated $1.5 million in dividends, up from $2.4 million the year before.
The increase is noted in the brokerage firm's latest proxy statement filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>. Because it operates on a fiscal year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>'s yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms. The latest period includes 14 months instead of 12 because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> changed to a fiscal year ending in June instead of April.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>'s 650 stock and bond salesmen saw thinner paychecks over the past year, which the company says reflected lower commission revenue caused by a decline in investor activity in the markets. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> on Monday reported improved earnings for its first quarter, ended Sept. 29, partly because of a 31% increase in commissions during the quarter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Montgoris</ENAMEX>, chief financial officer, defended the lofty salaries at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>. ``All of us are on a base salary of $200,000 if the firm makes nothing -- and that's pretty low as far as Wall Street goes,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montgoris</ENAMEX> said. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> has never had an unprofitable year since its founding 65 years ago.
Four <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> executives besides the 62-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> were paid $3 million or more before dividends for the 14 months ended in June.
According to the proxy statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James E. Cayne</ENAMEX>, 55, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>'s president, made $3.9 million; an executive vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael L. Tarnopol</ENAMEX>, 53, made nearly $3.4 million; and two executive vice presidents, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent J. Mattone</ENAMEX>, 44, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. Michaelcheck</ENAMEX>, 42, made about $3.3 million each.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montgoris</ENAMEX> said the firm has a ``straight mathematical formula'' for determining compensation, based on the firm's earnings. ``Just because a particular element of the firm is down,'' such as stockbrokerage, ``doesn't mean the executive committee should be paid less,'' he said.
