The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today, just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> this morning plans to begin trading its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange Stock Portfolio</ENAMEX> ``basket'' product, the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange's seal of approval. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esps</ENAMEX> will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s index in a single trade of a minimum of $5 million. ``Customized'' baskets of fewer stocks will also be available.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> gave provisional six-month approval to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> basket at a meeting late yesterday. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX>, where the minimum will be $1.7 million. Also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
The basket products are ``an evolutionary step'' in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Grundfest</ENAMEX>.
New <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX>, overseeing his first public meeting, said there have been concerns that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>'s basket could attract investors with a ``short-term perspective'' who would rapidly turn over the product, thus increasing volatility.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Ketchum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s market regulation chief, said he didn't believe ``this will spawn dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be destabilizing.''
The baskets on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBOE</ENAMEX> -- which involve the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> stocks, unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures markets, and index options on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBOE</ENAMEX> -- will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market's wild price swings.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more-volatile forms of program trading.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esps</ENAMEX> are also an attempt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> officials also hope Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange's product.
Already, many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>'s own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public. The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product, with the $5 million minimum, will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to ``wild spasms of volatility.''
Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>'s new product confirms the exchange doesn't want to curtail program trading, which last month accounted for a record 13.8% of the exchange's average daily volume.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> is losing its cool here,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Andrews</ENAMEX>, head of institutional trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. The new stock baskets ``are going to make it easier for program trading to be done. And it's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places.''
Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board's Exchange Stock Portfolio</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> exchange's Market Basket are designed for institutional investors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> lists its targets as pension plans, mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders. In index arbitrage, program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets.
At the same time, only four securities firms have signed up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> to buy and sell Esps as market makers, an unenthusiastic response. The market makers so far are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston Group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> unit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> unit that has become the biggest program trader along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX>, isn't a market maker, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> hopes that will change. Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> hopes to entice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> Neither has plans to be a market maker for now.
Traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> officials say only 25 contracts a day may trade at first, equivalent to a day's action at a small, regional exchange.
Even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> says its product represents a post-crash ``reform,'' some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month's Friday the 13th market plunge, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 points it did.
With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult, program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system, the traders say. ``If we had the baskets, we would be leaving in caskets,'' one trader said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> said the after-hours trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> exchange would help the U.S. win back business that has moved overseas to conduct after-hours trades.
