<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Next Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Jobs</ENAMEX>'s closely held company, said it completed the first version of the operating-system software for its much-anticipated new computer.
The announcement, which had been expected, marks an important milestone for both Next and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX>, who co-founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> but quit in 1985 after a management power struggle.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> had previously impressed many industry analysts with the advanced hardware dreamed up for Next, but the operating-system software had been delayed for months by bugs and other glitches. Operating-system software controls a computer's basic functions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, Next plans to rely heavily on sales to universities. Thus, analysts had considered it critical that the company complete the software and have the finished machine ready before the end of this month, when many students and faculty begin a new academic year.
Next's software has many of the same general features -- icons, pull-down menus, windows and desktop imagery -- that are credited with fueling the popularity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s Macintosh computer, whose design Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> oversaw in the early 1980s. However, it is written in a variant of Unix, a computer language widely used by scientists and engineers. Although Unix is more powerful than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DOS</ENAMEX>, the standard language for personal-computer programs, it is more complex and doesn't yet offer many applications popular with users of personal computers, such as spreadsheets and databases.
