<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark Corp.</ENAMEX>, as expected, said it replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage Inc.</ENAMEX>'s board through shareholder consents and elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh C. Shurtleff</ENAMEX> as chairman.
The move ends a bitter battle for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>, which is 62.5% owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> unit. Previously, only one Southmark director served on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s board.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>, an operator of nursing homes and retirement centers, hasn't acknowledged the change. A spokeswoman said late Friday that the company's agent still is counting and verifying the consents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> said that at the first meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s new board late Wednesday, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Galecke</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> executive, was elected vice chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>, a troubled real-estate and thrift concern, said it hasn't made any other management changes yet.
In addition to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shurtleff</ENAMEX>, a former executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valhi Inc.</ENAMEX> and a Southmark director, Southmark-supported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX> board members are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Brown</ENAMEX> IV, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur L. Crowe Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Colquitt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John R. Mcdonough</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Leigh Sanders Jr.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Verbrugge</ENAMEX>. All but Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanders and Mcdonough</ENAMEX> currently are Southmark board members.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shurtleff</ENAMEX> said the new board will review <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s management and operations and try to improve its financial performance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s management had tried to distance itself from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> and spin off its two main businesses into two new companies as part of a restructuring. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>, which has said it plans to sell its health-care interests as part of its reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws, opposed the spinoffs and began a fight to gain control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s board. It had to have consents representing 66% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s shares to change the method for electing directors and replace the board.
