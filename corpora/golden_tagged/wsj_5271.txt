After years of failures and false starts, Green power may be about to enter the Spanish Parliament.
For the first time ever, a coalition of ecological parties announced plans for a joint campaigning platform under the title of ``The Greens <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX> List'' for elections Oct. 29.
Given voting patterns in last June's elections for the European Parliament in which a panoply of Green-labeled parties took a total of more than 400,000 votes, they stand a chance of winning at least one or two seats in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>'s 350-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cortes</ENAMEX>.
Though their influence is likely to be minimal, they could contribute to reducing the dominance of Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe Gonzalez</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> and possibly even to robbing him of an overall majority.
``Opinion polls show the Green vote is growing,'' claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humberto da Cruz</ENAMEX>, a bearded 40-year-old sociology professor who's chairman of the Spanish Federation of Friends of the Earth and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greens</ENAMEX>' standard-bearer for the current campaign.
From 60,000 to 70,000 votes for ecological candidates a few years ago, he told a news conference, ``We moving in the direction of 700,000 to 800,000 votes in these elections.''
His coalition, uniting five parties and scores of local groupings, is the first serious attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> to turn ecological concerns into a political force similar to Green movements in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>.
Even a turnout consolidating the 400,000 votes cast for Green candidates in last June's European elections could ensure the Greens one seat each in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Madrid</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, and possibly a third in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valencia</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da Cruz</ENAMEX> said.
For the moment, however, in a nation notorious for widespread indifference to ecological questions, his Green coalition faces a doubly difficult task.
In addition to competing with such maverick candidates as former sherry salesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose-Maria Ruiz-Mateos</ENAMEX>, the ex-chairman of the Rumasa banking and commercial conglomerate, its members will have to teach voters to distinguish between them and rival groups with Green labels, including an offshoot of a quasi-religious sect and an extreme right-wing organization.
Despite plans to make clear that ``we're the real <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greens</ENAMEX>,'' among other things by using recycled paper for its pamphlets, the coalition's campaign got off to a shaky start.
The few journalists attending the news press conference had to do without the explanatory leaflets that had been prepared for them because a car belonging to one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greens</ENAMEX> was towed away for illegal parking.
