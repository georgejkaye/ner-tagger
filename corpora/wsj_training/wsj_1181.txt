The bank reported net income of C$389 million for the nine months ended July 31. The bank said the increase in loan-loss provisions won't affect the payment of dividends.
The bank said reserves now amount to 61% of its total less-developed-country exposure. Excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>, reserves equal 95% of LDC exposure.
