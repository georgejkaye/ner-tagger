Axa Midi Assurances S.A. unveiled plans for a friendly share swap aimed at gaining total control of four of its majority-held insurance units.
Axa Midi said the proposed bid covers Drouot Assurances S.A., Paternelle Risques Divers, Presence Vie and Presence Assurances, and would value the shares it doesn't already own in the units at about 430 million francs ($65.4 million).
The spokeswoman said Axa Midi will create new shares for the swap and estimated this would put about 14.5% of its stock in the hands of the public. Cie. du Midi currently holds 99.7% of Axa Midi.
The boards of all four units have approved the proposed bid, which is pending regulatory approval before being launched.
Axa Midi was expected to regroup its insurance units to promote cooperation between them and simplify the structure that resulted from the 1988 merger of the Axa insurance group with Cie. du Midi.
