<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco Pictures Inc.</ENAMEX> acquired a 33% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista Organization Ltd.</ENAMEX> as part of an agreement that could ultimately give Carolco ownership of the entire company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> also agreed to acquire an affiliated partnership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based movie company best known for such action films as the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambo</ENAMEX>'' series, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> motion-picture production and financing concern. If all aspects of the two complicated transactions announced yesterday are completed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> makes the exchange offer for the partnership and ultimately acquires all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX>, the total value of the transactions would amount to an indicated value of about $70 million in cash and securities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> didn't put a dollar value on the transactions.
In addition, a subsidiary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX> partnership agreed to invest $30 million in four <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> motion pictures that are under production, as part of a new joint venture.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> and its affilates have been sniffing around Vista for a few years. In February 1988, a predecessor company to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX>'s 48%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> had agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX> and the assets of the partnership for common stock with an indicated market value of $25.1 million, and $30 million of preferred stock. But that transaction never came to fruition. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live</ENAMEX>'s predecessor did, however, acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX>'s home-video unit and ancillary rights.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX> has been prominent in the news since late last month, when the company's chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Menendez</ENAMEX>, and his wife were shot to death in their <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> mansion. In an effort to boost Live's share price, which fell sharply on speculation that the murders might possibly be linked to organized crime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> earlier this week announced that it and its officers would be buying an unspecified amount of Live stock in the open market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> had considered using some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX> shares it holds as partial payment for the Vista transactions, ``but when the stock price fell sharply, that came out of the picture,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Smith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX>'s chief financial officer.
Under the agreement announced yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> acquired 11 million newly issued shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista Organization Ltd.</ENAMEX>, or about a 33% stake, and warrants to buy an additional six million shares for 50 cents each, boosting its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX> to 43%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> acquired the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX> shares in exchange for the right of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX>'s shareholders to sell the rest of their stock to Carolco in a little over two years for $1.08 a share, payable in cash or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> stock. The agreement has an indicated value of $24 million, based on 22 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX> shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis prior to yesterday's agreement.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> has agreed to make an exchange offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista Organization Partnership Limited Partnership</ENAMEX>, which it plans to eventually liquidate.
