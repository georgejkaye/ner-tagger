The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmics</ENAMEX> unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amityville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>
Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month, following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> requested the recall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX>'s mioxidil tablets, chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because, it said, the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, agreed to recall four other products, trazadone, doxepin, diazepam and lorazapam, because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>.
No safety problems with the products are known, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> said. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> spokesperson said the drugs are still available under other brand names.
Last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products</ENAMEX> said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX>'s generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit. It also temporarily closed Quantum, because of the internal investigation, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s ongoing inquiry.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Home Products</ENAMEX> rose 75 cents to $105 on Friday.
