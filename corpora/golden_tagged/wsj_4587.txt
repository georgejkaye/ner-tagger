``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX>,'' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> situation comedy touted as a sure hit for the fall season, is off to a sluggish start.

Executives at other networks used the figures to needle their rival. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Entertainment</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brandon Tartikoff</ENAMEX> said viewers had ``rejected'' the show. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David F. Poltrack</ENAMEX>, senior vice president of planning and research at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Broadcast Group</ENAMEX>, a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX>, called the figures ``a sign of dissatisfaction.''
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX>'' was No. 14 for the first week of the 1989-90 TV season, with an 18.4 rating and 29 share, compared with ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roseanne</ENAMEX>,'' which was No. 2 with a 24.7 rating and 38 share, behind ``The Cosby Show'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>, which is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicken Soup</ENAMEX>'' premiered the week before, getting a 21.8 rating and a 34 share against repeats on the other networks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX>, said it was satisfied with the performance of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicken Soup.</ENAMEX>'' ``It's only the first week,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Wurtzel</ENAMEX>, senior vice president of marketing and research services. ``I'm happy with a 29 share and I'm sure my colleagues at the other networks would be as well.'' A ratings point equals 904,000 TV households; shares are the percentage of sets in use.
