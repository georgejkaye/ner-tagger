<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern California Edison Co.</ENAMEX>, one of the nation's largest investor-owned utilities, said it signed an accord with black and Hispanic groups, promising substantial improvements in minority employment at the company's highest levels.
The broad-based agreement calls for the company to increase female and minority representation among its top 100 managers to 20% by the year 2000 from 6% currently, and to 30% among its top 500 managers from 13%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern California Edison</ENAMEX> said it entered into the plan to better meet its long-term business goals. The utility, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCE Corp.</ENAMEX>, serves much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>.
Political analysts noted that the agreement includes a recommendation to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Utility Commission</ENAMEX> endorsing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern California Edison</ENAMEX>'s proposed merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gas & Electric Co.</ENAMEX> Various <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> groups bitterly oppose the merger. Political support from minority groups may help convince regulators that the consolidation is, on balance, politically acceptable.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern California Edison</ENAMEX> said it will make ``a good-faith effort'' to achieve each of the promised steps, which include an undertaking to boost its purchases from female and minority-owned businesses to 30% of its $1 billion annual supply and service contracts by 1998 from about 11%.
