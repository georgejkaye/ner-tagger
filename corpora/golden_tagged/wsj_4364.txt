<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immune Response Corp.</ENAMEX> has 29 employees, no marketable product, no sales and no earnings. But if all goes well for the company, it soon will have a stock-market valuation of as much as $135 million, thanks to Wall Street.
The new-issues equity market, it appears, is heating up. Many of the players think the success of Immune Response of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, which is already circulating its preliminary prospectus, could mark a turning point for the entire market.
If Immune Response's offering fares well, many other young technology companies now effectively barred from going public might be able to take the plunge, investment bankers and investors say. The Immune Response offering, still subject to clearance by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, is tentatively scheduled for late October.
Although it still lacks a marketable product, the company has a glamorous concept that could prove to be enormously lucrative -- an AIDS vaccine. Moreover, the celebrated father of the polio vaccine, 74-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonas Salk</ENAMEX>, is chairman of the company's scientific advisory board. ``That's the kind of sizzle investors long to buy,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Ramseier</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunetech Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> drug maker.
Wall Street underwriters, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>, hope to raise as much $45 million by selling about one-third of Immune Response's shares to the public at $11 to $13 each. ``Pretty expensive,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Weisbrod</ENAMEX>, a biotechnology analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. One influential <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> mutual-fund manager says many institutions are avoiding -- as too risky -- investments in biotechnology companies that lack marketable products. Although a biotechnology investor himself, he has yet to make up his mind whether to buy Immune Response shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James B. Glavin</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer of Immune Response, couldn't be reached for comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles J. Cashion</ENAMEX>, vice president and chief financial officer, said of the proposed price: ``We haven't just pulled the numbers out of the air. We wouldn't be seeking the price if we didn't think it was the right one.'' A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> had no immediate comment.
It's too early to tell how the underwriters will fare; some meetings between Immune Response officials and potential investors aren't even due to take place until mid-October. But succeed or fail, the attempted underwriting may have great market significance. ``It's a bellwether for whether the markets are going to be receptive to funding emerging technology, something they haven't done for the last two years,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Drake</ENAMEX>, a biotechnology analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vector Securities International Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> securities firm.
If the offering succeeds, ``it could create a lot of hope for many biotechnology companies looking for capital,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick J. Dotzler</ENAMEX>, managing general partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicus Venture Partners</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Menlo Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> Even before the outcome is clear, the offering is prompting some small technology companies to inquire about their chances of going public, adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Robertson</ENAMEX>, a principal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robertson, Stephens & Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> investment bank.
For much of this year, such chances were poor indeed. ``Every time underwriters have tried to bring out something a little racy, it hasn't done well,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Murphy</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Technology Stock Letter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDD Information Services</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> research concern, says initial public offerings in the first nine months raised about $8.5 billion, a sharp drop from nearly $19 billion in the year-earlier period.
Although some technology companies have been among those going public this year, ``the high-tech market is a pale shadow of what it was in 1983,'' the speculative peak, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman G. Fosback</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Issues newsletter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>
After 1983, and especially following the October 1987 stock-market crash, many investors turned away from small companies as investments or, at minimum, insisted on high quality, usually defined as a record of growing profits. ``Investors have been discriminating in their pick of new issues,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Mathias</ENAMEX>, managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T. Rowe Price Associates</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> manager of mutual funds.
With the stock market robust once again, some institutional investors began returning to the new-issues market early this year, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard L. Franyo</ENAMEX>, the investment banking chief for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alex.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown & Sons Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>. One result was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Network General Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountain View</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, maker of diagnostic tools for data-communications systems, easily raised $17 million in its initial public offering in February. The shares have more than doubled since then, stirring further interest in the new-issues market, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franyo</ENAMEX> says.
Among companies hoping to exploit the situation by going public by year-end are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Arts</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mateo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, maker of entertainment software for computers; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lattice Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beaverton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore.</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunogen Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, biotechnology company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS Computer Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, plans a public offering early next year.
As for Immune Response, which Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salk</ENAMEX> helped found, the company says it is going public because it needs capital to offset anticipated operating losses as it develops its first products. Although the company has already received more than $17 million from private placements -- the investors include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rorer Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> -- it expects to spend much more than that before seeing a profit.
The company says its first product under development, an AIDS vaccine, is based on a scientific approach first suggested by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salk</ENAMEX>. As he had done with polio, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salk</ENAMEX> proposed using whole but inactivated AIDS viruses to inoculate people already infected. But some other scientists say such viruses are unsafe in humans, and Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salk</ENAMEX>'s approach is by no means a certain winner.
Still, because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salk</ENAMEX> name and track record, Immune Response shares may have great appeal to individual investors -- which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>, the chief underwriter, is particularly adept at reaching. ``It's the kind of thing the public is interested in,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mccamant</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Technology Stock Letter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, says of the pending offering. The new-issues market is strong enough that the offering ``is probably doable,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccamant</ENAMEX> says.
Others caution, however, that no name -- even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonas Salk</ENAMEX>'s -- can guarantee a company's success. In 1983, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symbion Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> (then called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolff Medical Inc.</ENAMEX>), went public at $12.50 a share. The company had appeal largely because its president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert K. Jarvik</ENAMEX>, had implanted an artificial heart in patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barney Clark</ENAMEX>, whose name became a household word. But the artificial-heart market failed to develop as projected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Symbion</ENAMEX> shares now trade at about $2 and Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarvik</ENAMEX> has long since left the company.
