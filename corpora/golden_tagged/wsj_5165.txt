As the relentlessly optimistic decade of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> comes to a close, it's appropriate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mcguane</ENAMEX> has written another novel.
For much of the past 20 years, this iconoclastic macho man has holed up in the hills of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX> and built a loyal following for his complex books on human despair, antimaterialism and the meaninglessness of modern life, anchoring his tales of woe with razor-sharp descriptions and biting humor. He also has scared off a good many readers with his unconventional plots and the often impenetrable monologues delivered by self-absorbed, usually boozed-out protagonists.
Consider this rambling aside from the scrambled mind of would-be Key West fishing guide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Skelton</ENAMEX>, in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcguane</ENAMEX>'s most acclaimed novel, ``Ninety-Two in the Shade'': ``The king's ransom, the dog in the manger, the cat that swallowed the cream... A potato-like president, limp with murder, turns to his piquant attorney general and says,'I'd  give <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> for a thirteen-year-old nympho.' But the attorney general always replies,'No'No soap.' Always.''
Mcguane loyalists will read his new offering anyway, so the most immediate question surrounding ``Keep The Change'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houghton Mifflin</ENAMEX>, 230 pages, $18.95) is should the rest of us give this book a chance? The answer, with unmcguanean clarity, is yes.
The years seem to have mellowed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcguane</ENAMEX> some, and this book is surprisingly reader-friendly. The main character, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Starling</ENAMEX>, is neither an alky, a ne'er ne'er do well nor a sociopath. He went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> and became a commercially successful artist before he lost it.
The book, particularly early on, is full of wry wit and graceful depictions of family relations, first love and the stark beauty of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montana</ENAMEX> prairie.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>'s father, a rancher by birth, became a grimly suburban banker and moved the family from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> -- where he willed himself onto the golf course every weekend despite his obvious unsuitability for the sport. At times, he took young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> to visit the ranch he had held onto in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX>. After military school, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> returned to work for a summer on the ranch, where he lost his virginity, brooded over his love of the land and over his father's inability to love him. Dad, suffering from alcoholism and -- how appropriate -- diverticulitis, went bankrupt and was forced to turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX> ranch over to his spinster sister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lureen</ENAMEX>. Then he died.
When his painting career falls apart, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> heads to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, where he takes up with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> spitfire, improbably named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Astrid</ENAMEX>, whom he met while she was sitting atop a vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolls-Royce</ENAMEX> wearing nothing but gold spray paint en route to a costume party as a hood ornament. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> earns a meager living illustrating manuals that tell people how to use such gadgets as an electric cat feeder and an abortive ``portable secretary,'' that was supposed to do everything for ``her'' boss except you-know.
In the throes of passion with Astrid one afternoon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> improbably reaches out for the mail and discovers his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> card is about to be canceled. He then does what any of us would do in a similar situation, right? He steals <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Astrid</ENAMEX>'s car and heads off for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX>.
The absurd lengths to which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcguane</ENAMEX> goes to make his characters unpredictable can be, at times, annoying. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> meets his friend the gadget entrepreneur at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale Club</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, he runs into a beautiful woman, spends much of the night hitting on her, and when she finally invites him to have a drink with her, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> says, ``I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I don't know you.''
Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> gets a letter from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Astrid</ENAMEX> saying she hates him for stealing her car. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> writes back, ``God made women because sheep can't cook,'' and next thing we know, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Astrid</ENAMEX> shows up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX> with all her belongings.
It is back in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX> where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcguane</ENAMEX> develops his richest characters and turns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> into a likable, although pathetic character. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joe</ENAMEX> is seeking something of substance in his life and the romantic innocence he recalls from that pre-college summer, so he agrees to run a herd of cattle on the ranch for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aunt Lureen</ENAMEX>.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>'s quest runs up against a pair of beguiling characters whose surface simplicity belies their powerful determination to achieve their thoroughly selfish ends. At least, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcguane</ENAMEX> seems to be saying, they know what they want.
There is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>'s first love, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Overstreet</ENAMEX>, a fresh-faced schoolteacher who is unhappily married to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX>'s boyhood enemy Billy, and who seems to be reaching out to touch someone, and not long distance either. Then there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lureen</ENAMEX>'s brother and housemate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Smitty</ENAMEX>, damaged goods since World War II, seemingly lost in a sea of alcohol and calls to arms, padding around their old house in his smoking jacket, howling at the moon, fearing phantom air raids, railing against President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcguane</ENAMEX>'s ending is crafty, but it leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe</ENAMEX> as ever, another chapter in his life complete, without a clue as to the next page. The ambiguity is maddening, but in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcguane</ENAMEX>'s view of things, that's life.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swartz</ENAMEX> is a page-one editor for the Journal in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
