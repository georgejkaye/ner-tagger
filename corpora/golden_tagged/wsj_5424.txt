A disagreement over an arcane corner of the software world sparked a public argument among three of the most influential figures in computer publishing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Warnock</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> has a stranglehold on software essential to computer publishing, kicked off a round of insults at a major industry conference here. His voice cracking with emotion, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> told a crowd of more than 500 insiders that a competitor's plan to move into his business was ``the biggest bunch of garbage and mumbo jumbo I've ever heard in my life.''
Seated next to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> on the dais was his new nemesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Inc.</ENAMEX> On Tuesday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> to come up with an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s widely used way of insuring consistency of typefaces and fonts across diverse computer systems. Yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>, arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s dominance could stymie innovation, asked, ``Would you just want one standard for everything? Wouldn't you prefer two?''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Jobs</ENAMEX>, who is credited with launching computer publishing when he decided to pair laser printers equipped with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s software and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX>'s Macintosh, quickly offered an answer. On the dais to pitch the merits of his new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Next Inc.</ENAMEX> computer, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> came down squarely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s side.
Referring to the proposed software from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>, he said, ``There's no new technology here.'' The only reason Apple joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, he added, was because Apple ``made a mistake, a big mistake'' in deciding to use an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s method of producing fonts. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX>'s Next computer uses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s software both to display type and to print it.
Yesterday's outburst reflects how emotional computer executives can grow over seemingly bewildering technical points.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> has built Adobe into one of the most profitable software concerns on the strength of an innovative approach to computerized printing and the ability to persuade the leading makers of desk-top computers to adopt his system.
Meanwhile, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> frequently has used his clout as head of the world's biggest producer of personal computer software to pressure competitors into actions that benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. Recently he's been frustrated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s unwillingness to share key technical information that will help competitors clone fonts and other critical software used in computer publishing.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> once again got his way. After lambasting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> said that by March, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> would provide to all comers the secret specifications to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s font format. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> called that ``a positive step,'' and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> said he had taken it only because of pressure from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>. The two men have been negotiating the matter for several months.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> said the new policy on fonts won't hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s revenue in the short term, but the firm's stock slipped 37.5 cents to $19.75 a share in national over-the-counter trading on fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s share of the printer software business will decline. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s stock has been hammered since July when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s largest customer and shareholder, said it would sell its 16% equity holding and compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> by developing a clone of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postscript</ENAMEX>, its printer language.
However, the cloned software, now to be produced jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, won't be available until next year, and for the moment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s business is strong. Earlier this week the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mountain View</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, concern reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $9.1 million, up 42%. Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 1, was $30 million, up 19% from a year earlier.
When the public feuding ended, the insults continued in private. Asked whether he felt his criticism was too harsh, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX>, his voice calm, disagreed and criticized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>'s ideas.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX>, however, was more forgiving, describing his exchange as ``all in the normal give and take of business. I don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> was out of line.
