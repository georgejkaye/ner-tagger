The nominee for chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, concerned about brokerage firms' debt levels, wants the agency to have ``explicit authority to monitor'' the leverage at those firms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX>, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s pick for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> post, also said he supports halving the 10-day period for filing 13D statements, in which holders of a 5% or larger stake in a company disclose their holdings and their intentions. He also would institute a standstill period during which the buyer couldn't acquire more shares until the 13D filing has been made. But he doesn't support a proposal to reduce the 13D filing threshold to 3%.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> made the comments in written answers to nearly 200 questions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX>, which is expected to recommend his confirmation soon. The answers give the first real glimpse at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>'s prospective agenda as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> chairman.
In his answers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> emerges as a regulator who would seek tougher fines for securities-law violations, would allow banks more leeway to run securities firms and wouldn't seek to give the agency the right to close the securities markets in an emergency.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> shows his concern over brokerage firms -- especially their so-called bridge loans, the short-term financing often provided by investment houses to facilitate leveraged buy-outs.
Currently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> monitors capital levels of broker-dealers. Most firms, however, set up holding companies to issue bridge loans, because those hefty loans would drop capital below required levels. The commission is powerless to determine debt levels, although agency staffers say the firms have been willing to share the data when asked.
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> staffers want to monitor the information on a steady basis. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>, a veteran of the savings-and-loan bailout, concurs. ``I believe that it is imprudent for the commission to be unable to determine the degree of risk of such circumstances and the threat they represent to investor confidence and the financial system as a whole,'' he wrote.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> worries about the link between a broker-dealer and the affiliated company. ``Sudden collapse'' of the affiliate, he said, ``could cause nearly instantaneous collapse of the broker-dealer's liquidity resources, with potentially enormous impact on the integrity of the market.'' He said he would consult the industry to ensure that there wouldn't be ``unnecessary costs or unnecessarily expanded regulation.''
In another debt matter, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> agreed with senators' contention that U.S. tax law encourages the substitution of debt for stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs. ``Ultimately I believe that the current tax provisions that penalize the use of equity capital by U.S. corporations should be altered,'' he said.
On other issues, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> offered these views:
-- Little relief is likely for corporate bondholders in takeovers. After the buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>, bondholders screamed as their issues plummeted. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>, showing his free-market bent, offered little solace. ``A bondholder's rights are purely a matter of contract,'' he said. ``Thus a bondholder is treated `fairly' if he or she receives what was bargained for.'' He said he expects the market to respond to the added risk by changing some of the protections.
-- On the prospect of stiffer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> penalties, he said, ``The potential of serious fines could serve as a powerful deterrent to unlawful activity.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> also would consider rules giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> cease-and-desist authority similar to that of banking regulators.
-- On support for limiting ``poison pills'' and ``golden parachutes,'' he said that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> in the past has deferred to state law on both issues, he is ``not unsympathetic'' to requiring shareholder votes to enact poison pills, which discourage hostile takeovers, and golden parachutes, which provide large payouts to executives in the event of a takeover.
-- On repeal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glass-Steagall</ENAMEX> Act, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s current position, which favors eliminating rules separating commercial banking and investment banking. ``I do not know of any aspects of the securities business that should be unlawful per se for banks,'' he wrote. He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> should be in charge of regulating banks' securities activities and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank Company Holding Act</ENAMEX> should be modified to allow non-banking financial companies to acquire banks without falling under the jurisdiction of that act.
-- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> said the regulation system could be strengthened by improving coordination among regulators. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> ``should try to develop mutually acceptable proposals to define product and jurisdictional lines,'' he said, and the lack of clarity in determining jurisdiction ``does adversely affect <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> competitiveness.''
But in response to a question from committee Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Riegle</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>), he said margins for securities and futures needn't be uniform. Margin changes, if any, should be set by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, he said.
