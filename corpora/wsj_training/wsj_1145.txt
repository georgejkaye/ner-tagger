<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast Utilities</ENAMEX> raised its bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection, to $2.25 billion from $1.85 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>'s raised bid, which was supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s official shareholder committee, is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company, the largest utility in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>.
The $2.25 billion value claimed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, is the highest yet given to a bid. Some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow, a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge. A hearing is set for Nov. 15, but participants don't expect a resolution until July 1990.
Under the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast Utilities</ENAMEX> plan, it would pay $1.65 billion in cash to creditors and assume $100 million in pollution control bonds. Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest, while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January
The biggest change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>'s offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously. Assuming full operation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seabrook</ENAMEX> nuclear power plant, which is completed but isn't yet operating, equity holders would receive up to $500 million in cash, preferred stock and new 10-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seabrook</ENAMEX> bonds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>'s previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $165 million.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> promised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> that rate increases would be limited to 5.5% annually for seven years. Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seabrook</ENAMEX> operations and other contingencies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Ross</ENAMEX>, financial adviser to the equity holders said, ``Given the state's strong bargaining position... we believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NU</ENAMEX> plan provides the best recovery available'' to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX>'s equity holders.
Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS of New Hampshire</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. The company has filed an internal reorganization plan it valued at $2.2 billion that would require 5.5% rate increases. That plan would leave existing preferred shareholders with at least a 41% stake and give common shareholders as little as 13%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Electric System</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westborough</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, has proposed buying the company for $2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8% annually for seven years. The state of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> has favored that plan.
The other bidder is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Illuminating Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Haven</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, with a bid valued at $2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5% rate increases.
