<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirk Kerkorian</ENAMEX>, fresh on the heels of agreeing to sell his movie studio for $1.5 billion, now plans to build a movie theme park and 4,000-room hotel/entertainment complex in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>.
The project, which was announced by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX>'s 97%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand Inc.</ENAMEX>, would cost about $700 million, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Benninger</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> Grand is considering locating the park on 143 acres it just purchased for $28 million. The land is adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Desert Inn Hotel & Casino</ENAMEX>, which MGM Grand bought in 1987. The land, which includes the resort's golf course, has been owned since the 1950s by a private partnership, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert Associates</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benninger</ENAMEX> said.
Before it builds the complex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> said it needs to determine if it can use the name ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> Grand'' for the theme park as well as the new hotel. It filed a suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> on Sept. 6 in state court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> seeking a ruling on the issue. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> licenses the ``MGM'' name under a 1985 agreement it made with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX>, now called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>, which uses the name on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> Studios theme park in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, had already informed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX>'s attorneys it would fight any attempt to call a theme park ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand.</ENAMEX>''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX>, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> split off from the movie company in 1980, owns and operates a luxury airline. It has owned a number of hotels in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>: the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> Grand hotel, devastated by a 1981 fire, was sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally Manufacturing Corp.</ENAMEX> in 1986. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> recently sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sands Hotel & Casino</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> was involved in the building of what are now the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas Hilton</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flamingo</ENAMEX> hotels.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> has a long history with the desert gambling city: he began shuttling gamblers there in a surplus bomber after World War II.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> needs more than just gambling,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benninger</ENAMEX> said. ``It needs family entertainment.'' He added that the proposed hotel would be family-oriented and not as upscale as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Desert Inn</ENAMEX>. He described the park as ``a little bit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX>, a little bit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disney</ENAMEX>, and some new things we have in mind.'' The company has not yet hired designers, but a feasibility study is expected to be completed in six months, and a park could be built by late 1992 or early 1993.
The theme park business has been booming in recent years, but there are very few major players. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Disney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> build theme parks, the cost is at least $500 million. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benninger</ENAMEX> said the company was not anticipating that it would take partners in the venture.
Analysts say that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> is changing as more families and conventioneers flood into town. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> is already an adult theme park,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold L. Vogel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.</ENAMEX> ``This concept is just the logical extension.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis I. Forst</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Pacific Merchant Bank</ENAMEX> says there is little competition for family entertainment now beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circus-Circus</ENAMEX> resort. But he said the ``$64,000 question'' was whether people who go to a place to gamble will take time out to go to a theme park.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM Grand</ENAMEX> also said it had agreed to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> office building for $43 million from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications</ENAMEX> -- the entertainment company that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerkorian</ENAMEX> last week agreed to sell to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qintex Group</ENAMEX>.
