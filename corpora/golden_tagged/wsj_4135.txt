<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Diego Gas & Electric Co.</ENAMEX> said it filed suit to get another regulatory hearing concerning $28 million in disallowed electricity charges.
The suit, filed in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, challenges the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Public Utilities Commission</ENAMEX>'s rejection of the company's petition to rehear a decision it issued in February against the company.
In the February decision, the commission disallowed more than $28 million in past electricity charges by the utility. In denying the rehearing this month, the commission maintained that some legal error in its decision must be demonstrated, ``and no legal error was shown.'' The decision concerned certain power transmitted in 1984-86.
Spokesmen at the commission didn't have any immediate comment on the suit.
