The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>\ truck-maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF N.V.</ENAMEX> said it has submitted an offer to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>'s state-owned Empresa <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nacional de Autocamiones</ENAMEX> S.A. Terms weren't disclosed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX> said it was one of four companies whose bids were invited and now are being considered by the Spanish truck-maker's parent Instituto <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nacional de Industria</ENAMEX>, the big state industrial holding company that has a publicly stated policy of cutting back its substantial massive holdings in Spanish industry.
The other three bids include a joint offer from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz AG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAN AG</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIAT S.p. A.</ENAMEX>'s truck affiliate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iveco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB Volvo</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX> official said it isn't clear when the Spanish government will make a final decision on the winning bid.
Should it win the auction for the Spanish concern, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAF</ENAMEX> would become <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s third largest truck-maker, behind <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iveco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Daimler</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> truck division.
