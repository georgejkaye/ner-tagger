The mass emigration of thousands of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germanys</ENAMEX>.
No one is predicting a date for a possible reunification. Proponents acknowledge the risks of assuming too much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> reform trends, and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>. Yet growing signs of ferment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> have given Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX>'s government reason to consider the possibilities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Lintner</ENAMEX>, parliamentary speaker on German affairs for the joint Christian Democrat and Christrian Socialist caucus in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bundestag</ENAMEX>, said his committee has placed reunification on its October agenda. He said the sessions, which will include government officials and outside experts, hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s Western allies, particularly the U.S.
``It has become clear to the world that the Communist system in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> is in trouble,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lintner</ENAMEX> said. ``The time has come for us to show our allies, but also reform-minded people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX>, that German reunification is no longer just a theory but a subject requiring a serious appraisal of how it could come about.''
``There are still a number of imponderables,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linter</ENAMEX> conceded. ``For instance, we want the federal government to approach our allies and get their thoughts on the reunification topic.''
The U.S. ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon A. Walters</ENAMEX>, earlier this month reaffirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s policy of supporting a German reunification based on free, democratic elections. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walters</ENAMEX> caused a stir by predicting that reunion could occur in the relatively near future.
Emerging opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> has raised questions on how long <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX>'s leaders can resist the democratic reforms sweeping through neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> countries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reforms</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and even the Soviet Union have magnified East <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s Stalinist controls. Fledgling protest groups, and the influential Protestant church, have begun pressing for reforms in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> which, if allowed to include free elections, could eventually lead to a reunited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, according to some Western experts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dorothee Wilms</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX>'s cabinet minister for inter-German affairs, said in an interview in the newspaper Welt am  Sonntag that recent polls show that between 85% and 90% of all West Germans favor a reunifed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>.
``The desire for reunification, a feeling of togetherness, a sense of nationhood -- all this has strongly increased in recent years,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilms</ENAMEX> told the newspaper. ``The recent escape movement from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDR</ENAMEX> makes especially clear that people of both German states want to live free amongst themselves,'' she said, but cautioned that reunification can not occur overnight. The first step, she added, ``is the reform process in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDR</ENAMEX>.''
Most West German governments since 1949 have paid only lip service to the reunification goal set down in the preamble of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s constitution. Political realities have prevented the topic from becoming a serious issue. Analysts say that four decades of different systems would make reunification difficult. Further, many West German workers worry that a mass influx of East Germans could threaten their jobs.
Thousands of East Germans have emigrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austro</ENAMEX>-Hungarian border since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest</ENAMEX> ignored <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX>'s protests and opened its border. Close to 80,000 East German refugees have arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> so far this year, either legally or by escaping, and a total of more than 100,000 are expected by December.
The Soviets have joined <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX> in criticizing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> for welcoming the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German</ENAMEX> refugees, and chided <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> for violating an emigration treaty with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> by allowing them to leave.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>, which has tolerated reforms elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bloc</ENAMEX>, is said to be concerned by conditions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>, perhaps the most important of its Warsaw Pact satellites. Unconfirmed West German intelligence reports appearing in the West German media said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> fears a growing dissident movement and mass demonstrations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> by next year.
Soviet President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> accepted an invitation to attend <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>'s 40th anniversary celebration, providing an opportunity for serious discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Honecker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX>'s ailing party leader.
East <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s Communist leadership, commented the newspaper Frankfurter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allgemeine Zeitung</ENAMEX>, ``has no illusions as to why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is honoring their 40th anniversary. He certainly will not say'well  done, keep it up.'''
