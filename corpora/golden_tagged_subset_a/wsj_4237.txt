Merchant bankers don't often target ethnic groups' financial wherewithal, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry R. Silverman</ENAMEX> has gotten rich doing just that.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns of America Inc.</ENAMEX> has prospered by attracting Asian-American franchisees, particularly of Indian and Pakistani descent. And in the face of skepticism from potential advertisers, he has created a rapidly expanding TV network -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemundo Group Inc.</ENAMEX> -- for the Spanish-speaking community.
The 48-year-old investor portrays himself as an opportunist scrambling for a quick profit buying and selling companies. And he has found that identifying underappreciated minority groups is a speedy way to do that. ``I look for niches, and usually the niches you find are the ones that people don't want or are ignoring,'' he says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Capital Group Limited Partnership</ENAMEX>, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> leads, will soon close the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX> to its biggest franchisee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tollman-Hundley Hotels</ENAMEX>, for $190 million plus the assumption of $575 million of debt. The sale will earn $50 million for the investment firm, which took control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX> in 1984 and owns 65% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX>, its only holdings.
The profit will pay capital-gains taxes for the partners and provide added investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> also says he is likely to use part of the proceeds to make another acquisition, but he says he has ``nothing currently on the plate.''
Many Asian-American hotel owners are choosing to link up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gillette</ENAMEX>, the managing editor of the trade publication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel & Motel Management</ENAMEX>. About 30% of all U.S. hotels are owned by Asian-Americans, who are drawn to the business because it means control of real estate and employment for an entire family. Yet industry executives say that big hoteliers have considered Asians ``franchisees of last resort.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> has learned the hard way that marketing to Hispanics, even on a TV network designed specifically for them, isn't a priority of some major companies. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> told the chief executive of a big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> retailer that targeting Spanish speakers could increase cash flow. ``You're right,'' the executive said, ``but I don't want your people in my store.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> is undaunted by such attitudes. He has been doing deals almost since he graduated from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania Law School</ENAMEX> in 1964. At the small Wall Street investment firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladenburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thalmann & Co.</ENAMEX>, he started a corporate-finance department. Through his own firm, he put together investment partnerships and tax shelters. And with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> Capital, he spearheaded the acquisitions, stock offerings and junk-bond financings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX> -- which he later took private.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> acts like the prototypical deal maker. When he visits <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, the home of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> stays at the tony <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritz Carlton Hotel</ENAMEX>, shunning the mid-market Days Inn. (A light sleeper, he claims the company hotel is too near a busy highway.) Smoking oversized Cuban cigars -- sent via <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX> -- has cost him a table in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ritz</ENAMEX>'s main dining hall so often that he automatically takes a private dining room. Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael A. Leven</ENAMEX>, president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX>: ``Enormous cigars make him feel like a mogul or something.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> is a participative manager, aides say. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX> franchisees say he returns calls promptly and is a fair and quick decision maker. Yet personally, ``he keeps his distance; he rarely asks you how your kids are,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leven</ENAMEX>. ``He thinks he needs that kind of image.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Capital</ENAMEX> is an affiliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Group Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>, the insurance and investment firm controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul P. Steinberg</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Group</ENAMEX> holds 12% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Capital</ENAMEX>, which was established in 1983. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> is president, chief executive and a holder of less than 5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Capital</ENAMEX>, which also includes about 50 other investors. He is chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX>.
In 1988, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> garnered $1,063,000 as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Group</ENAMEX>'s senior vice president of business development, according to proxy material. He also reaped $2 million from options last year, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> Capital bought the shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX> it didn't already own.
Sensing a potential windfall of franchisee fees, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> induced many independent Asian-American hotel owners to build new hotels and convert existing properties to the chain. He touted the benefits of national marketing and doled out 20-year financing packages.
Now Asian-Americans hold 27% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX> franchises and franchise agreements, compared with 15% in 1987. Other minority groups aren't well represented, though, and most Asian-owned properties are concentrated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> notes.
``Words can not express what they have done for the Indian community,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonny Anand</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX>-born franchisee in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chattanooga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, who owns seven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX> and has agreed to build 10 more. ``But the Indian community has done a lot for them.''
At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX>, where he is president and chief executive, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> concentrates on budgeting, leaving broadcast decisions to Hispanics in the company. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Hispanic Media Coalition</ENAMEX> has charged that Hispanics aren't given enough senior-level responsibilities. After meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles group</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> announced that a third Hispanic director will join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX>'s 11-member board.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX> was formed around a TV station Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> owned in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and two independent Spanish-language stations acquired in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Capital</ENAMEX>'s 1986 takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Blair & Co.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> is counting on marketers rethinking their strategy and regularly advertising on the all-Spanish network. Their reluctance to advertise so far has kept ad rates very low.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX> isn't expected to earn a quarterly profit for ``another year or two,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX>. Its major competitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Univision Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>, has eight stations to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX>'s seven and will also remain unprofitable for a few years, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Univision</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. William Grimes</ENAMEX>. Each of the networks will add another station this year. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Univision</ENAMEX>, which is 80% held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hallmark Cards Inc.</ENAMEX> and 20% held by a venture capital arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Chicago Corp.</ENAMEX>, report ``positive cash flow,'' which they say better represents their strength.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortunately</ENAMEX>, the Hispanic market is concentrated,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> says, adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX> reaches about 75% of Hispanic households, compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Univision</ENAMEX>'s 85%. About two-thirds of the nation's approximately 20 million Hispanics live in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX> says. Next year, in a project the two networks will fund, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dun & Bradstreet Corp's A.C. Nielsen Co.</ENAMEX> will begin providing ratings specifically for Spanish-language TV.
No one was surprised that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> cashed out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Days Inns</ENAMEX>. ``It was always on the block with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance</ENAMEX>,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillette</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotel & Motel Management</ENAMEX>. Nor will Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX> say how long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance</ENAMEX> will hold on to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telemundo</ENAMEX>, but he hints: ``You can't fall in love with your {operations} when you are in the used-car business.
