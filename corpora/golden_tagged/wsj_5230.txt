The television units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> said they formed a joint venture to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies.
By pooling shows previously sold individually by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>, the new venture, Premier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Advertiser Sales</ENAMEX>, will account for about one-quarter of the estimated $1 billion in advertising billings for syndicated shows, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucie Salhany</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Domestic Television</ENAMEX>.
The formation of Premier had been expected by the broadcasting industry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> have other partnerships, including cable channel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Network</ENAMEX>. Prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Premier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> had a joint advertising sales venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orbis Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Advertising Sales.</ENAMEX> Under the agreement, the new company will continue to represent Orbis shows.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelly Schwab</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA TV</ENAMEX>, said the two companies complement each other with their programming. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> specializes in one-hour shows, including ``Star <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trek</ENAMEX>: The Next Generation,'' ``Friday the 13th: The Series'' and the weeknight ``Arsenio Hall Show.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conversely</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX> has a roster of family-oriented half-hour shows, such as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lassie</ENAMEX>,'' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX> in Charge'' and ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munsters</ENAMEX> Today.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX> said the new company will be the fifth-largest seller of advertising time in the broadcasting industry, behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>
Among syndicators, the nearest competitor is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Camelot Entertainment Sales</ENAMEX>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King World Productions Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buena Vista</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX>
