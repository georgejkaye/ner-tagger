A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference approved a nearly $17 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State, Justice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> bill that makes federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1.
The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of approximately $1.25 billion is paid. The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments, but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988.
The action came as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> sent to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $156.7 billion for the Departments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor, Education</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>. Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women.
Reversing an eight-year federal policy, the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother's life is in danger. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House, but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill.
The measure before the conference yesterday funds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Departments of State, Justice and Commerce</ENAMEX> through fiscal 1990. An estimated $1.32 billion is provided for next year's census, and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens.
Elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX>, nearly $191.2 million is preserved for assistance programs under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Development Administration</ENAMEX>. And in a footnote to the fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wright</ENAMEX> this year, the conference voted to rescind $11.8 million in unspent EDA funds for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader.
Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies, and an 18% increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>'s budget would be financed entirely by an added $26 million in filing fees. In an unprecedented step, the measure anticipates another $30 million in receipts by having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of</ENAMEX> Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> costs in processing personnel and security clearances.
The bill doesn't include an estimated $1.9 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>. But yesterday's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled 50% increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants.
Similarly, the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> a minimum allocation of $1.6 million each in drug grants, or three times the current minimum.
The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures, and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $1.5 million for a fish farm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> to a music festival in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Information Agency</ENAMEX>. Lawmakers scrapped all of a $7.4 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> request for the 1992 Expo in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, but agreed elsewhere to $15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Burger</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Commerce Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Hollings</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>), who also chairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> appropriations subcommittee for the department, attached $10 million for an advanced technology initiative, including work on high-definition television. His Republican counterpart, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Rudman</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.H.</ENAMEX>), has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal Services Corp.</ENAMEX>
An estimated $321 million is provided to maintain the program, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudman</ENAMEX> also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed. The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year, and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food Research and Action Center</ENAMEX>.
The bill also provides $620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and $80 million for peace-keeping activities. Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989, although the amount for peace-keeping shows a 27% cut from the administration's request.
