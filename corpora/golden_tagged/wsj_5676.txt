Armed with a machete, Eastman <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colby H. Chandler</ENAMEX> marched into a meeting with his top 75 managers last month and began whacking away at a wooden crate.
His subordinates were dumbfounded. Usually, the diminutive Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> emphasizes a point with intricate graphs, and he rarely raises his voice. But after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s second-quarter profit plunged 85% -- and shocked Wall Street -- only a tantrum, a vivid demonstration of how he wanted to cut costs, would suffice. ``There's no working the middle course in wartime,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> asserted, borrowing a line from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX>.
The 64-year-old executive, embarking on his fourth restructuring of the company in six years, knows that it is his last chance to prove his leadership before he retires next May. Already, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> watchers are shaking their heads, wondering why he needs four tries to accomplish essentially one job: cut costs. Is he simply the leader of a gang that can't shoot straight? they ask.
``He's a considerate and sincere person, but he doesn't have the creativity and adaptability needed in today's markets,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Paul</ENAMEX>, a business professor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochester Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>.
Even Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX>'s chief lieutenants say that past restructurings, while yielding significant improvements, didn't go far enough. ``We're getting criticized by people who say,'We've heard this all before,' and ask,'Why haven't we delivered?' There's some justification for that,'' says President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay R. Whitmore</ENAMEX>. Indeed, a decision last month to tie annual bonuses to profits rather than to dividends on common stock was first proposed in 1986.
Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Phillip Samper</ENAMEX>, says, ``We have to be tougher. Our costs are still too high.'' Although the company's cost structure has improved, sales per employee last year totaled only $140,000, far below the $380,000 at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s chief competitor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji Photo Film Co.</ENAMEX>, analysts say.
But does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> still have enough time to rein in expenses? The plan announced last month includes elimination of 4,500 jobs and disposal or restructuring of 20 businesses with $1.25 billion in annual sales; it is designed to generate $1 billion in operating savings in 1990. But it hasn't dispelled persistent takeover rumors. Some analysts and investors consider <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s stock to be greatly undervalued, given the total value of its assets. Analysts say the company would fetch at least $75 a share in a takeover, compared with the $47.75-a-share closing price on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday.
Wall Street is buzzing with talk of possible raiders, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX> -- although a source close to him says ``he hasn't owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> in years.'' In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>, with 324.2 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of about $16.2 billion, would be a huge chunk to swallow. ``But it has great break-up value and a stellar name,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> money manager.
The takeover talk is likely to intensify after a federal judge determines, in coming months, the size of the settlement in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polaroid Corp.</ENAMEX>'s successful instant-camera patent suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> could get a multibillion-dollar bill for damages -- a fact that has acted as a poison pill, discouraging takeover attempts.
For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX>, the job of making elephant-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> dance has been painful and frustrating. It has required ripping apart a 100-year-old culture that guaranteed lifetime employment but fostered complacency. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> had monopolized photography for so many decades that many managers didn't worry about competition -- or mistakes.
After becoming chief executive six years ago, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> didn't dally. The methodical engineer set up more than a dozen business units, forced middle managers to make decisions, demanded shorter product-development cycles and even trimmed cafeteria hours. Some results were gratifying: A color copier went from design to manufacturing in 22 months. And a color film introduced this spring is widely considered the best in the world.
Last year, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> posted record profit of $1.4 billion, its managers believed that tough times were over. They were mistaken; in the 1989 first half, net slid 60% as operating earnings declined in most of the company's businesses.
Critics blame Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> for not shrinking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s size in one radical restructuring. Although the entire company was reorganized in 1984 into smaller divisions to make them more efficient, that wasn't enough to avoid a 10% work-force reduction and a 5% budget cut in 1986. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> said earlier this year that it would slash costs for support services by 15% by 1990, only to embark on the fourth restructuring last month.
The repeated rounds of cutbacks, some observers say, have demoralized employees and still not done the trick. In spite of the cuts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s employment, at 145,300, is still at a peak because of a spate of acquisitions. And bloating of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s payroll sometimes seems apparent: At a recent meeting about a small legislative matter involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Drug</ENAMEX> unit, for example, Sterling's two managers were outnumbered by 22 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> staffers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disgruntled</ENAMEX> employees recently called for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX>'s resignation in letters to the editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>'s daily newspapers. ``Perhaps it is time for you to move on and let someone else straighten up the  mess,'' wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Powless</ENAMEX>, an employee at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elmgrove</ENAMEX> plant.
Others recommend the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Welch</ENAMEX> approach at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> Asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Ouellette</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Drug</ENAMEX> executive: ``Divisions should have to defend why they should be kept. If you want to make motors, you have to show how you can deliver a 13% profit increase. If you can't, we'll get rid of you. It's pretty hard stuff, but a big company like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> has to go through it.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX>, who fondly calls his employees members of the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> family,'' consciously avoided wholesale cuts. ``How big a change can you make without destroying everything in the process?'' he asks. The executive, who grew up on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> dairy farm, is especially protective of both the company employees and the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>. ``There is not a family in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX> that isn't touched by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> in some way,'' he says.
Unlike a Manhattan executive who never has to face laid-off employees, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> is often greeted by managers on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>'s streets with a wave and a ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colby.</ENAMEX>'' ``I agonize about every single dismissal from the company,'' he declares.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s diversification binge culminated in its $5.1 billion takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Drug</ENAMEX> last year. The camera and film company now also makes such unlikely products as artificial snow, floppy disks and aspirin. But top executives admit that they need to cull their lines of business and narrow their focus. ``We have an accumulation that we shouldn't have built up,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> says.
At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> has been reluctant to shed products with little growth potential. For example, the carousel slide projector, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> innovation that is experiencing slow growth, doesn't generate big profits, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> is reluctant to part with it. ``I have a soft spot in my heart for it,'' he explains.
And how could Kodak lightly abandon motion-picture film, even though the product's long-term growth is threatened by videotape and high-definition television? Years ago, movie makers sought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s help in improving film; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> responded, and shelves lined with Emmy and Oscar awards hail its achievement. ``There's only one Kodak in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Larish</ENAMEX>, a former employee. ``People expect them to continue doing certain things.''
Certainly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> faces a dilemma hamstringing many American conglomerates: It must hold down prices or risk losing market share to foreign competitors. But, at the same time, investors are demanding hefty returns now.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>, which once set prices at will on everything from film to flash-cubes, has been forfeiting increases to stave off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> and others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Competition</ENAMEX> has been especially fierce in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s key color print film and photographic-paper businesses. That partly explains why earnings couldn't keep pace with the healthy 9% growth in volume this year.
``Nothing in this world is simple anymore,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> says, adding: ``You pay a terrible price to buy market share back.''
Yet, at times, top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> executives have ignored competitors' strengths. When a manager began tracking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fuji</ENAMEX>, he discovered that the Japanese company had been quietly licensing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> technology from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s patent attorneys, who didn't inform senior executives. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> also had a more efficient inventory system in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> warehouses stocked almost all its products, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> relied on overnight air shipments, which increased freight expenses but sharply reduced inventory costs and delivery times.
After he presented his findings about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fuji</ENAMEX> to senior management, however, the manager, who has since left the company, says he was told never to talk about it again. ``The message was,'We'We don't want to hear that story,''' says the departed manager, who doesn't want to be identified because his wife works at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>. The company declines comment on the incident.
Nor did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> always listen to its employees in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, who urged the company to assimilate Japanese ways. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> insisted on imposing its U.S. work policies and refused to offer standard Japanese benefits, such as housing assistance, according to a former Japanese manager. And until 1985, the print on its familiar yellow film boxes was in English. The result: Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> has gained 13% share of the Japanese color print film market, employee turnover is high, and Japanese consumers' acceptance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> products is slow.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> acknowledges that it has broken ``with some Japanese traditions in terms of office layout and uniforms'' and says its housing assistance isn't as high as other employers' or even offered in all cases. However, it believes that its salaries are generally higher and that it offers an attractive benefit package.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitmore</ENAMEX> says the battle in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> was ``lost by not being there earlier.'' Until five years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> executives rejected as too costly opening offices in the world's second-largest photographic market. ``The best we can do now is fight it out,'' he says. ``We want to make them fight for every share point they got.''
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> missed the mark in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, the jury is still out on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX>'s biggest, boldest move -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Drug</ENAMEX> acquisition. That shocked investors who liked blue-chip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> for studiously shunning high debt -- and all the more because Sterling promises slight short-term returns.
The drug company does provide an entry into the fast-growing pharmaceutical business, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> stock has yet to rebound to pre-Sterling highs. ``We won't know for sure if we did it right {buying Sterling} for another five years,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitmore</ENAMEX> says, noting that it takes at least that long to get new drugs on the market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Absorbing Sterling</ENAMEX> hasn't been easy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sterling</ENAMEX>'s top managers for their marketing savvy and knowledge of drugs, but within a year most of them left. Among them was the highly regarded former chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Pietruski</ENAMEX>. Colleagues say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pietruski</ENAMEX>, who declines comment, felt slighted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s refusal to give him a board seat.
``Pietruski would have been a big help to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colby</ENAMEX>. He's the kind of guy who sees things as they are and not as they want them to be,'' a Sterling manager says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> executives say they expected management resignations but weren't prepared for problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling's</ENAMEX> flagship product, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayer</ENAMEX> aspirin. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayer</ENAMEX> would take off on reports that aspirin helps heart patients. ``We didn't understand the business,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitmore</ENAMEX> says. ``The big part is,'I've got a headache,' and that's very competitive.''
To <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>, even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayer</ENAMEX> is a minor headache compared with the migraine that hit when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> realized how badly things were going this year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s first half ended just a month after the company's annual meeting in May where -- right before giving shareholders free lunch and cholesterol checks -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colby</ENAMEX> optimistically predicted a record 1989.
Although he says he was ``surprised'' by the pervasiveness of problems, red flags were flying since the beginning of the year. But subordinates assured top executives that they could ``turn it around,'' Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samper</ENAMEX> says. Such was the case in information systems, where operating profits plunged 93%, after new high-tech products stalled and oversupplied customers cut orders.
Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> is telling its employees: Be productive, or you are out. But how seriously the company means that isn't clear. Rather than making hard-nosed decisions about who will go in the 4,500-employee cutback, the company is seeking voluntary resignations with generous severance packages. ``I don't sense a lot of fear, even after the latest announcement,'' says a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> manager and now a consultant.
In addition, securities analysts are already saying they don't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s profit to improve this year. They are lowering their second-half estimates in anticipation of declines in operating profits in all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>'s major business segments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Henderson</ENAMEX> reduced his 1989 forecast to $3.60 a share from $3.70 a share, and says that may still be too high. In 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> earned $1.4 billion, or $4.31 a share, on sales of $17.03 billion.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> has only nine months before his retirement to turn things around, a time pressure that could explain his resort to machete dramatics at meetings. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitmore</ENAMEX> explains: ``We're saying to managers,'Watch me throw a tantrum,''' in hopes that ``they'll finally understand we're serious.''
