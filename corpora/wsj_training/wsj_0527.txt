<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crossland Savings Bank</ENAMEX>'s stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crossland</ENAMEX> may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7.

He added that final guidelines to be published in early November will determine whether the bank is in compliance.
