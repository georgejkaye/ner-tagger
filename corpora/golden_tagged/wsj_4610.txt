The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> contributed to the 1988 crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> jet by not moving forcefully to correct ``known deficiencies'' among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> flight crews.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 727 crashed Aug. 31, 1988, shortly after takeoff from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-Fort Worth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Airport</ENAMEX>. Fourteen people were killed. Federal investigators concluded almost immediately that the crew had failed to extend the plane's flaps and slats, perhaps because they were distracted by a flight attendant's extended presence in the cockpit before takeoff. Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> agreed that the flaps weren't properly set and fired three crew members.
Yesterday, as expected, the board blamed the accident primarily on ``inadequate cockpit discipline'' on the part of the captain and the first officer, which led to the incorrect setting of wing flaps and slats and prevented the aircraft from obtaining the needed lift. The other direct cause, the board said, was a malfunction in the takeoff-warning system which, if operating, would have alerted the crew to the fact that the flaps were retracted.
But fireworks at the all-day board meeting erupted over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> were in any way culpable for the accident. In 1987, after a string of serious errors by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> pilots, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> uncovered significant problems involving the crews, and urged sweeping changes in the carrier's cockpit procedures, pilots' manuals and training programs.
The airline did make some changes, but some safety board staff members contended that the progress was glacial and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> defaulted in its duties by failing to set a deadline for the improvements. These aides argued that the actions -- or lack of them -- by the airline and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> were direct causes of the accident, and their view was shared by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Burnett</ENAMEX>, a member of the board.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kolstad</ENAMEX>, acting board chairman, asserted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> didn't contribute to the accident. ``I don't see how the federal government is to blame any more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> state highway patrol is for the death of someone on the highway.''
After extensive haggling, the board members agreed on language saying that a contributing -- but not direct -- cause of the accident was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s ``lack of sufficiently aggressive action'' to ensure improvements in performance by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> crews.
Similar disputes dogged the issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> management. Again, some staff members argued that the management failed to make important safety changes in cockpit procedures and training until after the August 1988 accident, despite the 1987 criticism from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. The airline's failure to act, they said, should be cited as a direct cause of the accident.
One staff member, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Gorney</ENAMEX>, said, for example, that when a dozen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> pilots were interviewed after the accident about which crew member was responsible for visually checking whether the flaps were set correctly, ``we got four or five different answers.''
But board member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lauber</ENAMEX> contended that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> had, in fact, taken steps before the crash to improve crew performance. The compromise language finally approved said that a contributing cause of the accident was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>'s ``slow implementation of necessary modifications'' to its operations procedures, manuals and training.
The vote on the report was 4-1, with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burnett</ENAMEX> dissenting. He argued that the actions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and the airline were direct causes of the accident.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Pate</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> spokeswoman, said the company was pleased that its actions weren't cited as a direct cause. ``The board recognized actions that have been undertaken since the 1987'' FAA report, she said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> declined to comment except to say that it would carefully review safety board recommendations stemming from the accident.
