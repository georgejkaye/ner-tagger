The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ENAMEX> said it will start enforcing stiffer regulations Jan. 31 for so-called gray-market imports of vehicles.
The regulations, required under legislation enacted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> last year, will apply to imports of vehicles that weren't built to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government auto safety standards and were intended for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> or elsewhere abroad.
U.S. officials estimated that gray-market imports total about 2,100 units a year, a small part of the more than three million vehicles exported to the U.S. each year.
According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHTSA</ENAMEX>, the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that has registered with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government, or a person who has a contract with a registered importer, from permanently importing a vehicle that doesn't meet the U.S. auto safety standards.
The registered importer would be required to bring such vehicles into compliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> safety standards, compared with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them to meet the U.S. standards.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> tightened auto safety standards for gray-market imports after U.S. auto dealers, including franchised foreign-car dealers, complained that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars couldn't meet U.S. auto safety standards.
