The oil industry showed renewed interest in the sea off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX>, bidding 52.8 million Canadian dollars (US$44.9 million) for exploration rights on eight concessions totaling 926,612 acres.
The bids were in the form of work expenditure commitments. The area is near three oil fields including the large Hibernia field. The auction was conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canada</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board</ENAMEX>, a joint federal and provincial regulatory agency.
Successful bidders were Cygnus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mineral Corp.</ENAMEX>, a closely held Canadian concern; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petro-Canada Inc.</ENAMEX>, a Canadian government agency; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell Canada Ltd.</ENAMEX>; two Canadian units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX>; and a consortium of companies including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esso Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX>, Bow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell Canada Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Canada Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esso</ENAMEX> is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Oil Ltd.</ENAMEX> which is 70%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX> is about 71%-owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell Group</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Canada</ENAMEX> is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX>
Last year, there were fewer bidders at a similar auction. ``I'm pleasantly surprised'' with this year's auction, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newfoundland Energy</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rex Gibbons</ENAMEX>.
Drilling on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s east coast came to a standstill in May for the first time in more than a decade. But there are plans to resume drilling next year, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gibbons</ENAMEX> said there may be as many as five wells drilled in the next three years as a result of the auction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Angevine</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Energy Research Institute</ENAMEX>, said interest in exploration is being spurred by plans to develop the Hibernia field. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hibernia</ENAMEX> is expected to produce 110,000 barrels of crude oil a day starting in 1996.
Industry analysts are also predicting a good response to a planned offering of exploration rights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beaufort Sea</ENAMEX>, the first auction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Arctic</ENAMEX> in 20 years.
