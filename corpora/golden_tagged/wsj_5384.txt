<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ingersoll II</ENAMEX> is shedding his East Coast image for one that will play on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Main Street</ENAMEX>.
In recent months, the patrician chairman and chief executive officer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingersoll Publications Co.</ENAMEX> has dined frequently at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Club</ENAMEX>, joined the businessman's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noonday Club</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Press Club</ENAMEX>, and been asked to sit on the board of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Webster University</ENAMEX>.
By no coincidence, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX>'s burst of civic enthusiasm comes just in time for Monday's launch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Sun</ENAMEX>, his new daily newspaper. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>, a color-glutted tabloid, aims to break the monopoly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulitzer Publishing Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</ENAMEX> has had since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Globe-Democrat</ENAMEX> folded in 1986. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis magazine</ENAMEX> has dubbed the 43-year-old publisher the ``newest power in town.'' If he can become one of the few publishers to launch a successful metropolitan daily since World War II, he would challenge the long-held notion that big cities can't support two newspapers without joint operating agreements.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> faces tremendous odds. Not only is the 111-year-old Post-Dispatch entrenched, but it is fighting back with more editorial pages, new columnists and a new advertising campaign. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> has caused us to re-examine our business and we are ready,'' says Post-Dispatch publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Penniman</ENAMEX>. And while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> hopes to win over readers the liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Dispatch</ENAMEX> has alienated in this Catholic, conservative city, he says his target is the ``baby-boomers, active 25-to-44-year-olds'' -- largely a video generation that industry research indicates aren't heavy subscribers to daily newspapers.
``We aren't intending to be the second paper in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, we are a true alternative to the Post,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX>. ``The reason we will work is because we will be a family-oriented, local, conservative newspaper.''
To guide him through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s launch, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> took the unusual step of hiring Sawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller Group</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> political and media consulting firm that works often with clients in ``crisis'' situations, such as the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Miller</ENAMEX>, senior partner, talks about his client as if he were handling a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Congressman</ENAMEX>'s campaign. ``We've learned in democratic elections and with corporations what's important is to build a relationship of trust between product and the people,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> has shied from big-city competitive markets, in the past five years acquisitions have stretched the empire started by his father a half century ago to 40 dailies and 150 weeklies with estimated revenue of $800 million in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. He used $500 million from junk bonds underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> to finance the expansion.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> is known as a ``smooth and good operator'' of newspapers, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Morton</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch, Jones & Ryan</ENAMEX>. But, he adds, a highly leveraged company could ``feel the squeeze'' should there be a recession in the 1990s.
Compared with some recent acquisitions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> considers the $20 million launch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Sun</ENAMEX> a relatively low risk. But it is the venture in which he appears to be most deeply involved; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> will be the first Ingersoll paper to carry his name as editor in chief.
In recent months, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> has made himself and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s snappy logo ubiquitous in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nattily</ENAMEX> turned out in custom-made suits, suspenders, and aviator glasses, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> is in high demand on the city's civic-lunch circuit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s $2.5 million promotion campaign includes prime-time TV spots and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> ski cap giveaway at nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Busch</ENAMEX> Stadium.
So far, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> has made few if any missteps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Cavalli</ENAMEX>, senior vice president of advertising and sales promotion at Famous-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barr</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>'s leading department store, has seen his sales pitch. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> reflects his style: methodical and professional,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cavalli</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> is betting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> can lure readers who have drifted away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Dispatch</ENAMEX>. Only 35% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> households take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Dispatch</ENAMEX> during the week, and 60% on Sunday. In 1969, the total daily paid circulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Dispatch</ENAMEX> and now-defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Globe-Democrat</ENAMEX> was 652,261; in 1989, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Dispatch</ENAMEX>'s daily circulation was 378,225.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> believes he can win over readers with a newspaper that is a cross between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gannett Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> Today and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times Mirror Co.</ENAMEX>'s serious-minded tabloid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York Newsday</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> will carry two magazines for the weekend edition, a large sports-and-entertainment section, and a prime-time and cable TV grid in color across the centerfold of the paper.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX> will enter the market with 100,000 circulation, about one-fourth the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Dispatch</ENAMEX> but a level at which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> says he can make a profit. He cut start-up costs by using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suburban Journal</ENAMEX> chain of 43 giveaway newspapers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> suburbs to distribute the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s charter subscription offers. A week before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s first issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> has more than 46,000 paid home subscribers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s big innovations include a big weekly paper on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saturdays</ENAMEX>, not Sundays, and elimination of the rate differential between national and retail advertising.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> has hired away a number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Dispatch</ENAMEX>'s top staffers, some who say they initially feared Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> might publish a substandard tabloid. But, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Horrigan</ENAMEX>, the popular Post-Dispatch sports columnist Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> lured to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun</ENAMEX>'s lead columnist: ``We will be journalistically respectable. I've got his word on that.
