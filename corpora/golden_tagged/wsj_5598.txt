The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>, in a widely anticipated directive, called for ultrasonic inspections of the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> engine whose failure led to the crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> DC-10 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sioux City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>, last July.
The official announcement of the testing procedures -- an ``emergency regulation'' to determine whether the fan disk on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CF66</ENAMEX> engine contains any metallurgical imperfections -- came as DC-10 maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> testified before a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> panel on the airworthiness of the tri-jet.
In reiterating a stance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has taken since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sioux City</ENAMEX> accident that killed 112 people, Administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Busey</ENAMEX> told lawmakers: ``I believe it is important that I assure the public that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> considers the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DC</ENAMEX>-10 to be a safe aircraft. I would stress that we have no safety information which would cause us to consider grounding the aircraft, as some have asked.''
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> crash, the plane's aft engine exploded, spitting out metal and severing lines on all three of the jet's fluid-filled hydraulic, or control, systems. Investigators suspect the engine broke up after its 270-pound titanium fan disk -- still missing among the bean and corn crop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX> -- failed. The disk holds the fan blades in place.
Late last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> recommended to DC-10 operators that they install a shut-off valve on the No. 3 hydraulic system so that if all the lines were ever ruptured again, enough fluid would be retained for the pilot to maintain control and bring the craft to a safe landing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> is expected to make those changes mandatory soon.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said previously that the engine tests, which involve putting the three-foot-wide disks into a water chamber and bombarding them with ultrasonic waves, would cost the airlines a total of $10 million or more. But yesterday, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> spokesman said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, electrical products concern would assume the costs for the inspections, though he couldn't say what the dollar amount would be.
The tests, to be conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>, are limited to a certain type of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CF6</ENAMEX>-6 engine rotor disk, those made with the so-called ``double vacuum'' melt process. The first 55 engines must be examined by Nov. 21, and the remaining 165 inspections should be completed by Feb. 4.
In trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> closed at $57 a share, down 62.5 cents.
At the hearing before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> subcommittee on aviation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Warren</ENAMEX>, a vice president for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, commercial aircraft unit, explained that it was normal for aerospace companies to learn from accidents. ``It is and always has been our practice to continually improve our aircraft as long as they remain in production, and throughout their operating lives,'' he said.
But Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendell Ford</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>) said he'll be keeping a particularly close eye on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DC</ENAMEX>-10. ``They all gave the impression that it's safe,'' the subcommittee chairman said. ``But I'm not sure it is. I've still got a knot in the pit of my stomach.
