Federal drug agents here had identified a new cocaine gang by some of the usual signs: frequent contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> suppliers, flashy imported cars, no obvious legal income. But the agents didn't know the dealers' full names or where they lived, and gathering that information would cost valuable time.
So the feds turned to local police assigned to work with them on a joint task force. One <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> cop had gone to high school with some of the suspects and immediately provided names and addresses. ``With our own {computer identification} techniques, it would have taken much longer,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Johnson</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX>. Now the task force is watching the gang members closely and planning imminent arrests.
The federal-local team is one of the first operating units in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett</ENAMEX>'s war on drugs. It's part of the ``emergency plan'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> drug czar announced in April to combat <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s violent narcotics trade. The nation's capital, he declared, would be a ``test case'' for future efforts in cities such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
Nearly six months later, the test has yielded mixed results. By combining the expertise of two dozen federal agencies and area police departments, the task force has notched more than 130 arrests since June. Though it hasn't yet dented the city's drug problem, the 88-member group demonstrates that cops can set aside some turf battles and concentrate on catching pushers.
But apart from the enforcement team, some critics say, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bennett</ENAMEX> plan offers considerably less than it first appeared. For example, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> promised federal money to train teachers that would have been granted anyway. He also backed off building a new federal prison just for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
Local officials complain that his commitment to improve security in public housing turned out to be an empty gesture. All that federal officials have done, says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> public housing administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland Turpin</ENAMEX>, is ``put us in touch with people we knew anyway.'' Mayors and minority leaders have criticized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s efforts as inadequate. The Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Jackson</ENAMEX>, who has moved here and hints about running for mayor, recently attacked the drug czar before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, saying, ``We still have the emergency {in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>} but no comprehensive action.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> declines to comment until he issues a formal report next month. An aide says parts of the plan, such as building prisons, necessarily will take years. ``There's a tendency for people to expect a silver bullet right away,'' the aide contends.
Though focused only on nabbing criminals, the multi-agency enforcement team is considered a possible model for other cities. Led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX>, the task force brings together such talents as federal marshals' knack for tracking fugitives and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> cops' familiarity with local gang members' hangouts.
Pursuing defendants who jump bail has never been a strength of either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> or city police. ``Once we arrest the violator, we tend to want to move on to new investigations,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Ross</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> supervisor. U.S. marshals, though, specialize in finding fugitives and escapees. The problem, typically, is getting the paper work from arresting officers to the marshals. The process often takes months; defendants, meanwhile, slip away.
In response, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> task force established a special fugitive squad led by marshals. Using sophisticated telephone surveillance, the squad tracked a drug hit man wanted here to a girlfriend's apartment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> and arrested him there. In another case, the team used neighborhood informants to find and arrest two alleged leaders of what purportedly is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s biggest cocaine gang, just days before the group was put on trial this month.
The key to the task force's success appears to be Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s decision to give one agency -- in this case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> -- clear authority so that imaginative agents can solve bureaucratic problems. The task force swiftly set up its headquarters in southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> by routing $2.1 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> money through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arlington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, police department. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> supervisor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Mcmullan</ENAMEX> used the budgetary detour because the money-granting branch within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> technically can't give funds to another federal agency. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arlington</ENAMEX> was willing; we were in a hurry,'' he says.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX>'s eagerness to play a big role in the Bush administration's anti-drug program backfired in one case. Agents from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> task force, including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcmullan</ENAMEX>, concocted an undercover crack purchase in a park near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to provide a prop for a televised presidential speech. The staged ploy, designed to show that drugs can be bought anywhere, embarrassed the administration because many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> neighborhoods genuinely suffer from cocaine pushing. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> reported the incident last week, the suspect disappeared.
More important for the long term, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> hasn't eliminated all federal rivalries with the enforcement group. Although the drug czar said last month that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of</ENAMEX> Investigation had joined the task force, in fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> ``doesn't participate,'' because it doesn't want its agents reporting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX>, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcmullan</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> spokeswoman says that the bureau moved additional agents here, but she confirms that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> hasn't changed its policy of eschewing local cases.
This isn't the only example of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s advertising more than he has delivered. The drug czar said in an August document entitled ``Accomplishments to Date'' that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Department</ENAMEX> had agreed to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s federal grants by 50% for such things as drug-education training for teachers. About $1.4 million in new money did become available this summer, but the increase came from a previously planned 50% jump in such federal grants across the country. ``There was no special increase for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> schools,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Hays</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education Department</ENAMEX> drug policy administrator.
Similarly, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> promised that the federal government would build a 700-bed prison to ease <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s inmate glut. He quickly retracted that vow and instead says he will accelerate construction of a previously planned prison in western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> facility won't be completed for at least several years and even then won't necessarily take more convicts from the capital. Federal courts send inmates to facilities all across the country, depending on security needs. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> prisoners,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Bogdan</ENAMEX>, a federal prisons spokesman, ``may or may not'' end up in the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> prison. Acknowledges a sheepish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> adviser: ``Something got lost in the translation.''
The last three of the 10 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> prosecutors the drug czar arranged to have loaned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> arrived last week. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney here, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Stephens</ENAMEX>, points out that the new 20-lawyer narcotics unit Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> takes credit for in his ``Accomplishments'' report actually started before the drug czar took office.
