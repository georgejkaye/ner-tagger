<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron Corp.</ENAMEX>, only a week away from completing its $320 million acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen Corp.</ENAMEX>, pulled out, citing ``adverse changes'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> that it didn't anticipate.
Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> shares was suspended for several hours yesterday pending news of the termination. When composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading resumed, the shares sank to $18.375, down $5.25. The agreement called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> shareholders $25 a share.
In a statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> said it had told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> that it couldn't complete the merger because of changes in the financial performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> that weren't anticipated at the time of the agreement in April, ``and other factors which were not disclosed'' at the time. A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> wouldn't be more specific.
Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> is a closely held industrial electronics company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deer Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stamford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, is a maker of electronics, defense and industrial products. Among its more innovative products are a night-vision device for the military and frictionless bearings.
Vernitron fought a long, bitter battle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>, starting with a December offer to acquire the company for $20 a share. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> rejected that offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> first launched a $23-a-share hostile tender offer and proxy fight, then proposed a merger agreement at $25 a share.
In a seesaw battle through April, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> alternately entertained and resisted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX>'s $25-a-share offer. By the end of the month it reluctantly agreed, saying it couldn't find a better alternative.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX>, which said previously it had received financing commitments totaling $325 million for the transaction, faced a greatly increased debt load from the merger. The company was taken private in 1986 in a leveraged buy-out by a group led by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen W. Bershad</ENAMEX>.
Last week, a lessor of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> facility in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Commack</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, won a temporary court injunction blocking the merger. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mall Drive Associates</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> limited partnership, claimed the merger would violate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>'s lease agreement, because it would result in a company with lower net worth than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> has independently. A court hearing was scheduled for next week on Mall Drive's request for a permanent injunction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said she was aware of the Mall Drive complaint, but didn't think it it was a ``deal-blocker.
