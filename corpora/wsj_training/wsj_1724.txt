The federal response to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s earthquake crisis was marred by coast-to-coast name-calling between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Agnos</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos</ENAMEX> complained that he was ``ticked off'' that Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX>, who toured the earthquake site Wednesday, didn't schedule a private meeting with him. The mayor said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> visit was ``a publicity stunt.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX>'s staff had invited the mayor to two meetings of the vice president and groups of local officials and had offered to dispatch a helicopter to pick him up. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos</ENAMEX> declined the invitations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> press secretary, also asserted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos</ENAMEX> had failed to return telephone calls from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sununu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> chief of staff. ``We regret very much that the mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> has decided not to cooperate with us on this matter in making sure that there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fitzwater</ENAMEX> said.
By late yesterday, both sides appeared prepared to bury the hatchet. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> announced that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos</ENAMEX>, along with the mayors of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alameda</ENAMEX>, are to accompany President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> on a tour of the earthquake area today. And one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> official reported that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agnos</ENAMEX> had been ``very helpful'' in making arrangements for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s hastily  scheduled trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.
