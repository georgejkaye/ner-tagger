The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> officially cited Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Bates</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>) for sexually harassing two female employees, but didn't recommend formal disciplinary action.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> said he accepted the finding, but one of the victims, Dorena <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertussi</ENAMEX>, denounced the ethics panel's action as ``absurd.''
Acting more than a year after Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertussi</ENAMEX> filed a complaint, the panel issued a ``letter of reproval'' saying Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> had admitted conduct that violated a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> rule forbidding discrimination against employees on account of their sex. It ordered Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> to write letters of apology to Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertussi</ENAMEX> and to a second complainant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Dryden</ENAMEX>.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> said he would write the letters as ordered. ``I accept the resolution of the matter by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics Committee</ENAMEX>,'' he said.
The panel also warned Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> that any further violations ``may result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered.'' But Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bertussi</ENAMEX> asked, ``Who in their right mind is going to file another complaint with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics Committee</ENAMEX>?''
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> has publicly begged for forgiveness from voters and was re-elected with 60% of the vote last November.
