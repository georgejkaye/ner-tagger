<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan American World Airways</ENAMEX> announced that they and two Soviet partners will construct two ``world-class'' hotels within a mile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Square</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>.
U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-Soviet relations. ``This is an outstanding example of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> can work together for their mutual benefit and progress,'' said Soviet Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Dubinin</ENAMEX>, who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture's partners at the Soviet embassy here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mosbacher</ENAMEX>, who attended the ceremony, called the undertaking a ``historic step'' in the evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-Soviet ties. He added that it likely will have a ``mulitiplier effect'' in stimulating further trade between the two countries.
The project will be the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-backed joint venture to be undertaken in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> in recent years. One of the hotels, to be called the Sheraton <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>, will have 450 rooms and will cost an estimated $75 million to build. The six-story hotel will be on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gorky Street</ENAMEX> and initially will cater mostly to business travelers. It will have a Russian tavern, an English pub, a discotheque and Japanese and Italian restaurants, according to a Sheraton announcement. The hotel is scheduled to open in 1992.
The second hotel, to be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budapest Hotel</ENAMEX>, is to be constructed at a site even closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Square</ENAMEX>. Details about its size and cost haven't yet been determined.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Corp.</ENAMEX>, will have a 40% share in the two hotels; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan American</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am Corp.</ENAMEX>, will have a 10% share. The Soviet owners will be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mossoviet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s city governing body, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aeroflot</ENAMEX>, the Soviet national airline.
Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> hotel, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton-Pan Am</ENAMEX> venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> to have as much as 50% foreign ownership.
U.S. companies account for less than 8% of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987. But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX> are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheraton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture. The Sheraton <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> will charge about $140 to $150 a day for each of its rooms, and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets, according to a Sheraton executive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Plaskett</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>'s chairman, said the U.S. airline's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot to jointly operate nonstop <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> flights. He said the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high-standard <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> hotels.
