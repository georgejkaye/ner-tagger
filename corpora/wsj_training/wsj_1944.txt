<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutual</ENAMEX>-fund czar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Templeton</ENAMEX> has put his money where his moniker is, pouring $1.4 million into one of his own funds, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Templeton Value Fund</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton</ENAMEX> owns shares in several of the 33 funds that his firm manages, but only in three of the 10 available to U.S. investors, according to filings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>. Those are Templeton Global Income, Templeton Emerging Markets and now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value Fund</ENAMEX>.
Why did he add the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value Fund</ENAMEX> to the list? Because he's very bullish on the emerging growth stocks that make up the fund's portfolio, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton</ENAMEX> said from his Bahamas hideaway.
``Emerging growth stocks haven't been popular in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> for years, they've been neglected,'' he said, and their prices often trail the market as a whole.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton</ENAMEX>'s 147,300-share purchase in the closed-end fund came before the U.S. stock market's plunge last Friday, but still proved slightly profitable.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton</ENAMEX> bought his shares in several separate purchases between Aug. 30 and Sept. 28, according to reports with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>. He bought at share prices ranging from $9.375 to $9.625. The fund closed yesterday in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading at $9.625, up 12.5 cents.
In addition, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Templeton</ENAMEX> received a dividend of 22 cents a share Oct. 5.
RIVER RUN: A senior vice president and a vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James River Corp.</ENAMEX> sold the majority of their shares in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Richmond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, paper-products concern in late August and early September, reports filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> show.
The executives, who got $30.88 a share for the stock, showed good timing. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James River</ENAMEX> shares closed at $28.375, down 12.5 cents.
On Sept. 6, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Joseph Sherry</ENAMEX>, the firm's senior vice president of employee and public relations, sold 4,000 shares, leaving himself with 1,062 shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James River</ENAMEX>. Including a sale of stock last February, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry</ENAMEX> has sold 88% of his stake in the company this year, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry</ENAMEX> declined to comment when asked about the sales.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Toney</ENAMEX>, a vice president, sold 1,500 shares Aug. 28. He still has 1,143 shares, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> files. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toney</ENAMEX> also declined to comment.
INTEREST-RATE PLAYER: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co.</ENAMEX> tops the companies portion of the accompanying Insider Trading table this week. Three of the utility's directors have at least doubled their holdings in the company since July.
The largest purchase was by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dudley Taft</ENAMEX>, who bought 4,400 shares for $125,075. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taft</ENAMEX>, who is also president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taft Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>, said he bought the shares because he keeps a utility account at the brokerage firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX>, which had recommended the stock as a good buy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> confirmed that it has had a buy recommendation on the stock for about two years.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cincinnati Gas & Electric</ENAMEX> is in good shape,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taft</ENAMEX> said, and utilities are ``a good investment because interest rates are going down.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taft</ENAMEX> paid an average of $28.43 for each share. The stock closed yesterday on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> at $28.75, down 12.5 cents.
The two other directors bought 1,000 and 1,900 shares, respectively, at prices between $28.15 a share and $28.75 a share, filings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> show. The two couldn't be reached for comment. A company spokesman said he couldn't explain their sudden bullishness. ``I don't know of any news or anything unusual happening here,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Stoecklin</ENAMEX>, director of media services.
