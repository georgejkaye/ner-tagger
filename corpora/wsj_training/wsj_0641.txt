<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee Corp.</ENAMEX> said it will spend $42 million to purchase land and relocate its ammonium perchlorate storage facility to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Clark County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nev.</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Henderson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nev</ENAMEX>.
The company said it will move the storage and cross-blending operations to a site 23 miles northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> to distance the operations from residential areas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ammonium</ENAMEX> perchlorate is an oxidizer that is mixed with a propellant to make rocket fuel used in the space shuttle and military rockets.
In May 1988, an ammonium perchlorate plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Henderson</ENAMEX> owned by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> unit was leveled by a series of explosions. After the explosion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee</ENAMEX> temporarily shut down its facility just south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> for a safety inspection. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee</ENAMEX> are the only two U.S. manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate.
When the plant was destroyed, ``I think everyone got concerned that the same thing would happen at our plant,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerrmcgee</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said. That prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerr-Mcgee</ENAMEX> to consider moving the potentially volatile storage facilities and cross-blending operations away from town.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee</ENAMEX> said it has purchased 3,350 acres from the federal government in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Clark County</ENAMEX> and plans to begin construction early next year. The new facility is expected to begin operations in early 1991. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Henderson</ENAMEX> plant will continue its other chemical operations, the company said.
