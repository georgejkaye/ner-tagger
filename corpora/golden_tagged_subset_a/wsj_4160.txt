<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scores</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valdez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, tourist businesses lost substantial revenue as a result of the March 24 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> Valdez oil spill, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> legislative report has concluded.
The finding contradicts some predictions that the 260,000-barrel spill by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> tanker, which made headlines around the world, would provide a short-term boost to the tourist economy of the scenic port on Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sound</ENAMEX>.
The report concludes that instead of being attracted by the spill, many potential visitors shied away from the town because of misconceptions that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valdez</ENAMEX> was ``awash in oil.'' Thus, while hotels, campgrounds and restaurants overflowed with workers arriving to clean up the spill, other traditional tourism indicators, including excursion boats, tour guides and museums, experienced declines in customers of between 33% and 75%, the report said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valdez</ENAMEX>, population 3,600, is accessible by highway from both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anchorage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairbanks</ENAMEX>, the state's two major cities. Yet drive-in traffic to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valdez</ENAMEX> musuem, for example, slumped from to 25,000 visitors this summer season from 38,000 visitors in 1988's. And while the town attracted 39 cruise ships to its port -- 10 more than in 1988 -- only 13,000 cruise passengers visited the museum this summer, down from 19,500 such visitors in 1988. The slump is an indication that ``far fewer passengers disembarked'' from the ships this summer, according to the report.
Even in cases where advanced bookings meant business as usual, the spill often disrupted normal tourist services and may negatively affect future bookings, the report went on. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Lethcoe</ENAMEX>, operators of a sailing charter service, told legislative investigators that they were unable to use 75% of their traditional anchorages in remote areas of Prince <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sound</ENAMEX> because of oily conditions or oil-spill treatment activities.
``Usually isolated locations were disturbed by aircraft and people'' while ``noise pollution'' on marine band radios from spill cleanup activities made monitoring marine channels difficult and unpleasant, the report stated.
