We read with interest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Tomsho</ENAMEX>'s Sept. 28 page-one article on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> (``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundance</ENAMEX> Kid Gets Little Respect Around Sundance''). Misunderstanding conversations with us, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomsho</ENAMEX> argued that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX>'s environmental views are at odds with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> residents. This may have been true 10 years ago, but times have changed, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> no longer stands out as an extremist. He has not changed, but those around him have. Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas, rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream, conservative Utahans.
Recently, some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX>, the League of Women Voters and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Rifle Association</ENAMEX> joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Utah</ENAMEX> Project. While <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> is not yet a haven for environmentalism, public views toward the environment have significantly improved. In one of the most conservative, Republican states in the entire nation, the greening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX>'s neighbors is the real story that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomsho</ENAMEX> missed.

If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> wanted to be accepted by the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>, he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power-plant construction, coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment, but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wasatch Range</ENAMEX> into a ski resort.
It astounds me he can rationalize his self-righteous and greedy actions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>. An excellent environmental actor he is.

Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX>, like it or not, is like a braking system on a runaway truck, kind of slowing it down into control. He's rich, famous and intelligent, and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> is slowing down a mindless, speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind.
Personally, I'm glad there are people like him around to slow down the profit takers, and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future, not caring about the long-range implications.
