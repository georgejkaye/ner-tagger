Appeal of Globalization
Globaliztion appeals to some industries a lot more than to others. The most global businesses, such as aerospace and consumer electronics, are driven abroad by big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R&D</ENAMEX> budgets, strong consumer brands or heavy capital spending. At the other extreme, utilities and financial services would rather stay home, as shown in this table of industries' revenues from outside their home market.
Why Go Global?
Chief executive officers around the world want to expand their businesses globally. But the U.S. executives seem least clear about the strategic benefits, as shown by the percentage of Ceos who cite each reason for globalizing as very important.

Where the Action Is
Many Ceos plan specific actions in the next 12 months to increase their companies' global scope.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jingoism</ENAMEX> isn't dead. American Ceos say the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has the leading technology in their industries. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aber</ENAMEX> nein,'' the Europeans reply; it's in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Japanese executives vote for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>; only the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> Rim Ceos graciously favor the U.S.
Toughest Competition
Foreign competition hasn't obliterated U.S. industry yet. When North American Ceos were asked to identify the home country of their toughest competitor, they generally answered the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. But the Japanese are gaining.
Site of Future Sales
Overseas markets beckon brightly for U.S. Ceos. They expect foreign sales to be a bigger part of their business mix in five years, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. But they aren't optimistic about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet bloc</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> will remain dominant.
Foreign chief executives are just as eager to expand their U.S. operations. If anything, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> Rim executives are a little more aggressive than the Japanese.
Waiting for a Payback
If there's one vital fact to know about Japanese industry, here it is. When it comes to building factories or making other capital investments abroad, Japanese managers are more patient than any other group.
Average payback period (in years):
Willingness to have longer payback:
Worldly Experience
Today's Ceos aren't quite cosmopolitans, but they know a bit about the world. European and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> Rim executives are the most worldly.

Opportunities From 1992
Ceos world-wide are upbeat about business opportunities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> moves to a unified marketin  1992. Percent who may change is likely or somewhat likely:
There's a lively debate whether a protectionist ``Fortresseurope'' attitude will emerge in 1992.
Ceos from around the world are concentrating their European expansion plans on a few countries -- with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> scoring surprisingly high. Percent who plan to increase theircompany 's presence in country:
