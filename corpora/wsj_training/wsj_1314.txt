Investors dumped stocks of big companies whose earnings fluctuate with the economy.
Many of those ``cyclical'' issues are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average, which fell 26.23 to 2662.91. Declining issues on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> outpaced advancers, 1,012 to 501.
Recession fears are springing up again among investors. Analysts say that the selling of cyclical stocks yesterday will be followed by a sell-off in shares of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets. In an economic slowdown, heavy debt loads reduce the flexibility of companies because cash that would normally be used to keep the company buoyant must be diverted to interest payments.
On the other hand, investors beat a clear path yesterday to blue-chip issues with proven earnings growth records. Among the 30 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials, they bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> and sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aluminum Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>. In another sign of slowdown fears, investors dumped technology shares.
Many money managers are bracing for a decline in stocks of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets. ``The junk bond market is being taken apart'' because of recession fears, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. David Mills</ENAMEX>, senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Company Advisers</ENAMEX>. ``Under this scrutiny, the first thing you do is sell your cyclical stocks and the second thing you do is sell your over-leveraged companies.''
In fact, much of the buying in blue chips yesterday was a pursuit of companies with lower debt levels. In a recent investment letter entitled ``Winners of the `Leverage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wars</ENAMEX>,' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Kerschner</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s investment policy committee, suggested that investors buy stocks of companies that have avoided loading up on debt.
``We're saying companies have to pay increasing attention to balance sheets,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerschner</ENAMEX>. He suggested that investors buy the shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Atlantic & Pacific</ENAMEX> Tea, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Baker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sara Lee</ENAMEX>. He said that all of these companies will be able to compete fiercely in an economic downturn. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s has long-term debt equaling 91% of shareholder equity currently, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerschner</ENAMEX> said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $2.6 billion below their real value.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> climbed 1 3/8 to 72 1/8; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s added 1 to 31 3/8, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> gained 3/4 to 130 5/8. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&P</ENAMEX> fell 1 1/4 to 57 5/8, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Baker</ENAMEX> gained 3/8 to 21 1/4. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> slipped 1/2 to 43 7/8, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sara Lee</ENAMEX> closed unchanged at 60 1/8.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX>' ``stub'' stock index of 20 companies whose debt is giant compared with shareholder equity, investors are already beginning to retreat from shares of debt-laden companies. From January to early September, the index of stub stocks -- the tiny portion of equity that's publicly traded following a recapitalization -- outperformed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s 500-stock index by about 20%. But starting in early September, the index started to slide and now stands about even with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> 500.
``Stocks that have a high default risk have started to underperform those stocks that have a lower default risk,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Sorenson</ENAMEX>, director of quantitative analysis at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers.</ENAMEX> ``Companies that have the  most exposure to the business cycle have underperformed since late last summer.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide</ENAMEX>, whose third-quarter earnings dropped about 35% from a year earlier and fell short of analysts' expectations, declined 1/2 to 24 1/2.

Growing pressures on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> real-estate market are affecting the thrift; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinnacle West</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Professional Investor Report it may consider filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if it can't reach an agreement with federal regulators to provide additional capital to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Merabank</ENAMEX>.
