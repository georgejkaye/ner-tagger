(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
TELEVISION AND THE RUSH TO <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SUBURBIA</ENAMEX>, two post-World War II phenomena, would eventually spell big trouble for big-city newspapers. Giants like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Randolph Hearst</ENAMEX> could hang on to a 26-paper chain but after he died in 1951, his heirs folded, merged or sold dailies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>. May 7, 1967, was a day of foreboding, particularly for afternoon papers, long the dominant force among daily newspapers.
On that day, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst</ENAMEX> lost his voice in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>, as did two other major publishers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripps-Howard</ENAMEX> chain and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hay Whitney</ENAMEX>.
The last gasp for all three was an afternoon paper called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World-Journal-Tribune</ENAMEX>, an eight-month old amalgam of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hearst</ENAMEX>'s afternoon Journal-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American and Scripp</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World-Telegram & Sun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>'s morning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herald-Tribune</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World-Telegram</ENAMEX> had been flagships of their chains and Jock <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trib</ENAMEX> was one of the most respected papers in the country.
All three papers had been plagued by falling and volume and rising labor costs. In desperation, they merged in 1966 into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World-Journal</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribune</ENAMEX>, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Widget.</ENAMEX>'' Symptomatic of their troubles was that after merging in April, labor bickering kept the Widget off the newsstands until September. The end came when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitney</ENAMEX> refused to keep subsidizing the paper's $700,000-a-month losses. Its death left the afternoon field to the ever-dying, everlasting Post, and the mornings to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tabloid Daily News</ENAMEX> as general newspapers.
The balance between morning and afternoon dailies would remain constant until the mid-1970s, but television and the newer suburban dailies were taking their toll. It was to be death in the afternoon. In 1975, there were 339 morning papers and 1,436 afternoons. By 1980, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ams</ENAMEX> were up to 387 and the Pms down to 1,388, and by 1988 morning readers could find 529 papers while the going-home crowd was down to 1,141.
