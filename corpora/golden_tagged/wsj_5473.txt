<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian Associates Inc.</ENAMEX> said net income in the fourth quarter ending Sept. 29 will be ``substantially below'' the 45 cents a share it reported in the third period.
The announcement, which contradicted a previous projection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian</ENAMEX> that earnings would rebound from depressed third-quarter levels, rocked its stock. In trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian</ENAMEX> closed at $25.75 a share, down $1.25.
The diversified electronics concern didn't specify what fourth-quarter net income would be. In the third quarter, earnings fell 23% to $9.1 million on sales of $333.5 million. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian</ENAMEX> earned $24.2 million, or $1.10 a share, including a gain of $9.6 million from the sale of a division and a charge of $22.8 million from restructuring.
A company spokesman said fourth-quarter results were dragged down by an ``embarrassing combination of unforeseen'' problems in its electron-device and systems businesses, which make microwave tubes for radars and other products. Among the problems were technical glitches with a tube product the company is trying to bring to market, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Varian</ENAMEX> also said fourth-quarter results will be hurt by reserves the company is establishing to cover anticipated legal expenses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian</ENAMEX> disclosed last month that some employees would be subpoenaed in connection with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s anti-trust probe of the power-grid tube industry, which supplies tubes for television and radio transmission.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian</ENAMEX> announced last month that it intends to restructure its electron-device and systems business. It said about 175 employees have been cut from that segment since June to cut costs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian</ENAMEX> said it also is considering further cost-cutting moves, and said it hasn't ruled out trying to sell the electron-device and systems business. That business typically accounts for about 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Varian</ENAMEX>'s sales, with the remainder split evenly between medical products, semiconductor-production equipment and analytical instruments.
