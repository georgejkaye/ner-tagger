A new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> program is grooming some Soviet lawyers to be matchmakers for U.S.-Soviet joint ventures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larisa Afanasyeva</ENAMEX>, one of the first 17 Soviet professionals to take part in this program, is a recognized legal scholar at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of State and Law.</ENAMEX> But, like most Soviet lawyers, she has little experience in bringing together clients from vastly different cultures and legal systems.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afanasyeva</ENAMEX> will try to learn how to do that during a six-month stint with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold & Porter</ENAMEX>, one of the first U.S. law firms to build up a Soviet practice. She concedes that her Marxist education hasn't prepared her for the complexities of the U.S. legal system. ``You have case law determined by courts and judges, and we have codes administered by government agencies,'' she says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irina Savelyeva</ENAMEX>, a law professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moscow State University</ENAMEX> who is interning at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> law firm of Heron, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burchette</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruckert & Rockwell</ENAMEX>, already has been put to work representing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.V. Dialogue</ENAMEX>, a joint venture set up by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> company and five Soviet state entities to produce Soviet software for domestic sale and possibly for export to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>. Currently she is looking into how her U.S. principals can repatriate profits from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. The Soviet ruble still can't be freely converted into Western currencies.
These Soviet interns were among several who were interviewed during their orientation course in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> recently.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Raikin</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> program, promises that it will be a ``two-way street,'' benefiting both the Soviet lawyers and their U.S. hosts. ``These young lawyers will learn how the Western system works,'' he says. ``At the same time they can give their American principals a better sense of Soviet law and psychology and help them locate potential Soviet business partners.''
There's no lack of potential business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. Since President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> called for massive structural reform, as many as 5,000 state agencies and enterprises have obtained the right to deal directly with foreign principals. ``They all want to do business with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,'' reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Podolsky</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> attorney who will intern for six months with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehrman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White & Mccauliffe</ENAMEX>.
A major obstacle to doing business, Soviet lawyers say, is that many people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> proposing joint ventures have failed to provide enough information to interest potential foreign investors. ``Two years ago nobody knew how to do this work,'' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sven Papp</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonian</ENAMEX> lawyer who will spend a total of six months at two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haight</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardner, Poor & Havens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White & Case</ENAMEX>.
But the interns are bullish about the future of their once-downtrodden profession. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> is a lawyer himself, so he is sincerely trying to turn our country into a law-based state,'' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Afanasyeva</ENAMEX>.
The Soviet legal community is divided into 80,000 ``jurisconsults,'' or legal advisers to state entities; 25,000 advocates, or independent lawyers; and several thousand judges, prosecutors, law professors and scholars. Some of the advocates are forming cooperatives -- the closest Soviet equivalent of Western law firms -- and are competing with the jurisconsults for the right to tap the growing joint-venture business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Konstantin Gavrilov</ENAMEX> is one of two jurisconsults in this first group of interns. He has more exposure to joint-venturing than the average advocate because his electronics firm in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Volga</ENAMEX> region produces microwave devices in cooperation with a West German firm. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gavrilov</ENAMEX> will intern with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boise Cascade Corp.</ENAMEX>, a company interested in international timber ventures.
The interns say they also are encouraged by the recent appointment of a recognized authority on civil law, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veniamin Yakovlevich</ENAMEX>, as minister of justice. The minister is encouraging another change in the profession -- the newly authorized right of lawyers to negotiate fees with clients.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soros Foundation</ENAMEX>, the program's financial backer, expects next year's class of interns to be nearly double the size of the first one. The foundation's patron, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Soros</ENAMEX>, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investor interested in improving economic ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>.
Another intern is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Valentin Blueger</ENAMEX>, an entertainment lawyer who represents rock star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laima Vaikule</ENAMEX>, the Soviet answer to Madonna. He has chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, the country-and-Western music capital, as his place of study and will share his time between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warfield & Kanaday</ENAMEX>, a law firm that does entertainment business, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanderbilt University Law School</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baiba Plaude</ENAMEX>, like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blueger</ENAMEX> a native of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Riga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latvia</ENAMEX>, will be interning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jenner & Block</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>.
The Latvians agree with their Russian colleagues' support of perestroika and the liberalized legal system -- only more so. ``We traditionally have been more Western and business-oriented,'' explains Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blueger</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raikin</ENAMEX> says the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> sponsors have been ``absolutely free'' to conduct this program without Soviet influence or interference, and the interns have been making their orientation rounds without any visible attention from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet Embassy</ENAMEX>.
