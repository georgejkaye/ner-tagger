Maggie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> must be doing something right; her political enemies are screaming louder than ever.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>, who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> encountered it, has made clear her opposition to refashioning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>. In return, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> is excoriated from Fleet Street to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> as an obstructionist.
Well, it now turns out that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had to travel across the globe to the 49-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth summit</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> to discomfit the Holy Order of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consensus Builders</ENAMEX>.
``A disastrous farce in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX>,'' screamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manchester</ENAMEX> Guardian. ``She can no longer be trusted to behave in a civilised -- that is unflaky -- fashion when abroad.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egad</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hawke</ENAMEX>, the paper said, were ``enraged.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Times</ENAMEX> said she had ``contravened protocol.''
As usual, her sin was saying what she thought. She issued a separate statement, separating herself from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth document</ENAMEX> reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>. While supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> ``in utterly condemning apartheid,'' her statement urged it to ``encourage change'' rather than inflict further punishment on the country's black population.
Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions: In May a Gallup <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poll</ENAMEX> found that most South African blacks, 85%, oppose economic sanctions. Still, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> had once again gone against the grain. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX>'s Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahathir Mohamad</ENAMEX> sniffed, ``If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot, you are out of step.'' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>: ``If it's one against 48, I'm very sorry for the 48.''
If indeed Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> has one opponent that could throw her off political course it is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s mysteriously intractable inflation problem. We can not, however, join the political chorus that as one proclaims how offputting it is that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> refuses to get along by going along. It is refreshing to see at least one world figure who knows what she believes in and is not inclined to reflexively compromise those beliefs.
Perhaps Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s voters will decide who is right about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, sanctioning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> or running <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s economy.
