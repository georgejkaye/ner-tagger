People start their own businesses for many reasons. But a chance to fill out sales-tax records is rarely one of them.
Red tape is the bugaboo of small business. Ironically, the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active, results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal, state and local regulators. Yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations -- and often is the only one available to tackle it.
There is hope of change. Last week, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Wallop</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyo.</ENAMEX>) held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses. ``A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and don't really apply to small businesses,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marian Jacob</ENAMEX>, a legislative aide to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallop</ENAMEX>. Other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently lapsed Paperwork Reduction Act, which many feel benefited small enterprises.
Thus, optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> gets around to arranging it. Meanwhile, they tackle the mounds of paper -- and fantasize about a dream world where bulk-mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished.
To find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most, the Journal asked a completely unscientific, random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail.
Some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose. They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good, and even to their own businesses.
Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior, generally the best regarded form of red tape, ``create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney West</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Techdesign International Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Springfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, business that designs telecommunication and other products. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">West</ENAMEX> cites the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> and its standards for telecommunications equipment: ``They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market.''
Some gripes about red tape are predictable: Architects complain about a host of building regulations, auto leasing companies about car insurance rules. Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Dooling</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dooling & Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, architectural firm. There is such a maze of federal, state and local codes that ``building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooling</ENAMEX> says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taxi</ENAMEX>, leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies. ``It's very costly and time-consuming,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Rosen</ENAMEX>, a partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fleet & Leasing Management Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> car-leasing company. One senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20% of his time on insurance, he says.
Other forms of red tape are more pervasive. The most onerous, many entrepreneurs say, is the record-keeping and filing required by tax authorities. Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second. But gripes run the gamut. Here is the red tape that irks surveyed business owners the most:
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS: Next to medical insurance, ``costs of compliance'' are the fastest-growing expense at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impco Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Providence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.I.</ENAMEX>, chemical company. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Gebhard</ENAMEX>, the company's owner, says spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it -- mostly to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws -- will rise almost 30% this year to $100,000. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gebhard</ENAMEX> adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5% and 7.5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impco</ENAMEX>'s total operating expenses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Reproduction Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Waltham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, maker of thin metal precision parts, must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire, police, hospital and plumbing authorities, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maguire</ENAMEX>, president. One state environmental regulator returned a report because ``it wasn't heavy enough, it couldn't have been correct,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maguire</ENAMEX> says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WITHHOLDING</ENAMEX> RULES: Employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding $3,000 within three days after payroll -- or pay stiff penalties -- and that's a big problem for small businesses. It's especially nettlesome ``if you're on the road and you're the one responsible,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Brown</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Capital Management Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> money-management firm. ip ip
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMPLOYEE MANUALS</ENAMEX>: Revising employee manuals on pensions, health care and other subjects costs over $25,000 a year for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Giguiere</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Professional Agricultural Management Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fresno</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, provider of business services to farmers. An employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals don't reflect the most recent laws, he says. But the ever-changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that ``you need professionals to help you; you can't do it yourself,'' he adds.
PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING RULES: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Complying</ENAMEX> with these is enough to make business owners look forward  to their own pension days. Yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Fixx</ENAMEX>, who runs her own public-relations concern in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, says she has had to overhaul her pension and profit-sharing plans three times in the past three years. ``It doesn't increase benefits, but it's costly and time-consuming,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fixx</ENAMEX> says. Compliance added 15 % to 20% to her accounting bill last year, she says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SALES TAX RECORDS</ENAMEX>: Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews. To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties, these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they didn't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense. ``You need one person to just take care of sales tax,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennie Tong</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
