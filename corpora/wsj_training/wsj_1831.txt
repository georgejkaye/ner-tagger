<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> can't chew gum and sing at the same time. But on the evidence of ``The Fabulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> Boys,'' that may be the only thing she can't do, at least when she's acting in movies.
As the tough, slinky lounge chanteuse in ``The Fabulous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> Boys,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> sings for herself, and more than passably well. Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie Diamond</ENAMEX> handles a song the way the greats do, like she's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she's concentrating on matching that internal tone. Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music. When she isn't performing for an audience, she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth, and indicates that she's finished by sticking the gum back in.
Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX>'s Susie seems like someone you've seen before, in numerous show-biz stories (even her name, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie Diamond</ENAMEX>, sounds like a character <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroe</ENAMEX> must have played). Yet nothing about ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> Boys,'' and certainly nothing about Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX>, really is like something from the video vault.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Kloves</ENAMEX>, the young writer and director (he isn't yet 30), has only one produced picture to his credit; he wrote the screenplay for ``Racing With the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moon</ENAMEX>,'' a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the'40s. Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older, someone who doesn't dismiss dreams, but who also has enough experience to see his limits. However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kloves</ENAMEX> directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace; ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> Boys'' is both bluesy and funny.
He's put a fresh spin on material that could come off terribly cliched; for example, the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susie</ENAMEX> wows an audience the first time she sings with the Baker Boys. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kloves</ENAMEX> has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they're doing.
Much of the picture's sensuality emerges from cinematographer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Ballhaus</ENAMEX>'s slyly seductive lens work. After working for years with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werner Rainer Fassbinder</ENAMEX>, the late German director, and more recently with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Scorsese</ENAMEX> (``After Hours,'' ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color of Money</ENAMEX>,'' ``The Last Temptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christ'')</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballhaus</ENAMEX> has developed a distinctively fluid style. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Grusin</ENAMEX>'s witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship (``Feelings'' is a must) without condescension.
Though Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> has the flashy part -- she gets the best comic bits and to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heelsthe  boys are pretty great, too. What seemed like a good idea, to cast the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridges</ENAMEX> brothers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beau</ENAMEX>) as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> brothers, actually turned out to be a good idea. Anyone who's tried to appear ``natural'' in front of a camera knows that it's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff. So it's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers isn't natural at all, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beau</ENAMEX> had to work like crazy to make their brotherly love -- and resentment and frustration and rage -- seem so very real.
When the movie opens the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> brothers are doing what they've done for 15 years professionally, and twice as long as that for themselves: They're playing proficient piano, face-to-face, on twin pianos. They're small time in the small time-hotels (not the best ones) and restaurants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>. Yet they don't disparage their audiences by disparaging their act. They wear tuxedos most nights, unless circumstances (a regular gig at a ``tropical'' lounge, for example) require them to wear special costumes, like Hawaiian shirts.
Plump Beau, looking eager to please with his arched eyebrows and round face, plays the older brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>. Frank plans the program, takes care of business, and approaches the work like any other job. He's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job. He's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs; the audience sees only the house, and only near the end of the movie. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> grovels a little for the bookers, probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation. On his off-hours he wears cardigan sweaters.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bridges</ENAMEX> is the younger brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>, who fancies himself the rebellious artist; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs, who climbs down the fire escape. Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>'s the one who can remember every dive they ever played, and when, and he dutifully shows up for work night after night (he consoles himself with booze and by showing up at the last minute). Looking leaner than he has in a while, the younger Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridges</ENAMEX>'s Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>, who's managed to chisel his dreams to fit reality without feeling too cheated. He can live with little pleasures.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kloves</ENAMEX> has put together some priceless moments. These include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Tilly</ENAMEX>'s audition to be the Baker Boys' girl singer. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tilly</ENAMEX> of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster's girlfriend on the television show, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Street Blues</ENAMEX>.'' Here she delivers, especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the ``Candy Man,'' which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that couldn't be more perfect. (It matches her voice.) And Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX>'s particular version of ``Making Whoopee'' -- and the way Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballhaus</ENAMEX> photographs her, from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Monroe</ENAMEX> if Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> hadn't gone and become a star in her own right.
VIDEO TIP: If you'd like to see the first time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> sang on screen, and you have a lot of patience, take a look at ``Grease 2.'' You'll find her there. Better yet, check out the emergence of her comic persona in ``Married to the Mob,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Demme</ENAMEX>'s delightful <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mafia</ENAMEX> comedy.
