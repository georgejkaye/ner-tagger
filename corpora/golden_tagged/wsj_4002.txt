<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> said it has appointed statutory managers for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFC New Zealand Ltd.</ENAMEX> because the investment bank said it was experiencing serious financial difficulties.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFC</ENAMEX> is 20%-owned by U.S. investment banker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Bros.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inc.</ENAMEX> and 80%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Provident Fund</ENAMEX>.
Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFC</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached to comment.
Don <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brash</ENAMEX>, governor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, declined at a news conference Tuesday to answer questions about the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFC</ENAMEX>'s loan provisions because, he said, the figures haven't been audited and they are confidential under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Bank</ENAMEX>'s regulations.
But he added: ``Clearly, if the figure is substantiated it leaves them {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFC</ENAMEX>} with inadequate shareholders' funds to continue trading.''
Asked what impact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFC</ENAMEX>'s situation would have on other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> banks, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brash</ENAMEX> replied: ``To the best of our knowledge there are no other institutions placed at risk by this action.''
Later, he added: ``Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFC</ENAMEX>'s creditors are, in fact, international banks rather than domestic banks so that we wouldn't expect the immediate domestic fallout to be very substantial.
