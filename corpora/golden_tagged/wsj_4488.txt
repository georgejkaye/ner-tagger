<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> and the International Monetary Fund agreed on an economic program that will provide the country $1.4 billion in loans.
The IMF lending is linked to the country's achieving mutually agreed-on targets for such economic indicators as its budget deficit and rate of inflation.
The accord, which is to run until the end of 1990, is to be formally ratified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s board in coming weeks. The money would boost reserves and help stabilize the economy.
Argentine President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Saul Menem</ENAMEX> told reporters early yesterday that the agreement had been reached. This was confirmed several hours later by a person close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>. Details of the agreement weren't disclosed.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menem</ENAMEX>, who was elected president this year, met yesterday with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. In a statement after the meeting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> ``noted President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menem</ENAMEX>'s determination in dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Argentina</ENAMEX>'s economic crisis and stated U.S. support for his program.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>'s central bank president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Javier Gonzalez Fraga</ENAMEX>, who helped negotiate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> accord, had earlier outlined Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menem</ENAMEX>'s economic program to restore stability to the economy. The program primarily consists of an orthodox anti-inflation strategy based on fiscal and monetary equilibrium backed by price and wage agreements; tax revision; greater independence for the country's central bank; and deregulation and privatization of state concerns.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> has arrears to foreign commercial bank creditors exceeding $4 billion and has had difficulty complying with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> programs.
