<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broad Inc.</ENAMEX> said it doubled its regular quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 2.5 cents on common, and to 4.5 cents a share 2.25 cents on Class B stock, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record Nov. 6.
The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufman & Broad, Inc.</ENAMEX>, which spun off its home-building subsidiary into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufman & Broad Home Corp.</ENAMEX> earlier this year and changed its name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broad Inc.</ENAMEX>
For the 10-month fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eli Broad</ENAMEX> said he expected earnings results to approximate analysts' estimates, which the company said have been revised upward to 80 cents a share. This would compare with an estimated loss of 3 cents a share for the comparable 10 months last year, which included restructuring costs.
