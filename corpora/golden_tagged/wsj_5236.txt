<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clorox Co.</ENAMEX>'s two paint subsidiaries for $130 million, doubling its consumer paint business.
The units are Olympic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homecare Products</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucite Homecare Products</ENAMEX>, which have combined annual paint and stain sales of about $100 million.
The transaction is subject to government approval and other conditions.
The planned purchase gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG</ENAMEX>, a maker of glass, chemicals and coatings, broader distribution for its consumer paints, which analysts say have lagged its industrial and automotive coatings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> Paints brand is distributed through independent dealers, while the Olympic and Lucite products will open up the home-center market for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG</ENAMEX>. That's important because of stiff retail competition among paint makers, according to analysts.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clorox</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, household-products concern, the sale price is a discount, considering the two brands were purchased for about $173 million in separate transactions in 1981 and 1983. However, the acquisitions did include other units, such as a plastic molding business, which have been sold previously.
But analysts consider Clorox's performance in the paint business mediocre. ``The two businesses were almost destined to fail,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Wilbur</ENAMEX>, analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co.</ENAMEX> One reason, he suggests, was Clorox's marketing approach that put too much emphasis on advertising brand names.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur</ENAMEX> says that consumers tend to buy whatever paint is offered in a local store rather than shop until they find a certain brand. ``You can't use mass advertising to drag people in,'' he adds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clorox</ENAMEX> officials say they decided to get out of the paint business so they could focus on the company's household and grocery-products operations.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clorox</ENAMEX> closed at $41.625, up $1, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG</ENAMEX> slipped 37.5 cents to $44.375.
