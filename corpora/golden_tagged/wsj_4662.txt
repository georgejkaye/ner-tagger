The fierce fight over cutting capital-gains taxes is supposed to be a clear contest between conservatives, who want to slash taxes, and liberals, who oppose measures helping the rich.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oregon</ENAMEX>'s Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Wyden</ENAMEX> is a liberal Democrat; he votes the liberal position more than 80% of the time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conversely</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>'s Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Stenholm</ENAMEX> is a conservative cotton farmer and the very emblem of the Democrats' Boll Weevil wing; his liberal voting record is less than 20%.
Yet Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX>, on this issue, is voting with the Republicans and some conservative Democrats to cut capital-gains taxes. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX> is sticking with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> leadership and not only voting against the cut, but working against it.
This demonstrates former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas O'Neill</ENAMEX>'s  dictum that ``all politics is local,'' even on a visible vote like this one. Oregon timber interests are a powerful factor behind Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX>'s active role in trying to turn fellow Democrats toward President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. In contrast, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX> puts a farmer's priority on lowering interest rates, and so is drawn to a Democratic alternative that promises to do more to reduce the budget deficit and also encourages savings by expanding the largely middle-class tax break for individual retirement accounts.
``I'm hearing from the people who are basic to the economic future of my state,'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX> says. Answers Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX>: ``A majority of people in my district would like to see us do more about the deficit than decide who's going to get a tax cut.''
The capital-gains vote, which is expected tomorrow, is likely to be close and decided by swing Democrats. All but a handful of the 176 House Republicans will stay with the administration, which must build on its alliances with Southerners in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> and capture 45 to 50 Democrats to ensure a majority for the president. After beginning late, the Democratic leadership is on the defensive and still faces unrest on the left. But the party's greater test is on the right, where it can't afford to lose more than half of the more than 80 Democrats in the Deep South and border states including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.
In the first major economic showdown between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> on any major issue, Reps. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wyden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stenholm</ENAMEX> illustrate the competing strategies. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX> reflects the administration's effort to exploit local interests to reach beyond the Republican's traditional conservative economic base in the Democratic-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX> is just as crucial for the new Democratic leadership, which must split the old Boll Weevil wing -- so helpful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> -- if it has any hope of denying Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> his victory.
The fight is important to the new speaker, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, who has links to both Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX> and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX>. The speaker is a native of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX> and is familiar with many of the same economic interests driving Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX>. And as a former chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Agriculture Committee</ENAMEX>, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> can call on ties to farm-state Democrats such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX>, and also other swing delegations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern border</ENAMEX> states and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>.
But the speaker will have his hands full trying to defeat the tax-cut plan, which, with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s ardent support, was narrowly approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> two weeks ago. The measure would reduce the top tax rate on capital gains for 2 1/2 years to 19.6% from the current 33%. After that, the rate would be set at 28%, and the gains would be indexed for inflation. Proponents say the measure would raise revenue in the short run and boost economic growth in the long term.
Democratic leaders assert that the capital-gains tax reduction would almost exclusively benefit the wealthy without much proven benefit to the economy as a whole. In its stead, they are seeking to substitute a package that would increase the top tax rate on the richest Americans to 33% from the current 28% and also to expand the deduction for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iras</ENAMEX>, which would help both middle-income and upper-income people. Over five years, the package would raise an estimated $25 billion that, the leaders say, would be set aside to reduce the federal budget deficit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicans</ENAMEX> are seeking to label the alternative as just another tax increase from the ``tax-and-spend Democrats.'' The Democratic leadership describes the Bush plan as a raid on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> by the ``super rich.''
For Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX>, the issue is far more mundane and parochial, since timber sales by individuals are given capital-gains tax treatment. He notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> has 20,000 privately owned woodlots covering four million acres. He also says that his state has one of the nation's largest per-capita concentrations of small businesses. A cut in the capital-gains tax would be a boon to these people, whom he asserts are more middle class than wealthy.
``The theory that a capital-gains differential will just help rich people is an absolute myth,'' he says. After addressing an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL-CIO</ENAMEX> convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore.</ENAMEX>, recently, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX> says union members who had Christmas-tree businesses on the side urged him to vote for the cut.
As a co-chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>'s 121-member forestry caucus, he has taken an active roll in doing just that. Just last week, he met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> on the capital-gains issue, and although he prefers a permanent cut, he is now helping to round up Democratic votes for the pending capital-gains bill. Over the weekend, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gephardt</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>) tried to change Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX>'s mind, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> lawmaker refused to budge. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> leadership was in turmoil earlier this year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX> explained, he and other Democrats had gotten themselves ``in concrete'' on the issue.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wyden</ENAMEX>'s position isn't without risk. He has ambitions for election to statewide office, and one potential rival, Democratic Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Aucoin</ENAMEX>, has aligned himself with the party leadership, saying the GOP plan poses a threat to the timber industry. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aucoin</ENAMEX> has supported capital-gains tax cuts in the past, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> plan, he says, invites a short-term liquidation of timber assets that jeopardizes the industry's long-term supply.
The Democratic leadership's strategy focuses on keeping its own defections to fewer than 40. This means holding its liberals, some of whom are grousing about the alternative package's IRA expansion. More importantly, it means winning the votes of at least half of the Democrats in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and in more than a dozen Southern and border states. Indeed, the fight has taken on a clear regional cast, with influential Texans such as Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Leath</ENAMEX> arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southerners</ENAMEX> must stand together with their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> allies in favor of the tax cut if their conservative voice is ever to be heard.
Indeed, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX>'s decision to fight the capital-gains cut is causing him trouble with his Boll Weevil colleagues, for whom passing the measure is a long-cherished goal. ``My arm is being twisted in the armpit pretty good,'' he says.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX> is holding firm with the Democratic leadership because he says he sees the capital-gains plan as a budget gimmick that over time will lose money after a short-term revenue gain. He also says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> plan would be more useful to his constituents and the economy as a whole, which needs more savings. ``Those who vote against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> will have a lot of explaining to do,'' he says.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> Democrat was consulted in the drafting of the Democratic plan, and though he denies ambitions to move up in the leadership, he has been a prominent ally of the leaders in recent debates. He is close to Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gray</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, the third-ranking Democrat, and Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> attended a recent fund-raising reception for him in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stenholm</ENAMEX> announced his stand this week alongside moderate Democrats from Midwestern farm districts, but his message is aimed foremost at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southerners</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> are two delegations where the leadership hopes this tack will succeed. ``It's not the time to make the deficit worse,'' says Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Olin</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> Democrat and retired electronics executive. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leath</ENAMEX> scoffs: ``Anybody who thinks liberal Democrats are going to put that money toward deficit reduction is smoking rope.
