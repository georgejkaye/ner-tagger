<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crop Genetics International Corp.</ENAMEX> expects to begin field tests next year of a new bioherbicide technology designed to reduce farmers' use of chemical herbicides as much as 90%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John B. Henry</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer, said that greenhouse testing this year at the company's research center in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> produced such encouraging results that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crop Genetics</ENAMEX> applied last week for a U.S. patent on the technology.
Registered under the trademark X-tend, the technology combines a small amount of chemical herbicide with highly concentrated bacteria that attack and kill weeds. The diluted chemical puts stress on weeds without killing them, greatly increasing their susceptibility to the bacteria. The bacteria kill the weeds, then enter the soil and have no further effect. ``It's like a one-two punch. The chemical weakens the plant and the bacteria finish the job,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Carlson</ENAMEX>, the company's chief scientist. ``We think this biological solution has broad application.''
The technology promises to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crop Genetics</ENAMEX> an entry into the herbicide market. Farmers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> spend an estimated $6 billion a year on chemical herbicides.
The bacteria-based technology also complements the company's biopesticide product lines, including its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Incide</ENAMEX> plant-vaccine technology. Expanded field trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incide</ENAMEX> are already under way. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nebraska</ENAMEX>, for example, corn crops are being evaluated for effectiveness of the company's seed inoculation technique as a defense against corn borers, which cause an estimated $500 million in crop damage annually despite expenditure of about $50 million on chemcial insecticides.
Moreover, the company hopes its new bioherbicide will cut costs of chemical herbicides to farmers and curb the chemical contamination of soil and water. ``We don't have to create a new herbicide,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX>.
The greenhouse tests were conducted on such species as velvet leaf, foxtail and barnyard grass, three of the most economically burdensome weeds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Such weeds not only plague row crops, including corn, wheat, barley, soy beans and cotton, they also require extensive control efforts on highways and railroad beds and at industrial sites.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Dodson</ENAMEX>, marketing vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crop Genetics</ENAMEX>, said the bacteria, combined with greatly diluted solutions of such commercial herbicides as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banvel</ENAMEX>, produced by a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandoz AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roundup</ENAMEX>, produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX>, provided a high degree of weed control. Bacteria combined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banvel</ENAMEX> diluted by 75%, for example, was sprayed on the weeds and killed 93% of the velvet leaf, 91% of the foxtail and 100% of the barnyard grass, he said.
``Banvel doesn't even have grasses on its label,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dodson</ENAMEX> said. ``We literally have made a new market for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banvel.</ENAMEX>''
He indicated the company will need to conduct field tests for at least three years before it is ready to begin broad commercial marketing of the product line. That field testing will begin in 1990 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> with a corporate partner he didn't identify. Further tests may be conducted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> for grain crops and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> for cotton.
For the year ended March 31, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crop Genetics</ENAMEX> reported a net loss of $6.3 million on revenue of $2.9 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX> and development costs totaled $4.8 million, up from $2.8 million the prior year.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry</ENAMEX> said the company has invested about $20 million, or about half of the total research capital it has raised, on development of plant-vaccine technology and related work on pesticides and insecticides. ``Now we are ready to begin systematic investment in the herbicide business,'' he said.
