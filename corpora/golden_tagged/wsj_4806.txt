President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> offered to cut <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> stockpiles of chemical weapons 80% if the Soviets reduce their larger stocks to an equal level and if the two nations can agree on means to verify compliance with such an accord.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s initiative, delivered in his first address as president to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, was intended to give momentum to long-running efforts by 40 nations to sign a treaty to ban production of chemical weapons over a 10-year period. The effort also was meant in part to answer Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s critics, both domestic and foreign, who say he has been too timid in responding to changing international developments -- particularly to diplomatic initiatives by the Soviets.
Although administration officials touted the initiative as a bold move, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law already requires a substantial cut in chemical-weapons stocks by 1997. As part of a compromise that allowed the Reagan administration to begin producing safer, so-called binary chemical weapons, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> insisted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> destroy all of its older chemical-weapon stocks by that year. Binary weapons consist of two separate chemical agents that are harmless until they mix after the shell is fired.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX>, estimated that the weapons already earmarked for destruction roughly would amount to the 80% cuts Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> promised. ``He is making a virtue out of necessity,'' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nunn</ENAMEX>.
But Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> said in a news conference that the president's proposal could lead to a much quicker reduction in chemical-weapons stockpiles than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law requires. He also noted that the plan would prevent a build-up in supplies of the newer weapons, which he said could grow under the law to levels ``vastly greater'' than current stockpiles of the older ones.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX> Adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX> said Soviet leaders had been apprised of the U.S. proposal in advance. Soviet Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> later said the Soviets have a ``positive view of the proposal.'' At a meeting last weekend in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> signed an agreement under which the two nations will exchange information about their stockpiles of chemical weapons and facilities for producing them.
The president's proposed cut in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and Soviet chemical-weapon stocks would come even before a multilateral treaty to end production of chemical weapons is signed. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also offered to eliminate all but 2% of such weapons within eight years of the signing of such a treaty. And he said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would eliminate the remaining stocks in the next two years, but only if all nations capable of producing them -- including such intransigent countries as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX> -- agree to a ban.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said 20 nations currently are capable of producing the weapons. The initiative doesn't include biological weapons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> said.
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> refuses to disclose the exact level of its chemical-weapon stocks, many experts believe the U.S. inventory totals 30,000 tons. The Soviets claim to have 50,000 tons of chemical weapons, but U.S. experts believe the number could be as high as 300,000 tons.
U.S. officials admitted that the difficulty of precisely verifying current quantities of chemical weapons, or even which nations possess them, has been a major obstacle in reaching the multilateral agreement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> called the search for acceptable verification procedures a ``daunting challenge.''
The chemical weapons proposal was the only new initiative in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> speech, which challenged the organization to confront the ``global challenges of the 21st century'' -- including economic growth and environmental problems, drug trafficking and terrorism. He specifically called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. General Assembly</ENAMEX> to condemn the killing of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Higgins</ENAMEX>, who was kidnapped and killed by a Shiite terrorist group while serving on a peace-keeping force in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also lauded what he called the ascendancy of freedom and market economies around the world, a theme he also sounded during his trip last summer to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>.
Nevertheless, reflecting warming relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, the president made only positive references to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>. Referring to last weekend's meeting between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said, ``I am very pleased by the progress we made.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> said the new chemical-weapon initiative was meant in part to take advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s cooperative attitude on arms-control issues. He noted, for example, that the Soviets have already offered to make far larger cuts than the U.S. in conventional weapons.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> representative to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> in the 1970s, his reception by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Assembly</ENAMEX> was tepid. The 40-minute speech was interrupted only twice by applause. But he and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, as well as Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, were greeted warmly by the delegates before the speech.
