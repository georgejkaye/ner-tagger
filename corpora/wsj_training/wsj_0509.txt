For the sixth time in as many years, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX> has a new senior executive. Gone is D. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Corr</ENAMEX>, the airline's chairman, chief executive and president, appointed only last December.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX> resigned to pursue other business interests, the airline said. He could not be reached for comment.
Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lorenzo</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental's</ENAMEX> parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX>, 49 years old, is reclaiming the job that was his before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX> signed on.
The airline also named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Foret</ENAMEX> as president. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foret</ENAMEX>, 44, is a 15-year veteran of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas International Airlines</ENAMEX>, its predecessor. Most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX>.
Top executives at Continental haven't lasted long, especially those recruited from outside. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX>'s tenure was shorter than most. The 48-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX> was hired largely because he was credited with returning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX> to profitability while he was its president from 1986 to 1988. Before that, he was an executive with a manufacturing concern.
At Continental he cut money-losing operations, which helped produce a modest profit in this year's second quarter. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX>, a stunt pilot in his spare time, was understood to be frustrated by what he regarded as limited freedom under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX>.
While not officially an executive at Continental during Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX>'s tenure, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> is known for keeping close tabs on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX>'s operating units. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX>'s flagship and was built painfully to its present size under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in 1986.
It's unclear what role, if any, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX>'s recent exploration of a possible sale of a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX> had in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX>'s departure. One source familiar with the airline said, however, that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX> wasn't informed in advance during the summer when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> began discussions with potential buyers.
During his tenure, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corr</ENAMEX> attempted through a series of meetings to inform managers of some of the company's future plans, traveled widely to talk to employees and backed training sessions designed to improve the carrier's image.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foret</ENAMEX> is one of a handful of executives Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorenzo</ENAMEX> has relied on over the years. Previously, he had served in financial planning positions at the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> unit. Another longtime ally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Bakes</ENAMEX>, currently heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX>, now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bakes</ENAMEX> previously had a turn at running Continental.
Among the other alumni are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf</ENAMEX>, now chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Inc.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Plaskett</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am Corp.</ENAMEX>
