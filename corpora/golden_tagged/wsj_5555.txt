<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX>'s three vehicle-marketing divisions are estimating 1990 sales at more than two million cars and trucks, about the same as expectations for 1989, despite forecasts that industry sales overall will drop next year.
At the No. 3 auto maker's new-model preview here, marketing executives predicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> division will sell one million vehicles in the 1990 calendar year, about the same as forecasts for 1989. Deliveries would be split roughly evenly between cars and trucks.
Sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plymouth</ENAMEX> products should total about 750,000, up from an estimated 700,000 this year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX>-Eagle sales should rise slightly to more than 300,000 units. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX> trucks and sport-utility vehicles should represent 250,000 to 260,000 of the total, with Eagle cars accounting for the remainder.
