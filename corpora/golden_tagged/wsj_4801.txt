<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek Inc.</ENAMEX> named a new president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Spoon</ENAMEX>, who is part of a new generation of executives at the newsweekly's parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post Co.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spoon</ENAMEX>, 38 years old, will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek magazine</ENAMEX>, whose circulation recently reached a record high, but which is engaged in an ever-more costly battle for advertising dollars with its rival, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time magazine</ENAMEX>.
The post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> has been vacant since January, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher M. Little</ENAMEX> abruptly resigned to become president of the much-smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowles Magazine Inc.</ENAMEX>, a publisher of special interest magazines.
Since last spring, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spoon</ENAMEX> has served at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> in an unofficial troika, which included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard W. Smith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s publisher, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard Smith</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s vice chairman.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spoon</ENAMEX> was a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Consulting Co.</ENAMEX> when he joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> in 1982. Currently a vice president at the parent company, he has been head of its new business development and of marketing and finance for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> newspaper.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard D. Simmons</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spoon</ENAMEX> was chosen ``because he's the best conceivable person to continue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s growth.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s earnings this year will be the highest ever.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> has not been a major contributor to the earnings of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>, whose other properties include television stations, cable operations and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Kaplan</ENAMEX> Educational Centers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> recorded about $20 million in operating profit last year, or only about 8% of the parent's net income, compared with $140 million in operating profit recorded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> newspaper.
While Newsweek circulation has been holding steady at about 3.2 million, the newsweekly's advertising performance in the last two years has been hurt by flat spending patterns by national advertisers in consumer magazines. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> has also found itself at a disadvantage against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s advertiser incentive program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Max Plan</ENAMEX>, which offers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s stable of magazines in combination packages to advertisers.
In 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s ad pages totaled 2,479, a drop of 3.3% from 1987, while ad revenue increased slightly to $242 million. For the first six months of 1989, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>'s ad pages totaled 1,176, a drop of 0.5% from the same period in 1988, while ad revenue in the first half was $119 million, an increase of 6.9% from last year.
``Our pages are down from last year, but our revenue is up nicely,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spoon</ENAMEX>. ``The bottom line will look very good this year.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spoon</ENAMEX> said he expected no great changes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>, except that he would continue efforts to extend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX>'s name to new media properties.
In early 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> folded two specialty editions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> on Campus and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek on Health</ENAMEX>, largely for lack of national advertising. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> launched in January a specialty edition called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek Business</ENAMEX>, which replaced two previous editions. With a circulation of 750,000, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek Business</ENAMEX> carries ads targeted specifically at an audience that regularly reads business magazines such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s Fortune.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spoon</ENAMEX> labeled as ridiculous recurring industry rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katharine Graham</ENAMEX> would consider selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX>. ``The Grahams have told me,'Do'Do your best. We are behind you,''' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spoon</ENAMEX>.
