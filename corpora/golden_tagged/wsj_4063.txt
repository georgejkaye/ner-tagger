A group led by former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E. Simon</ENAMEX> said it plans to raise about $100 million in public financing to bring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honfed Bank</ENAMEX> into compliance with minimum capital requirements set by the recent federal thrift bailout legislation.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> declined to elaborate on the fund-raising plans except to say that the funds would be used to replace about $80 million in goodwill carried on the books of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX>-based thrift. Goodwill is an accounting device allowing a thrift to use intangible or non-earning assets to shore up its asset base.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> and his group acquired Honfed in late 1986 after it slipped into insolvency. After taking write-downs on bad loans and certain real estate assets, the group was allowed to create about $100 million in goodwill in order to meet regulatory capital requirements at the time. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, in its recent thrift bailout legislation, has ordered thrifts to phase out the use of goodwill in meeting new capital requirements.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honfed</ENAMEX> has since paid down its goodwill assets to $80 million, using cash from earnings. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> said that while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honfed</ENAMEX> technically has five years to replace the remainder of its goodwill, the group decided to move more quickly, because ``we wanted Honfed to be a sound institution beyond any question.'' The thrift, as of June 30, had assets of $3.05 billion.
