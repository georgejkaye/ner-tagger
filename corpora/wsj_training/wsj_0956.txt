In a corner of the cavernous, new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Convention Center</ENAMEX> sits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda Motor Corp.</ENAMEX>'s advanced-technology display. The highlight: a ``fragrance control system.''
With the touch of a button, drivers can choose from lavender, jasmine, mint or perfume scents, all blown in through the car's air-conditioning system. The soft, wafting aromas will ``improve ride comfort,'' the display attests, and a proud employee says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two.
Welcome to the 28th <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Motor Show. Here you can find <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> displaying a ``live fish transporter,'' a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> with its ``keyless'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boga</ENAMEX>, whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner's fingerprints. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s Escudome sport vehicle features a pop-out rear tent and invites drivers to go ``back to the nature.''
But this biennial event, the world's largest display of cars and trucks, has its serious side, including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle-suspension systems. It's also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged, and therein lies the draw.
Even the biggest auto shows in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> are largely regional affairs, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> show is international. Virtually every automotive analyst in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> showed up. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> flights were booked solid this week as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor City</ENAMEX> executives, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald E. Petersen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Greenwald</ENAMEX>, flocked to see the future. Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> came, for the first time in 24 years, to show off its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lada Niva</ENAMEX> sedan and its futuristic dark-blue ``Kompakt'' model.
Here's a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported, and what the foreign visitors saw.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Technology</ENAMEX>
The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps, potholes and other rigors of the road. These ``active suspension systems'' electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car's ride. Existing suspension systems try to absorb bounces, but active suspension provides power to counter the jolts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX>, in a 34-page tract, modestly compares its ``hydraulic active suspension'' to a cheetah, and equates the various parts to the animal's heart, brain, nerves and blood vessels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension's inner workings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> says it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>'s Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring. But drivers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> must wait: The Japanese, for now, are keeping active suspension for domestic use only. And <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>'s Big Three auto makers say their systems are still under development.
In the engine department, several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today's engines and yet take up only half the space, allowing for shorter hoods. In the so-called two-stroke engines, which are expected to get sharply higher gas mileage, each piston goes up and down only once to provide power. By contrast, the pistons in conventional four-stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle.
The two-stroke engine displays by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fuji Heavy Industries</ENAMEX>, the maker of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subaru</ENAMEX> cars, drew plenty of interest from U.S. auto executives, who are rushing to develop two-stroke engines.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> shows a more conventional five-cylinder engine in the new Accord Inspire model, which made its debut just this month -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> only. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> says the five-cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel-economy of a four-cylinder, and the power of a V-6. It is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury Acura line in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> officials wouldn't comment.
Odd Cars, Funny Names
There's plenty of whimsy here, but it isn't always clear whether it's intentional. The show's symbol is a woman riding on a snail, not your usual metaphor for speed and agility. But the sponsors have an explanation: ``Through the character associated with a snail,'' they say, ``important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought.''
Japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names, but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high -- or low. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> has a tiny motorcycle called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monkey</ENAMEX>, and a slightly larger cousin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gorilla</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> has a futuristic delivery truck called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guppy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> has the Bongo truck and, under its Autozam nameplate, a ``microvan'' called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scrum</ENAMEX>. Its buglike Carol minicar is ``designed with softness, gentleness and warmheartedness.''
But the court jester appears to be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s smallest car maker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daihatsu Motor Co.</ENAMEX> One of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sneaker</ENAMEX>, which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daihatsu</ENAMEX> also has the Fellow 90, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leeza Spider</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hijet Dumbo</ENAMEX>.
The jokes aren't just on the Japanese, though. Regie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationale des Usines Renault</ENAMEX>, the French auto maker, has a concept car called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Megane</ENAMEX>. The name is supposed to connote feminine grandeur, but in Japanese it means ``eyeglasses.''
Foreign Presence
Foreign auto makers are taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Motor Show more seriously than ever. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB Volvo</ENAMEX> invites passers-by to play ``the role of the test dummy'' by hopping in a car that simulates a crash to show just how its seat-belt tightener works. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyundai Motor Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> has its first-ever exhibit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years, and it includes a boxy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> station wagon with wood-grain side panels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> also have exhibits, although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less-popular automotive parts section.
``We've got to get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> mentality and be part of the world mentality,'' declares <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles M. Jordan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s vice president for design, in explaining his pilgrimage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Show.
Even so, traditional American cockiness isn't terribly endangered. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials, for example, crowed about their first-ever <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prix</ENAMEX> racing victory. True, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> was declared the winner Sunday, but only after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> driver who crossed the finish line first was disqualified because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, still criticizes Japanese styling. ``It's hard for the Japanese,'' he says, ``to get a feeling in a car, to get a passion in a car, to get emotion in a car.
