<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> said it is testing a service that provides multilocation customers with a summary of important management information collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s billing process.
The service, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Portfolio</ENAMEX>, was announced at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telecommunications Association</ENAMEX> conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>. The service is being used at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s largest customers, and will be tested at about 20 companies before the end of the year. A full roll-out is planned for the first quarter of next year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based long-distance telephone company said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Sharer</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> executive vice president, said the new service eliminates the labor-intensive task of culling management information from pages and pages of telephone bills and immediately gives a telecom manager a picture of how the communications dollar is being spent.
The market for the service, which is expected to become an important tool for selling MCI service to large customers, is the 15,000 to 20,000 companies that have five or more locations. Together, those companies spend an estimated $12 billion annually on telecommunications services, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said.
