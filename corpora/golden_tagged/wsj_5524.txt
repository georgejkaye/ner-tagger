<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorimar Television</ENAMEX>'s new TV game show, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> Card,'' has another ace up its sleeve besides the involvement of developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>. In an unusual twist, the new show will allow viewers to play at home and win money and prizes.
The show, whose announcement was delayed two weeks by last-minute approvals and contractual details, was unveiled yesterday. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> said the game show will be taped at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trump Castle Hotel and Casino</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, where guests will have a chance to appear in the studio audience. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> said he may appear on the show occasionally, if asked, and will help promote it in other ways.
The developer said he has ``a good, substantial stake'' in the show but that his share of profits will go entirely to charity. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX>'s profit will be a return on his investment in the program, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorimar</ENAMEX> wouldn't disclose. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorimar</ENAMEX> will be a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> when the company completes its acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorimar</ENAMEX>'s parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorimar</ENAMEX> has a good track record in syndication and has 11 prime-time network series, it is impossible to predict the Trump show's chance of success. It will be going head-to-head with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King World Productions Inc.</ENAMEX>'s ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune,'' which easily beat most competing shows in the ``prime access'' slot just before prime time.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David E. Salzman</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorimar</ENAMEX>, described the game as ``bingo-like'' and said it is modeled after a hit British game show, whose creators pitched it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorimar</ENAMEX>. He said the game features three players answering ``challenging questions'' and aiming to fill in a numbered, three-row game card. A bonus round involves filling in a five-row card either across or diagonally. Neither the prizes nor the hosts have been determined. The show's debut is set for fall 1990, assuming enough TV stations sign up.
The home-audience participation aspect will start only in test markets the first year, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salzman</ENAMEX>, but once the concept has been perfected, more than 50 million game cards will be distributed nationally for play each weekday. (The British version doesn't involve home-audience participation.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viewers</ENAMEX> won't have the chance to have their answers to game questions judged but will win if numbers on their cards correspond to those on the show.
