<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Abba Goldberg</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matthews & Wright Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $100,000 for his role in a scheme to defraud a trust fund as part of a $300 million <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guam</ENAMEX> bond issue underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matthews & Wright</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX>, who in July pleaded guilty in federal court here to three counts of using the mails to defraud the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guam</ENAMEX> trust fund of $57,500, also was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to make restitution of $300,000 to the South Pacific U.S. territory. However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> would be eligible for parole after six months in prison, and the amount of restitution could be reduced under the sentence handed down yesterday by Senior U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Curtis</ENAMEX>.
Known as an aggressive Wall Street dealmaker, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> was indicted by a U.S. grand jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guam</ENAMEX> in late 1987 on 52 counts of bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice in what authorities had charged was a nationwide bogus bond scheme totaling $2 billion.
The 46-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> deputy attorney general, has been on leave from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matthews & Wright</ENAMEX> since the indictment. Still pending are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>'s charges against him and others of fraud in connection with ``sham closings'' of more than $1 billion of municipal bonds in violation of tax rules in 1985 and 1986. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matthews & Wright</ENAMEX> and two individuals settled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> was fighting the charges.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. William O'Connor</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guam</ENAMEX>, had sought a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and a $750,000 fine. But he said yesterday that the court had gone ``into the matter with great care and the public interest has been served'' by the sentence. An attorney for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX> declined to comment.
