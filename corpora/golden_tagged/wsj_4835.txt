Six bidders, including the rail units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilford Transportation Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>, offered to take the financially troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware & Hudson Railway</ENAMEX> out of bankruptcy.
Also bidding were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Otsego Corp.</ENAMEX>, newly formed Rail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Inc.</ENAMEX>, an investor group associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim Schroder & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D&H Railway Acquisition Corp.</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Serlin</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenixville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, investor. In addition, several other bidders expressed interest in buying some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware & Hudson</ENAMEX>'s assets rather than the entire railroad.
The multiplicity of bids sent a strong signal that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware & Hudson</ENAMEX> won't be liquidated. The carrier filed under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in June 1988, protecting itself from creditor lawsuits while it worked out a plan to pay its debts.
The ailing line's trustee last summer set a Sept. 1 deadline for bids before extending it to yesterday.
``Fifteen months ago people said we would be lucky to find a single bidder because of the railroad's long history of losses and problems,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Dicello</ENAMEX>, trustee of the ailing carrier. ``Now, it looks like we have the basis for a reorganization to keep this railroad running.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dicello</ENAMEX> declined to comment on rail industry speculation that the bids ranged from $25 million to $60 million in cash and debt assumption.
The outcome is important to shippers and government officials concerned about preserving rail freight competition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>. The 1,200-mile line in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> provides some of the last remaining rail freight competition to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consolidated Rail Corp.</ENAMEX>
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dicello</ENAMEX> said he will report to the Bankruptcy court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilmington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del.</ENAMEX>, next Monday on how long it may take to reach a final agreement with one or more of the bidders, a speedy resolution isn't likely. Prospective bidders face possibly lengthy negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Watervliet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, carrier's labor unions to reduce the size of crews and change costly work rules. The proposed acquirer's plan also is subject to approval by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interstate Commerce Commission</ENAMEX>, the railroad's creditors and the bankruptcy court.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware & Hudson</ENAMEX>'s tracks extend to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Binghamton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sunbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX>. More important, the line has trackage rights on Conrail that allow its trains to reach connecting railroads at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware & Hudson</ENAMEX> suffers from circuitous routes, high labor costs and few major shippers.
An official of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CP Rail</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Pacific</ENAMEX>, declined to discuss the price and terms of its bid. The company previously said it would boost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware & Hudson</ENAMEX>'s north-south traffic between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
Closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guilford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Billerica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, operated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware & Hudson</ENAMEX> prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D&H</ENAMEX>'s bankruptcy filing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guilford</ENAMEX>, one of the line's largest creditors, said it would seek to reorganize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware & Hudson</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Springfield Terminal</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guilford</ENAMEX> unit with flexible work rules. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guilford</ENAMEX>'s proposal is likely to draw opposition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D&H</ENAMEX>'s 850 employees, who fear job losses and a resumption of rail labor-management strife.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Otsego</ENAMEX>, which has operated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D&H</ENAMEX> on an interim basis since the bankruptcy filing, has won praise from the line's shippers for improving service. The regional railroad said it would substantially boost the number of coast-to-coast container trains that use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D&H</ENAMEX> as part of a rail route involving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware Otsego</ENAMEX> and other railroads between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> ports.
Among the other bids was one presented by the chief executives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holt Cargo Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, a closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gloucester City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, marine terminal, warehouse and trucking concern, and of freight broker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf D. Barth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. Rail Port, the joint venture, seeks to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D&H</ENAMEX> trackage rights to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> to move import freight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware River</ENAMEX> ports now going by truck to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent P. Shoemaker</ENAMEX>, a former president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D&H</ENAMEX>, leads another bidder group that includes investment bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim Schroder</ENAMEX> and other interests. The group seeks to boost the line's traffic by hauling merchandise freight to Eastern markets and solid wastes to various landfills in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>.
