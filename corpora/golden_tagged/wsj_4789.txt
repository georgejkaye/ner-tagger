<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Products Inc.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Preston</ENAMEX> told securities analysts that company's 1989 sales will be $75 million to $90 million less than projected.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> said the shortfall reflects a decline in projected fourth-quarter revenue from gift, decorative and jewelry products. Such products normally account for 50% of fourth-quarter sales in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Last week, Avon disappointed analysts by cutting its forecast of 1989 earnings to a range of $1.95 to $2.15 a share from an earlier estimate of $2.30 to $2.40 a share.
``They are able to identify that it's a gift, decorative and jewelery-related problem, but they don't know exactly what went wrong,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Shore</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Inc.</ENAMEX> ``It will take a quarter before they find out exactly what the problem is and then another quarter to rectify. This means there could be another earnings disappointment between now and then.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shore</ENAMEX> said many of his fellow analysts were disappointed with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avon</ENAMEX>'s reduced earnings forecast. ``It's a never-ending saga,'' he commented.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon</ENAMEX> closed  at $31.75, down 50 cents.
Earlier this year, Avon rejected takeover bids from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irwin Jacobs</ENAMEX>. During that period, Avon management not only projected increased earnings but stated that Avon shareholders would benefit from cost efficiencies then being implemented. In August, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> to discuss Avon's future prospects. Following that meeting, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> said he was happy with the company's direction.
In response to a question as to whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX>'s $41-a-share offer still stood, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> replied, ``There was never a concrete offer, just a letter proposing we talk.''
On the plus side, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> said Avon had been successful in reducing corporate staff expenses from $74 million in 1988 to $61 million this year, reflecting in part the trimming of corporate staff from 808 employees to 634.
In 1988, Avon had a loss of $404.5 million on sales of $3.06 billion, reflecting $545.6 million in losses from discontinued operations.
