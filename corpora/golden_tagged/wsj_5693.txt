<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank PLC</ENAMEX>, continuing its retrenchment from low-margin U.S. businesses, agreed to sell its U.S. commercial-banking operation to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> for about $200 million.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operation, with 170 employees in 15 offices, had net income of $11 million last year on overall assets of $1.46 billion, for a return of about 0.8%. It represents about a third of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX>'s activities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
The sale reflects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX>'s strategy to divest itself of low-profit, overseas businesses to concentrate on higher-margin operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and elsewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. It also may blunt takeover speculation surrounding the bank, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s fourth-largest in assets.
The agreement also highlights the rising profile of Japanese banks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> The acquisition gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> -- the world's 25th-largest bank and one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s 13 major commercial banks -- an established U.S. network, staff and expertise to expand its business with medium-sized U.S. corporations. The transaction appears relatively low-cost: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa</ENAMEX> is paying roughly 1.66 times indicated book value for the business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX> said its U.S. commercial-banking business wasn't achieving returns on equity or assets targeted for the group world-wide. The business's return on net assets was a quarter of the bank's average, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operation's 8% return on equity was well below the 18% targeted by the bank as a whole.
``The return was perfectly respectable in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> but it just isn't good enough for us,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Thompson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX>'s deputy chief executive. ``We could get the same returns if we kept it all in cash in the money markets'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> added that the divestment reflects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX>'s previously announced plan to focus on four major business areas: retail banking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, financial services, corporate banking and private banking.
Banking industry analysts also said the higher cost of capital for European banks, which trade at much lower price-to-earnings ratios than Japanese competitors, makes far-flung operations increasingly unattractive for European institutions. Bankers estimate the average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British bank</ENAMEX>'s cost of capital is currently triple that for a Japanese bank. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX> has freed up # 800 million ($1.25 billion) in capital over the past five years through such transactions as selling its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanwa Bank Ltd.</ENAMEX> and closing its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government-securities primary dealership.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> said the divestment of the U.S. commercial-banking business could contribute to a Lloyds defense against any hostile takeover bid, a subject of continuing speculation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> markets. ``The defense {to a takeover} is performance; this is certainly part of maintaining that performance,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> said proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX> isn't planning any major acquisitions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX>'s biggest recent acquisition was last year's purchase of a 57% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abbey Life Group PLC</ENAMEX>, a British insurer, which sharply increased the bank's financial-services activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>.
The sale will leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds</ENAMEX> with about 350 employees in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> in foreign-exchange and other money-market operations, corporate lending and private banking. The divested commercial-banking network includes offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>.
