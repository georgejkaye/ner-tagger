<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> continued their nose-to-nose program-trading battle in August on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> displaced Kidder as the top user of the controversial computer-generated trading practice last month; the firms accounted for 89.1 million shares and 76.2 million shares, respectively, in August. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> outpaced second-place <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> by more than 20 million shares.
Overall, program trading accounted for 10.3% of average daily volume in August, up from 9.4% in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the exchange said. Program volume reached an average of 17.7 million shares daily, compared with 15.3 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> defines program trading as any of a number of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks.
Brokerage firms argue that strategies such as stock-index arbitrage -- rapid trading between stock-index futures and stocks to capture fleeting price differences -- link two related markets and thus benefit both. In August, 64.7% of program trades on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> involved index arbitrage, compared with 59.8% in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
Opponents contend that these strategies produce sharp market swings that frighten away small investors, and some argued that program trading contributed to the 1987 market crash.
Following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</ENAMEX>'s unit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> unit in August program trading were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Susquehanna Investment Group</ENAMEX> with 34 million shares; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>, 32.6 million; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston Group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> unit, 31.9 million.
