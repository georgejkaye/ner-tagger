The dollar slid against other major currencies as news reports and rumors inflamed concerns about the possibility of an interest rate increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and about a weekend meeting of finance chiefs from the Group of Seven industrialized countries.
Reports of another surprising intervention by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</ENAMEX> also disturbed the market. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> first caught participants off guard the day before by selling dollars even though the U.S. currency wasn't exhibiting particular strength.
Although many foreign-exchange traders still voiced skepticism that today's meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>'s central bank council will raise interest rates, the traders said participants aren't ready to buy dollars until the issue has been put to rest.
And, a report in a German financial newspaper indicated that the country's closely watched money supply figure grew faster than its target rate in August, heightening perceptions that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> must soon raise rates to clamp down on inflation pressures.
In addition, an unconfirmed story carried on a business news service quoted an unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> official saying that a new plan to curb the dollar's rise will be discussed at Saturday's meeting of G-7 finance officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. Traders greeted the report with much skepticism, but they said it helped raise tensions about the gathering's outcome.
``Most of the things that could happen would hurt the dollar,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Broyd</ENAMEX>, vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
In late afternoon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday, the dollar was at 1.9395 marks, down from 1.9545 marks late Tuesday, and at 145.13 yen, down from 145.85 yen. Sterling was at $1.5835, up from $1.5700.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Thursday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at 144.90 yen, down from Wednesday's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of 146.25 yen.
The dollar held steady through most of Wednesday's Asian trading, aided by the absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX>, whose interventions had in recent weeks become a daily fixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> trading. But the U.S. currency lost ground as European trading began and participants focused on prospects for the next day's Bundesbank meeting.
Traders' attention also was drawn early in European trading to the G-7 gathering, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyodo News Service</ENAMEX> reported from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> that the finance ministers of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> agreed the dollar's rise is ``troublesome.'' They were meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> for discussions ahead of the weekend's meeting.
The dollar slipped further when the West German business daily <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boersen-Zeitung</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> will announce that the nation's M3 money supply measure rose in August to an annualized rate of 5.25% from 4.9% in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. The August rate would exceed the target set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> for this year at around 5%.
Traders have long noted that inflationary pressures, not exchange rates, are the overriding factor in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>'s decision to raise rates, and the central bank is known to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M3</ENAMEX> figures attentively for indications of overheating.
So, the newspaper report, if borne out, increases the potential for German rates to rise today. However, many traders said such an increase would be politically inopportune before the G-7 meeting. Instead, the traders said, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> is more likely to tighten credit later.
Reports of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> intervention whacked the dollar as the currency was lifting off its lows below 1.9400 marks and helped knock it to a new low of 1.9345 marks, traders said. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s actions weren't in keeping with the market's perceptions of its recent primary goal -- to stem excessive rises in the dollar -- because the dollar exhibited little vigor, traders said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> may have other motives.
The most common theory is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> both wants to be seen intervening and would like a lower dollar before the G-7 meeting in order to reassure its partners in the group that the dollar is manageable and intervention coordination is effective.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, gold for current delivery settled at $364.90 an ounce, up $3.70. Estimated volume was heavy at five million ounces.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Thursday, gold was quoted at $363.15 an ounce.
