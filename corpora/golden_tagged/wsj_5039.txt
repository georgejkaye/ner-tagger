The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> is seeking a reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX>' investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX>, according to two people familiar with the situation.
The action by Transportation Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> could disrupt the pending $6.79 billion takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> by a labor-management group with backing from another foreign airline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX>.
At a breakfast meeting Friday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Checchi</ENAMEX> to reduce the dollar amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX>'s $400 million investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NWA</ENAMEX>, the same people said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> made the investment to help Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investor, finance a $3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX> that closed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> officials have voiced concerns about both the level of indebtedness and degree of foreign influence in recent airline takeovers.
Although foreign companies are limited to 25% ownership of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> accounted for 57% of the $700 million in equity raised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> for his purchase. Officially, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> owns only 5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> because its investment is mostly in nonvoting preferred stock. However, some outsiders have speculated that the dollar amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX>'s investment might enable it to wield substantial influence over the airline.
Rumors about possible changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM</ENAMEX>'s role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> sparked a sell-off in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> shares Friday. Their price tumbled $5.125 to $281.125 in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, on fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>'s $750 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> investment might have to be restructured along the same lines as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX>'s.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> declined to comment. A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> confirmed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> reviewed the findings of his agency's study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> takeover with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> on Friday. An announcement of those findings is expected sometime later this week.
One person familiar with the situation said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> is seeking a reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> investment from $400 million to $175 million, an amount that would equal 25% of the $700 million in equity raised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX>.
Some news reports said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> might also ask Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> to drop KLM from the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> board, submit financial reports monthly, instead of quarterly, and give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> veto power over any refinancing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>'s $3.35 billion in bank debt.
It didn't seem likely that any of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX>'s demands will pose any grave threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> or its financial health. But they have serious implications for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> takeover because its structure mirrors that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> will officially have only a 15% voting interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>, its equity contribution accounts for 78% of the total equity of $965 million.
According to the formal tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> released Friday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> investment is to be in three different securities. In theory at least, two of them could be reassigned to other investors to meet possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> concerns.
The three securities British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX> will receive are: a $300 million Class A preferred with an 18% dividend but no voting rights; a $200 million Class B preferred with a 13% dividend and no voting rights, and a $250 million junior preferred with no dividend, convertible into a 15% ownership stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United.</ENAMEX>
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> investment had to be reduced to 25% of the equity cash in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out, the first two preferred issues, which total $500 million with a combined dividend rate of 16%, could be attractive to other investors.
However, those outside investors might seek a voting equity stake as well, forcing changes on a fragile coalition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> management, the airline's pilot union, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>.
During the takeover battles for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> officials have repeatedly expressed concern about the questions of leverage and foreign-airline influence. But many takeover stock traders paid little heed because, until now, the officials' actions haven't matched their rhetoric.
The stock traders have been inclined to believe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> was merely trying to put on a show of investigating the issues in order to pre-empt criticism by congressional Democrats that the Bush administration was being too lenient in allowing the takeovers. If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> forces changes that cut the price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> takeover or cause it to unravel, their misjudgment could cost them dearly.
