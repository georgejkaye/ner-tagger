Democrats and civil-rights groups scored a victory earlier this year when they rejected President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s choice to be civil-rights chief. Now, the Republicans see a chance to settle the score.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> gears up to consider reversing the effect of a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decisions this June covering job bias, GOP lawmakers are lying in wait. They hope to use the debate not only to preserve the essence of the court decisions but to paint Democrats into a political corner by forcing them to defend such controversial positions as race-based quotas.
Those who oppose the court's decisions, charges Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orrin Hatch</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>), a senior member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX>, support ``equality of results and reverse discrimination instead of equality of opportunity and color blindness.''
These political divisions make it ``difficult to reach an early revision,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>). Civil-rights groups, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX> for the Advancement of Colored People, have made passage of the legislation a top priority, but, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAACP Executive</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Hooks</ENAMEX>, ``This may be a long-term fight, so we are digging in.''
The pending partisan struggle comes at a time when civil-rights advocates in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, having withstood the Reagan administration's assault on affirmative action, had hoped to be able to set their sights on the next generation of legislation. Instead, ``the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> is making the country refight the civil-rights battles that were won in the 1960s and 1970s,'' charges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Neas</ENAMEX>, executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.</ENAMEX>
The Democrats drafting the bills are trying to tiptoe around an explicit debate over affirmative action. They are, for instance, unlikely to include provisions aimed at reversing the effect of a ruling that struck down state and local government programs setting aside a certain number of contracts for minority-owned and women-owned businesses.
But Republicans are already labeling their efforts an endorsement of fixed percentages for minority hiring. ``The only alternative is to embrace quotas,'' says Wisconsin Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sensenbrenner</ENAMEX>, the ranking GOP member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary</ENAMEX> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s decisions, while not directly addressing the core of the controversy over affirmative action, sharply narrowed civil-rights laws covering employment discrimination and made the methods of proving violations much more difficult. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicans</ENAMEX>, including President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Thornburgh</ENAMEX>, have made clear that they don't believe remedial legislation is necessary. But when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lucas</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> sheriff who was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s nominee to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, agreed with the president's assessment, his rejection by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> along party lines was virtually guaranteed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicans</ENAMEX> were infuriated by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucas</ENAMEX>'s defeat -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> GOP Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> slammed it as ``crass political partisanship'' -- and have since redoubled their attacks on the Democratic plans. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatch</ENAMEX> calls the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decisions ``sound, reasonable and genuinely moderate'' and warns that if Democrats insist on trying to reverse them with legislation, he may do the same to cases from the 1970s that upheld affirmative-action plans.
Other Republicans believe they can use the debate over the civil-rights legislation to advance the cause of racially neutral, tax-based programs designed to foster economic growth among the poor, including enterprise zones and special venture-capital tax breaks for investments in poor areas. ``Quotas don't produce any meaningful results,'' says Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Gramm</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>). ``We need more jobs, more growth, more opportunity.''
``This is an opportunity for Republicans to change the emphasis in civil-rights policy to one that is more constructive, emphasizing economic opportunities,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Slobodin</ENAMEX>, a former GOP lawyer on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> now with the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Legal Foundation</ENAMEX>.
But Democrats are proceeding with plans to introduce their comprehensive bill later this month in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. ``We are going to have to respond to these assaults,'' says Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Edwards</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary</ENAMEX> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. ``We shouldn't be going around narrowing in a mean-spirited way these civil-rights laws that have worked for so many years.''
The legislation, which is still being drafted, is expected to require employers to justify their hiring practices when workers challenge them as discriminatory. That's the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> had interpreted the law from 1971 until last June, when it ruled in a case involving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> salmon canneries that workers bear the burden of discrediting the employer's justification for hiring practices.
To undo a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision that allowed white firefighters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, to challenge an eight-year-old, court-approved affirmative-action plan, the bill would also set a statute of limitations on bringing such challenges.
In addition, it would write into law previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rulings barring employment practices that are unintentionally discriminatory and
barring discriminatory terms and conditions of contracts between private parties. If enacted, the legislation would be the first substantial new law aimed at battling race-based job discrimination since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equal Employment Opportunity</ENAMEX> Act of 1972, which extended the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act to public and private employers.
Besides the opposition from its GOP critics in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the administration, the Democrats' bill will also likely be opposed by business interests, who fear it may go further than just overturning the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rulings. ``The hue and cry that resulted after those decisions was overblown,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Krebs</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> lobbyist. ``Those cases were a fine-tuning. Once you dip into it legislatively, you'll probably create more problems for us.''
Major Job-Bias Decisions of 1988-89 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> term:
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilks</ENAMEX>: Allowed, 5-4, workers to file new lawsuits claiming reverse discrimination under court-approved affirmative-action plans.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wards Cove Packing Co.</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atonio</ENAMEX>: Imposed, 5-4, tougher standards on employees trying to use statistics to prove discrimination.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patterson</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mclean Credit Union</ENAMEX>: Ruled, 5-4, that an 1866 civil-rights law, giving all citizens equal rights to make contracts, doesn't allow lawsuits involving harassment on the job or other conditions of employment.
