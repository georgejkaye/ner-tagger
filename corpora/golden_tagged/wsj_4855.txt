The dollar plunged on a round of concerted dollar selling by central banks. The central-bank intervention backed up a weekend warning by major industrial nations that continued dollar strength could hurt the world economy.
The dollar tumbled to 1.8993 marks and 142.13 yen in late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> activity, down sharply from 1.9510 marks and 146 yen late Friday. The pound climbed to $1.6170 from $1.5715 Friday.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Tuesday, the dollar opened for trading at 142.25 yen, down from Monday's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of 142.95 yen.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX>-of-Seven major industrial countries -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> -- issued a communique in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> on Saturday stating that the dollar's rise in recent months is ``inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals.''
The central banks launched their attack on the U.S. currency early yesterday with dollar sales by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Canada</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far Eastern</ENAMEX> trading. Dealers said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s central bank, intervened in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> markets through West German commercial banks.
The assault continued later in European trading, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>, plus the central banks of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, intervened. That, in turn, was followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> selling dollars in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market.
The central banks sent traders, international investors and corporations scrambling to unload dollars.
``Everybody and his brother were trying to sell dollars,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herwig Prielipp</ENAMEX>, chief dealer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DG Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>. The central-bank dollar sales, he added, ``took the market by surprise.'' Many analysts argue that the relatively high level of the dollar -- it has risen 14% against its Japanese counterpart and more than 7% against the West German currency since the end of last year -- threatens to undermine the four-year effort of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and its major trading partners to reduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade deficit and correspondingly large Japanese and West German surpluses. That's because a rising dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive and reduces the price of imports to American consumers.
But a stronger dollar helps reduce U.S. inflationary pressures. By keeping a lid on import prices, a strong dollar inhibits the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> manufacturers to raise their domestic prices.
The G-7 and other governments have intervened frequently during the past six months to try to stem the dollar's rise. But yesterday's action was different in several key respects. First, the dollar sales were taken at a time when the U.S. currency was softening, rather than rising. That suggests the G-7 nations are seeking to drive down the dollar from its recent levels, rather than merely stopping it from going higher. Second, the intervention had full support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>, which had been resisting coordinated intervention prior to the G-7 meeting, officials say.
``This was a demonstration that the process of coordination and cooperation is alive and well,'' one G-7 official said.
The dollar sales were planned by the seven major industrial countries at their meeting Saturday, government sources said. While the volume of intervention wasn't great, it nevertheless served as an effective protest against the U.S. currency's rise in recent months.
Also, traders said reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> intervened in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market for the first time since the Plaza Accord shocked Japanese institutional investors and dealers there. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plaza Hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> in September 1985, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> agreed to cooperate on pushing the dollar lower.
``Our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> people are surprised because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> intervened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoichi Sakaguchi</ENAMEX>, chief trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanwa Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``That was a key surprise.''
As is its policy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> declined to comment on its currency actions.
With yesterday's sales, the dollar is near the top of the trading band that many traders and economists say the G-7 strived to keep it in since early 1987. While never publicly disclosed, those ranges are believed to be 1.70-1.90 marks and 120-140 yen. However, central banks have repeatedly stressed that those bands are flexible. Indeed, the dollar has traded above the upper limits for much of this year.
Along with the intervention, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Otto Poehl</ENAMEX> said the dollar's fall corresponded with the G-7 communique. He also added to speculation that the West German central bank might raise interest rates. That would tend to lessen the dollar's allure to international investors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surprisingly</ENAMEX>, dealers said that with the possible exception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>, the dollar sales were relatively modest. They estimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> sold roughly $450 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and that combined central-bank sales during European trading came to $400 million to $500 million.
During <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> activity, bankers said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> intervened at the 1.9055-mark and 142.85-yen level, spending as much as $800 million.
The dollar bashing left currency traders and analysts divided over whether the U.S. currency will resume its climb toward the critical 2.00-mark and 150-yen levels. Some say it will -- they argue that the dollar is solidly supported by the buoyant American economy and relatively low U.S. inflation, while U.S. inflation-adjusted interest rates are high compared with those in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
Others, however, contend that the U.S. currency's startling resiliency this year has run its course and that central-bank intervention, coupled with prospects of a worsening U.S. trade picture, will spell a weaker dollar by year end.
The U.S. currency at one point yesterday traded as low as 1.8960 marks and 142.13 yen. The dollar has declined steadily since Sept. 15 when a combination of central-bank intervention and wild unsubstantiated rumors, such as the shooting of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and the collapse of a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> bank, sent it tumbling.
For most of last week, the market remained nervous while it awaited the results of this weekend's G-7 meeting. From its intraday highs on Sept. 15 to yesterday's lows, the dollar plunged 5.4% against the mark and 4.6% against the yen -- in just over six trading days.
Still, it isn't clear how committed the major industrial countries are to sustained intervention efforts. Officials wouldn't comment as to whether any new agreements about a trading range for the dollar were made at Saturday's meeting.
U.S. Treasury efforts to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to help bring down the dollar by lowering interest rates clearly haven't born fruit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> has made it clear to his G-7 colleagues that his policies will be geared to containing inflation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, not to pegging the dollar at any particular level.
``The verbal intervention and actual intervention G-7 is taking to push the dollar lower is working so far,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prielipp</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DG Bank</ENAMEX>. ``A month ago, everybody was telling me 2.20 {marks} was just around the corner.''
The big question is whether the major central banks can hold the dollar without having to resort to adjusting interest-rate policies. For the moment, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prielipp</ENAMEX> says they can if they want the dollar to trade in a range of 1.80-1.90 marks.
Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werner Gerbig</ENAMEX>, chief dealer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerzbank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, predicted the dollar would fall further during the next two weeks to 1.85-1.87 marks and end the year near 1.95 marks.
Nearly everyone expects the central banks to continue selling dollars as long as they feel it necessary. But many say those tactics, plus jawboning by officials, can only go so far. If <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> don't raise domestic interest rates and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> lowers rates ``this week, the dollar will resume going up slowly to the highs of two marks we had a few days ago,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Bianchi</ENAMEX>, a vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Bank of Switzerland</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Witten</ENAMEX>, vice president in charge of foreign-exchange operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, doubted whether even interest-rate changes would do the trick. ``The battle to get the dollar lower seems to be limited  to conventional weapons: intervention and jawboning; we sense a reluctance to use monetary policy to affect exchange rates,'' he said.
He and others also said that eventual interest-rate boosts abroad and lower U.S. rates had been discounted in the market.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Witten</ENAMEX> argued that higher West German and Japanese rates would only slow their respective economies, ``which will hurt trade.'' He added: ``Therefore, what you giveth to the U.S. trade structure by adjusting monetary policy, you take away by slowing down the European and Japanese economies.''
On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX>, gold for current delivery rose $3.60, to $369.80 an ounce, in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.4 million ounces.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Tuesday, gold was quoted at $367.45 an ounce.
