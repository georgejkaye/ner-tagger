<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors Co.</ENAMEX> said it signed an agreement in principle to acquire most of the beer-related assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh Brewery Co.</ENAMEX>
The move is in hopes of forging a strong competitor to dominant industry players <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch Cos.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller Brewing Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX>, by merging the two struggling brewers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Golden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, said it will assume debt and pay cash totaling $425 million for five breweries and several <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stroh</ENAMEX>'s brands, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stroh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schlitz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Milwaukee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schaefer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Signature</ENAMEX>. The accord must first pass muster with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antitrust Division</ENAMEX> and is subject to a definitive agreement.
Adding the brands of third-ranked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh</ENAMEX> will give fourth-ranked Coors the critical mass it needs to play with the big boys. But it doesn't necessarily give the company the marketing wisdom that it has apparently lacked in the past, analysts said. ``It's the only move they could make, and it's a great opportunity. But will they become a solid No. 3 player?'' asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Pirko</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bevmark Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based consulting firm. ``It's a formidable undertaking.''
The move would give Coors greater flexibility in production and synergies in marketing, and fills in product-line gaps that existed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Coors</ENAMEX>, chairman and president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> unit. ``If we're going to be a long-term player, we have to have more mass, more size,'' he said.
The merged company would have annual shipments of between 32 million and 36 million barrels a year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX> has annual shipments of about 80 million barrels, and Miller Brewing ships about 40 million barrels a year.
Some analysts said that the acquisition will significantly help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> in its marketing and production. ``They have been too small to afford the marketing dollars to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anheuser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emanuel Goldman</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. ``This puts them in the ballpark and makes them a major player.'' The new breweries will also cut the company's distribution costs, he said, making it possible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> to make and package its beer all over the nation.
If the acquisition is completed, the company will also gain a strong popular brand in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Milwaukee</ENAMEX>, the fifth-largest selling brand in the nation, and the top-selling malt liquor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlitz Malt Liquor</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> would net a couple of brands that are strong in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> to complement its current strength in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX>.
But, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> must still prove it is a world-class marketer, able to compete alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anheuser</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pirko</ENAMEX> and others note several times in the past when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> failed to capitalize on marketing opportunities. In the early 1970s, when light beers first leaped onto the sales charts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> missed the opportunity to market itself as the original light beer. The company also failed to market the draft aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX>, an advantage that Miller recognized in creating its new Miller Genuine Draft beer two years ago. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> failed to jump into the market with a dry beer, a variation that's doing well for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch</ENAMEX>'s brands.
Even though the merger will give the company the ``critical mass'' it needs to survive in the beer industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> will have its marketing dollars split among many brands with this acquisition, a problem that has similarly plagued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. Heilman Brewing Co.</ENAMEX>, now owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser</ENAMEX> can still be more efficient with their marketing because they have fewer brands, analysts said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> said it hasn't made any decisions yet about what brands it will aggressively promote and which ones it will let slide. Analysts, however, said they expect the company to focus its efforts on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stroh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Signature</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Milwaukee</ENAMEX> regular and light brands and on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schlitz Malt Liquor</ENAMEX>, possibly dropping the weakest brands, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Bull</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goebel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Silver Thunder</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> said it will continue to aggressively promote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keystone</ENAMEX>, its brand-new entry into the popular-priced segment, although analysts suggested that Keystone could easily cannibalize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Milwaukee</ENAMEX>.
While the new brands bring some regional strengths, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coors</ENAMEX> said the company will continue to market Coors nationally. He also said he doesn't know whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> will continue to use both its ad agencies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foote</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cone & Belding Communications</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSD&M</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh</ENAMEX>'s new ad agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal Riney & Partners Inc.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
If the acquisition is completed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> will carry debt on its balance sheet for the first time, although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coors</ENAMEX> said he isn't sure yet how much debt the deal will require. Currently the company has about $1 billion in assets and no debt.
Competitors are expected to try to block the acquisition, perhaps suing on antitrust concerns that the deal would result in too much concentration in the industry. Analysts, however, expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> will win in the long run. Spokesmen for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> said they didn't know whether the department would try to block the merger.
Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stroh</ENAMEX> will keep its non-beer beverage businesses, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sundance</ENAMEX> sparkling juices, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">White Mountain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Cooler wine coolers, as well as its Primo beer, sold largely in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. The company will also retain its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Van Nuys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, breweries, where those products are made.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stroh</ENAMEX> family has become increasingly involved in businesses outside the brewing industry in the past decade, including a couple of large real estate development investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> shares closed yesterday at $23.75, up $1.50, in national over-the-counter trading.
