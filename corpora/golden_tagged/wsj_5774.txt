Junk bond prices continued to fall yesterday, but trading activity in the high-yield bond market slowed considerably.
Bond traders estimated that at least 90% of the issues in the junk bond market didn't trade at all, while most of the remaining bonds fell between 1/4 point and 1/2 point, or between $2.50 and $5 for each $1,000 face amount.
There were, however, a few exceptions.
``There's beginning to be some buying interest in the better quality names,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lupo</ENAMEX>, a managing director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Upham & Co.</ENAMEX> He said the junk bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroger Co.</ENAMEX>, for example, rose yesterday by 1/4 point.
The high yield bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Holdings Capital Corp.</ENAMEX> also rose, despite reports that the firm's efforts to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp Venture</ENAMEX> Capital have stalled.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Holdings</ENAMEX>'s 14.7% convertible pay-in-kind securities maturing in 2009 closed 1/4 point higher at 95 1/2 while the company's subordinated discount debentures, maturing in 2001, were quoted up one point to 50 1/4.
But the gains in those and other so-called ``high-quality'' junk issues were small compared with last week's sharp declines that pushed some issues as many as four points lower on the week. Overall, junk prices tumbled about five points last week.
While the panic selling of last week is over, yesterday's slow trading is a sign that investors remained extremely nervous.
``Investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kingman Penniman</ENAMEX>, senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccarthy, Crisanti & Maffei</ENAMEX>. ``They are asking,'Is'Is this the lull before the hurricane, or has the storm passed?''' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penniman</ENAMEX> said. He said investors are especially concerned that individual investors will bail out of junk mutual funds, which, in turn, would force the funds to sell portions of their portfolio to meet redemptions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutual</ENAMEX> funds are among the largest holders of junk, accounting for about a quarter of the market. Large sales by the funds could push junk prices even lower.
Bargain hunters and so-called bottom fishers, investors who thrive on distressed or troubled securities, were scouring the junk market yesterday. But traders say the bargain hunters couldn't find junk holders willing to accept the low-ball bids they received.
``There are people trying to buy, but at prices that aren't being offered,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penniman</ENAMEX>.
News of financial woes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>, the Canadian real estate and retailing giant, jarred the junk bond market last week and sent some investors scurrying to the safe haven of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasurys</ENAMEX> and government-backed securities.
But that didn't happen yesterday. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> market, the benchmark 30-year government bond fell less than 1/8 point while municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities and investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged to as much as 3/8 point higher.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>'s innovative $1.5 billion premiere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> federal agency debt market, planned for today, is expected to meet with strong investor demand.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>, which makes loans to developing countries, is one of the world's largest debt issuers, with about $80 billion of outstanding borrowings denominated in a wide range of currencies.
Market talk is that the new bonds will yield.38 to.40 percentage point more than 10-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> notes, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Mohlere</ENAMEX>, director of agency trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> At that spread, he said, there's excellent demand. He added that the issue is already oversubscribed.
The 10-year bonds will be offered simultaneously in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> through an international, 14-member underwriting group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Ltd.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> has had characteristics of an agency borrower, including exemption from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> registration and the direct support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government. Until now, though, it always has borrowed in the U.S. corporate market, where it was classified as a ``Yankee,'' or non-U.S., borrower.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> has picked an ``opportune time'' for its first foray into the agency market, said one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based agency trader. He said that the markets ``have been jolted and roiled by the junk bond stuff'' and that investors will be lured to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> bonds because they see ``a scarcity of high-rated credits around... and people are familiar with the name.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
The falling value of the U.S. dollar pushed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities down about 1/8 point in quiet trading.
``The bottom line is the weaker dollar,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sullivan</ENAMEX>, director of money market research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> ``That's the only major influence in today's {yesterday's} trading.'' In part, the market is taking a breather after exhausting itself on Friday, he said.
On Friday, prices staged wild swings during a rumor-driven session after showing a mixed reaction to the heavy schedule of economic reports released that morning.
On the economic front, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> today will release the consumer price index and housing starts for August. Economists surveyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Capital Markets Report expect, on average, a 0.2% rise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CPI</ENAMEX> and a 1.4% increase in housing starts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPI</ENAMEX>, which measures inflation on the consumer level, should be slightly higher with the volatile food and energy sectors excluded, economists said.
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 100 10/32 to yield 8.085% compared with Friday's closing price of 100 14/32 to yield 8.074%. The latest 10-year bonds were quoted at a price of 99 9/32 to yield 8.086% compared with a price of 99 11/32 to yield 8.077% on Friday.
At the government's weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bill auction, rates on the three-month and six-month bills were unchanged from last week's auction.
Here are details of yesterday's auction:
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.
Both issues are dated Sept. 21. The 13-week bills mature Dec. 21, 1989, and the 26-week bills mature March 22, 1990.
Corporate Issues
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX>-grade corporate bonds ended between 1/8 to 1/4 point lower.
Among new issues, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX> issued $200 million seven-year notes offered at par to yield 9%.
Foreign Bonds Most European government bonds rebounded Monday as the value of the U.S. dollar fell against major currencies. But in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, bond prices ended weaker on talk that there will be a flood of selling later this week.
The end of this month marks the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s fiscal year, and participation has been curbed as accounts want to avoid risking losses that will show up in this period's results. There is talk that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s city banks are going to start selling from their Japanese government bond holdings. The banks are concerned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> will raise the discount rate, according to a salesperson at a Japanese bank.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s bellwether No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at a price of 95.35, down 0.24. The yield rose to 5.385%.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, government bonds rebounded from morning lows to end as much as 0.25 point higher. The upward move, after a week of falling prices, was led by professionals, primarily futures traders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s 6 3/4% bond due June 1999 rose 0.25 point to 98.75 to yield 6.92% while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 rose 0.125 point to 98.625 to yield 7.10%.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX>, government bonds ended moderately higher. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 13/32 to 113 22/32 to yield 9.87% while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s 12% bond due 1995 was 5/32 higher at 104 25/32 to yield 10.77%.
Mortgage-Backed Securities
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> made an unusual $215 million sale of mortgage securities yesterday afternoon, using loans from its $14 billion portfolio.
The 30-year and 15-year securities were sold in special auctions through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX>'s selling group of banks and securities dealers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> typically buys mortgages from originators and resells them immediately as mortgage securities. But some mortgages, which don't meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX>'s immediate pooling requirements, are held for sale at a later time.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> sold the $155 million of 30-year mortgage securities and $60 million of 15-year securities in addition to its regular daily auction of mortgage securities, which totaled $55 million yesterday.
The $155 million of 9 1/2% securities were sold at a price of 99 6/32.
The underlying mortgages apparently couldn't be sold immediately because their mortgage coupon rates were too high to be included in regular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> pools. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> limits the mortgages included in any single pool to a range of one percentage point.
The 9 1/2% 30-year securities have an underlying weighted average coupon rate of nearly 11%.
Traders said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> made similar mortgage sales from its portfolio last week.
Meanwhile, mortgage securities ended 1/32 to 3/32 lower, as they fared slightly worse than intermediate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities. This reversed the pattern of last week, when mortgages advanced more than Treasurys did.
Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> 9% securities for October delivery ended at 97 23/32, down 3/32; 9 1/2% securities at 99 25/32, down 3/32; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> 9% securities at 96 7/8, down 1/32.
Municipals
A supply crunch has pressured municipal bond prices gradually lower, with dollar bond issues now mostly 1/8 to 3/8 softer for the session.
With dealer shelves still well stocked after last week's pricing barrage, the market faces the task of absorbing more than $1 billion in new long-term debt over the next few days, including $894.5 million of bonds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dormitory Authority</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">State of New York</ENAMEX>.
The structure of the huge two-part bond offering was still not firmly established by late afternoon, according to lead underwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX> The issue may be tentatively priced today.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Jersey Turnpike Authority</ENAMEX> 7.20% issue of 2018 was 1/8 point weaker on the bid side at 97 5/8 to 97 3/4, yielding 7.39% based upon the offering, which was.02 of a percentage point higher than it was Friday afternoon.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Triborough Bridge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tunnel Authority</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, 7 1/8% issue of 2019 was off 1/4 at 96 1/4 to 96 1/2.
