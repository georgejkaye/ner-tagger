<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark Corp.</ENAMEX>, moving to finally take control of its recalcitrant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage Inc.</ENAMEX> subsidiary, ousted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s president and rearranged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s corporate structure.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>, a real estate and thrift concern, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh C. Shurtleff</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark director</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX> chairman, was named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX> president. He succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James R. Gilley</ENAMEX>, who was fired as president and chief executive officer. A new chief executive officer wasn't named for the unit, a manager of nursing homes and retirement centers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> also said its board has merged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s two subsidiaries into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s board has assumed control of the units' assets and operations.
The move reverses Monday's action by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>, in which it said it elected a dissident Southmark director to be chairman of the two units and had named other outside Southmark directors to the subsidiaries' boards. The move was intended to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> representation on the subsidiaries' boards without winning the approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>'s board or its management.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> owns 62.5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>. Earlier this month, it replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s board through shareholder consents and named Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shurtleff</ENAMEX> as chairman, succeeding Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilley</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> hadn't been able to take control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s assets because the stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s subsidiaries had been placed in a trust to be distributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX> stockholders.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>, which is operating under bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilley</ENAMEX> was fired for failing to respond to a majority of shareholders' demands for change. To take control of the company, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Southmark</ENAMEX> said that it placed a ``transition team'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s offices and sent some managers home for the day.
