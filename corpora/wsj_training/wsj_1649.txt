<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Chandler</ENAMEX>, in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book, likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher. When the champ has lost his stuff, the great mystery novelist wrote, ``when he can no longer throw the high hard one, he throws his heart instead. He throws something. He doesn't just walk off the mound and weep.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> might have been predicting the course of his own career. His last published novel featuring private detective <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Marlowe</ENAMEX>, the inferior ``Playback'' (1958), at times read almost like a parody of his previous work. When he died in 1959, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX> left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poodle Springs</ENAMEX> Story,'' which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque. ``Champ'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX>'s last pitch, apparently, was a screwball.
Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Parker</ENAMEX>, author of several best sellers featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spenser</ENAMEX>, a contemporary private eye in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> mold, has with the blessings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chandler</ENAMEX> estate been hired to complete ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poodle Springs</ENAMEX> Story.'' The result, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poodle Springs</ENAMEX>'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Putnam</ENAMEX>'s, 288 pages, $18.95) is an entertaining, easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> chronicle, full of hard-boiled wisecracks and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> color. If it does not quite have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chandler</ENAMEX>'s special magic -- well, at the end, neither did <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chandler</ENAMEX>.
As the book begins, a newly wed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> roars into the desert resort of Poodle (a.k.a. Palm) Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleetwood</ENAMEX>. His bride is the rich and beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Loring</ENAMEX>, a character who also appeared in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chandler</ENAMEX>'s ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Long Goodbye'' and ``Playback.</ENAMEX>'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> move into her mansion and can't keep their hands off each other, even in front of the Hawaiian/Japanese houseman. But the lovebirds have a conflict. He wants to continue being a low-paid private eye, and she wants him to live off the million dollars she's settled on him.
That's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chandler</ENAMEX>'s setup. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker</ENAMEX> spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poodle Springs</ENAMEX> high life, Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds. The supporting lineup is solid, the patter is amusing and there's even a cameo by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernie Ohls</ENAMEX>, the ``good cop'' of previous Chandler books who still doesn't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes. The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chandler</ENAMEX>'s prose at its most pared down. All told, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker</ENAMEX> does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect.
But there are grounds for complaint. At one point, the reader is two steps ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> in catching on to a double identity scam -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX> is supposed to be the pro. More bothersome, there are several apparent anachronisms. Contact lenses, tank tops, prostitutes openly working the streets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s. A little more care in re-creating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlowe</ENAMEX>'s universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable.
