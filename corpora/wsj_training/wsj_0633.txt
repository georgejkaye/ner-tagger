These are the last words <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie Hoffman</ENAMEX> ever uttered, more or less, before he killed himself. And You Are There, sort of:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABBIE</ENAMEX>: ``I'm OK, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>. I'm OK.'' (listening) ``Yeah. I'm out of bed. I got my feet on the floor. Yeah. Two feet. I'll see you Wednesday?... Thursday.''
He listens impassively.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABBIE</ENAMEX> (cont'd.): ``I'll always be with you, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>. Don't worry.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie</ENAMEX> lies back and leaves the frame empty.
Of course that wasn't the actual conversation the late anti-war activist, protest leader and founder of the Yippies ever had with his brother. It's a script pieced together from interviews by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> for a re-enactment, a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX>'s ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression.
The segment is soon to be broadcast on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> series ``Saturday Night With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung</ENAMEX>,'' thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news. It is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Journalism</ENAMEX> come to television.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX>'s program is just one of several network shows (and many more in syndication) that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events, using actors who are supposed to resemble real people, living and dead. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX>'s, however, is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie Hoffman</ENAMEX> in this case is to be played by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Lieber</ENAMEX>, who isn't new to the character. He was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> in a 1979 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> production of a play called ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> Conspiracy Trial.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television</ENAMEX> news, of course, has always been part show-biz. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broadcasters</ENAMEX> have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an audience. But, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Broadcast Group</ENAMEX> president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Stringer</ENAMEX> puts it, the network now needs to ``broaden the horizons of nonfiction television, and that includes some experimentation.''
Since its premiere Sept. 16, the show on which Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX> appears has used an actor to portray the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernon Johns</ENAMEX>, a civil-rights leader, and one to play a teenage drug dealer. It has depicted the bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> flight 103 over the Scottish town of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>. On Oct. 21, it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> correspondent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Anderson</ENAMEX>, who was abducted in March 1985 and is believed to be held in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>. The production had actors playing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> and former hostages <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Jacobsen</ENAMEX>, the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Weir</ENAMEX> and Father <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Jenco</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX> has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry. ``Prime Time Live,'' a new show this season featuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Donaldson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane Sawyer</ENAMEX>, has a studio audience that applauds and that one night (to the embarrassment of the network) waved at the camera like the crowd on ``Let's Make a Deal.'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ABC</ENAMEX> stops short of using an ``applause'' sign and a comic to warm up the audience. The stars do that themselves.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid Feders</ENAMEX> called ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,'' starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Shriver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Scarborough</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Alice Williams</ENAMEX>, that also gives work to actors.
Call it a fad. Or call it the wave of the future.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s re-creations are produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosgrove-Meurer Productions</ENAMEX>, which also makes the successful prime-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC Entertainment</ENAMEX> series ``Unsolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mysteries</ENAMEX>.''
The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless. News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program. Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that. Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated ``tabloid TV'' shows as ``A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Current</ENAMEX> Affair,'' which is produced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> That show, whose host is Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung</ENAMEX>'s husband, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maury Povich</ENAMEX>, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chambers</ENAMEX> murder case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Lowe</ENAMEX> tapes, what have you.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Stone</ENAMEX>, the executive producer of ``A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Current</ENAMEX> Affair,'' says, ``We have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how to present the news.''
Nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX>. At 555 W. 57th St. in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, one floor below the offices of ``60 Minutes,'' the most successful prime-time news program ever, actors wait in the reception area to audition for ``Saturday Night With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> sends scripts to agents, who pass them along to clients. The network deals a lot with unknowns, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Wentworth</ENAMEX>, who portrayed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Alton</ENAMEX> as Father <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenco</ENAMEX>, but the network has some big names to contend with, too. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Earl Jones</ENAMEX> is cast to play the Rev. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johns</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ned Beatty</ENAMEX> may portray former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Brown</ENAMEX> in a forthcoming epsiode on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caryl Chessman</ENAMEX>, the last man to be executed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, in 1960.
``Saturday Night'' has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen-agers to a Nov. 4 segment on a man named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willie Bosket</ENAMEX>, who calls himself a ``monster'' and is reputed to be the toughest prisoner in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX>, which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks, now hires featured actors beginning at $2,700 a week. That isn't much compared with what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cosby</ENAMEX> makes, or even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung</ENAMEX> for that matter (who is paid $1.6 million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom ``Murphy Brown''). But the money isn't peanuts either, particularly for a news program.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middletown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, with something less than a cast of thousands. It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras. On Oct. 20, the town's mayor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Reid</ENAMEX>, made an announcement on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> during half-time at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middletown High School</ENAMEX> football game asking for volunteers.
``There was a roll of laughter through the stands,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Sukle</ENAMEX>, the editor of the weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Press and Journal</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middletown</ENAMEX>. ``They're filming right now at the bank down the street, and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards. They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a docudrama.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sukle</ENAMEX> says he wouldn't dream of participating himself: ``No way. I think re-enactments stink.''
Though a re-enactment may have the flavor, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> on the Hudson it isn't. Some producers seem tentative about the technique, squeamish even. So the results, while not news, aren't exactly theater either, at least not good theater. And some people do think that acting out scripts isn't worthy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX>, which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry.
In his review of ``Saturday Night With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Shales</ENAMEX>, the TV critic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and generally an admirer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>, wrote that while the show is ``impressive,... one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take.''
Re-creating events has, in general, upset news traditionalists, including former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard S. Salant</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuven Frank</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> anchorman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Cronkite</ENAMEX> and the new dean of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Joan Konner</ENAMEX>. Says she: ``Once you add dramatizations, it's no longer news, it's drama, and that has no place on a network news broadcast.... They should never be on. Never.''
Criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie Hoffman</ENAMEX> segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man. That includes his companion of 15 years, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johanna Lawrenson</ENAMEX>, as well as his former wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anita</ENAMEX>. Both women say they also find it distasteful that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> is apparently concentrating on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX>'s problems as a manic-depressive.
``This is dangerous and misrepresents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie</ENAMEX>'s life,'' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrenson</ENAMEX>, who has had an advance look at the 36-page script. ``It's a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself.''
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> says that dramatization ``makes the truth flexible. It takes one person's account and gives it authenticity.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> interviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Hoffman</ENAMEX> and his sister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis</ENAMEX>, as well as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX>'s landlord in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Solebury Township</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa</ENAMEX>. Also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Silvers</ENAMEX>, who collaborated with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> on two books.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silvers</ENAMEX> says, ``I wanted to be interviewed to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbie</ENAMEX>'s story out, and maybe talking about the illness will do some good.''
The executive producer of ``Saturday Night With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Chung</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Lack</ENAMEX>, declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show, in particular. ``I don't talk about my work,'' he says. The president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David W. Burke</ENAMEX>, didn't return numerous telephone calls.
One person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> to comment on a ``work in progress,'' such as the Hoffman re-creation, but says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> is ``aware'' of the concerns of Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrenson</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX>'s former wife. Neither woman was invited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> that is to follow the re-enactment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lieber</ENAMEX>, the actor who plays Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX>, says he was concerned at first that the script would ``misrepresent an astute political mind, one that I admired,'' but that his concerns were allayed. The producers, he says, did a good job of depicting someone ``who had done so much, but who was also a manic-depressive.
