<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker Corp.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to sell its Bostik chemical adhesives unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orkem S.A.</ENAMEX>, a French chemical company, for $345 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bostik</ENAMEX> is the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emhart Corp.</ENAMEX> unit to be sold as part of the power-tool manufacturer's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emhart</ENAMEX> earlier this year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX> said it plans to put other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emhart</ENAMEX> units on the block in the future, with the goal of raising $1 billion in net proceeds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX> rescued <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Emhart</ENAMEX> from the takeover bid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Topper Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $2.8 billion.
The move significantly expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX>'s product line, but also significantly increased its debt load. The acquisition boosted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX>'s ratio of debt to total capital to more than 80%. Company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than 50% over the next 2 1/2 years.
Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX> put three Emhart businesses on the auction block: the information and electronics segment, the Dynapert electrical assembly business and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mallory Capacitors</ENAMEX>. The three units had combined 1988 sales of about $904 million. The three units contributed about a third of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emhart</ENAMEX>'s total sales.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX> had said it would sell two other undisclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Emhart</ENAMEX> operations if it received the right price. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bostic</ENAMEX> is one of the previously unnamed units, and the first of the five to be sold.
The company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year. The five units generated sales of about $1.3 billion in 1988, almost half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emhart</ENAMEX>'s $2.3 billion revenue. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bostic</ENAMEX> posted 1988 sales of $255 million.
``Our divestiture program is on schedule, and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $1 billion in net proceeds,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nolan D. Archibald</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive officer, in a statement.
The sales are an attempt to quell investor concern about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX>'s increased debt burden from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emhart</ENAMEX> purchase. The company's stock plunged when it first announced that it planned to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emhart</ENAMEX>.
The company maintains that it doesn't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emhart</ENAMEX> to contribute to earnings for about another 12 months.
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black & Decker</ENAMEX> closed at $19.75 yesterday, down 25 cents. The company didn't announce the sale until after the close of the market.
