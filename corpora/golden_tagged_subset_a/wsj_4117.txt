Chevrolet has a pickup truck it wants to sell as, pardon the expression, a sports car. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> is spiffing up its practical minivan with ``more leather than a limousine.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> promises to give consumers ``something you've always wanted in a performance car -- your family.''
Such blurring of once-distinct market segments will be a hallmark of the 1990 model year, which technically started yesterday, as auto makers increasingly seek incremental sales in a proliferating number of slender niches.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX>'s 454 SS pickup, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s Town and Country minivan and, at least initially, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX>'s new-generation Stanza compact car aren't expected to sell in large numbers. But they are part of an effort to create vehicles for every viable market, some tiny. A luxury minivan may represent ``a few thousand {sales}, or double that, I don't know,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald R. Boltz</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> vice president. But, he adds with a smile, ``it's profitable.''
One way to lure niche dwellers is with exotic -- and sometimes quixotic -- features. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler-Benz AG</ENAMEX> is targeting the hay-fever set by equipping its new two-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> convertibles, the 300SL and 500SL, with electrostatic filters in the ventilation system. The filters, most functional when the top is up, will cleanse interior air of pollen and dust.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> has also equipped the convertibles with a padded roll bar that pops up, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> style, ``just before it is needed... to provide increased occupant protection in a rollover accident,'' the company says. The computer-controlled system also automatically locks safety belts and unlocks (but doesn't unlatch) doors ``to facilitate rescue efforts if needed,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> adds.
On a more mundane note, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Pontiac division is adding a ``brake feel improvement package'' to some Lemans subcompacts, following customer complaints that the brakes didn't respond as drivers expected. Does this mean the old brakes didn't work right? ``Oh, no, the braking was adequate,'' says a spokeswoman. ``We just enhanced the feel of it.''
Such efforts, marginal as they may seem, are important at a time when some industry officials forecast that 1990 model year sales will fall 5% to 14.2 million vehicles. Sales for the 1989 model year, to be released Wednesday, are expected to total 15 million cars and trucks.
But for most auto makers, low-volume products with high-profile features must be balanced by more broadly adaptable, core vehicles. In the 1990 model year, almost a dozen makers will introduce new bread-and-butter small and midsized cars, including a next-generation Escort from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s new Accord, four-door models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s midsized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-10 family cars -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> Regal, Oldsmobile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cutlass Supreme</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prix</ENAMEX> -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Passat</ENAMEX>, the largest car Volkswagen has ever sold.
All this will make 1990 ``definitely'' harder for auto makers, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Peterson</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autopacific Group</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newport Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, market research firm. ``It's going to be tough for these guys to get enough attention to sell the kinds of volume they've come to expect.''
Families in particular will be bombarded with sales pitches from import and domestic manufacturers promising value for price and room for at least four people in everything from new vans to quasisports cars. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> will generate the biggest barrage as it finally unveils the four-door <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-10s, along with variations of its plastic-body minivan for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX>.
The two-door <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-10s haven't sold up to expectations, so the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s $5 billion investment in the cars rests with the sedans, which carry the same names as their coupe counterparts.
Success won't come easily, and not just because of the challenge from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>'s new, larger Accord sedan. Smaller families can choose from many redesigned subcompact and compact cars, including the 323 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protege</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyundai Motor Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> is trying to distinguish the next-generation Stanza compact from its slow-selling forebear -- and from the rest of the pack -- by offering more power for less money. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> cut Stanza's base price to $11,450 from more than $12,000 and added a four-cylinder, 12-valve engine that generates 138 horsepower, up from 94 horsepower for the old standard engine.
Buyers who prefer domestic nameplates and who aren't in a hurry can wait until spring, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> will introduce its new Escort. The car isn't all-American, however: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda</ENAMEX>, of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> owns 25%, did much of the engineering on the vehicle.
The most widely publicized luxury cars of the new model year are clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX>'s Infiniti line, which goes on sale Nov. 8, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>'s Lexus cars, which have been available since August. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Imperial</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, with the redesigned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> Town Car, also are introducing important upscale models. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> has taken a conservative approach to Imperial's styling, partly because it shares many parts and features with the boxy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boltz</ENAMEX> says this is also because Imperial was consciously fashioned for older buyers, many of whom now own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> cars or want to stick with a U.S.-made product. Thus, rather than join European auto makers in what many analysts see as a dogfight for market share with Lexus and Infiniti, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> decided to ``first serve our existing owner base,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boltz</ENAMEX> adds. ``Over time, we will offer other entries that will appeal to younger {luxury-car} buyers,'' which Lexus and Infiniti are expected to attract.
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> isn't ignoring the competition. Imperial ads will compare the car's features -- favorably, of course -- to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cadillacs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jaguars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bmws</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> will also emphasize features in its Town Car ads. The Town Car has been one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s most profitable vehicles, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> wants to reassure owners that the ``traditional luxury cues of size, luggage capacity and ride'' haven't disappeared beneath the new, rounder skin designed to broaden the Town Car's appeal, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross H. Roberts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>-Mercury general manager.
Thus, Town Car ads will show how roomy the trunk is and how luxurious the interior remains. ``It's a very delicate balancing act,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian G. Mcallister</ENAMEX>, the division's marketing manager.
Competition in the luxury segment is expected to be so fierce that several companies are offering new, ``entry-level'' models in hopes of attracting more buyers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX> has revived the 318 name for its new 318is two-door, 16-valve car, which it will begin selling next May for about $22,000. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX>'s current prices range from almost $25,000 to $70,000. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> removed the sunroof, special suspension system and real wood interior trim from its $44,000 XJ6 sedan to come up with a ``base'' model that will retail for $39,700.
Sports cars are getting lots of attention, some of which Chevy would like to grab for its 454 SS pickup. The full-sized, limited-edition model has a 230-horsepower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">V</ENAMEX>-8 engine and a ``performance handling package'' with special shock absorbers, front stabilizer bar and ``heavy-duty jounce bumpers.''
Chevrolet expects the 454 SS to attract mainly men of ``moderate'' education in their early to mid-40s who long for the American-made muscle cars of their youth, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank F. Raine</ENAMEX>, marketing manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> trucks. ``No Harvard professors,'' he adds.
Those who want their sports cars in more traditional guises can choose from a growing number of other two-seaters from makers including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes-Benz</ENAMEX>'s offerings are among the priciest, with the six-cylinder engine 300SL and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">V</ENAMEX>-8 engine 500SL expected to go on sale Nov. 1 for roughly $70,000 and $80,000. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>'s offering, a mid-engine teardrop Acura model code-named <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NS</ENAMEX>-X, won't be available until the middle of next year and will likely cost $50,000 to $60,000.
The new entries mean more choices for consumers but possible headaches for manufacturers. ``I don't think the market for two-seat sports cars is infinitely expandable,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Lutz</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Motors.</ENAMEX> But his company is hard at work figuring out how to turn its two-seat Viper from concept car to reality.
pressuring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>, which dominates the minivan market with its regular and extended-body <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caravans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Voyagers</ENAMEX>. standards, manufacturers continue to stuff their products with bigger engines, including Cadillac, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX>, which gets its first V-8 in the Quattro. for the first time with the 300E 4Matic sedan and 300TE 4Matic station wagon. A safety feature as well as a profitable option, four-wheel drive expends to other models including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Galant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMC</ENAMEX> minivans. virtually every car sold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> this year, due to government mandate. Some cars with air bags carry warnings that drivers should continue to buckle up. But automatic belts also aren't completely automatic: Most systems lock in shoulder, but not lap, belts.
