Does anyone believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank System</ENAMEX> will be the only bank to stub its toe, or worse, on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX>?
This week the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> concern became the first banking company with serious, although still quite manageable, problems related to the booming leveraged buy-out business. Although bank lending to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX> has mushroomed, banks in general have yet to be tarred by it.
And many analysts believe they won't be. Banks are senior to junk-bond lenders, with a higher priority claim. Their LBO loans are secured by assets, and they are diversified across the breadth of American industry. ``I don't expect Lbos to be a major problem for many banks,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Mahoney</ENAMEX>, a bank analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service.</ENAMEX>
But the reasons for comfort with respect to banks in general also apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> -- or at least, they were supposed to. In fact, the company had been trumpeting its newly cautious approach to credit for several years. Thus analysts were taken aback by its sudden decision to increase the amount of loans it classifies as nonperforming (mostly LBO-related) by about $83 million.
Few people expect that Lbos will become a crisis on the scale of the industry's loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> or to the energy patch. But that still leaves plenty of room for trouble.
``We can expect to see more troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lbos</ENAMEX> and higher levels of nonperforming assets caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahoney</ENAMEX> says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper Jaffray & Hopwood</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven R. Schroll</ENAMEX> goes further: ``Other banks are going to catch up,'' he says. ``In my estimation a lot of other banks are going to have the same problem.''
Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX>'s chairman resigned. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> had indicated Monday that up to 11% of its leveraged buy-out-related loans were ``nonperforming,'' or bad. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piper Jaffray</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroll</ENAMEX>, the departing chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.H. Ankeny Jr.</ENAMEX>, was intent on making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> a ``newage commercial bank on the leading edge of banking in the 1980s.'' Its loans to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX> and other highly leveraged deals -- some said to be originated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX>, some syndicated by others -- grew 32%, to $738 million, in the first six months of 1989.
Analysts believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX>'s problem loans stem from at least three 1987 Lbos. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Namely</ENAMEX>, Seaman Furniture, a furniture retailer acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</ENAMEX> that has missed interest payments on its bonds; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Heileman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> brewer bought by the now-troubled, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips Beverage Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> liquor distributor acquired by its management. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Phillips</ENAMEX>, the company's chairman, is on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX>'s board.
None of the three companies would comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> also declined to identify its problem borrowers. It said it is increasing the amount of loans it classifies as nonperforming and boosting the ``associated charge-offs... as a result of a few loans in the company's portfolio of highly leveraged transactions.'' Among other changes, it said it would ``seriously consider eliminating'' riskier lines of business. Analysts think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> will concentrate on more standard commercial and retail banking and leave Lbos for the big boys.
And the big boys are increasing their exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lbos</ENAMEX> -- which they lump under a broad category known as ``highly leveraged transactions.'' At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX>, one of the more aggressive players, Hlts account for 23% of domestic commercial business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Pacific</ENAMEX> increased its exposure 44% in the first half of 1989. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX>'s rose 22% in the second quarter alone.
And LBO loans are proving riskier than average. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>, 7.5% of highly leveraged loans are troubled, or ``nonperforming,'' compared with only 5% for all domestic loans. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX>, 3.2% of LBO-related loans are nonperforming, compared with 2.2% overall. (The figures are better at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan</ENAMEX>; only 0.4% of LBO loans are nonperforming, far less than its average overall).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX>, like others, finds comfort in the fact that its LBO loans are mostly small (they average about $36 million) and spread across 25 industry groups and close to 100 borrowers. Of those, only one is classified as ``nonperforming.'' However, that loan -- said to be to failed drugstore operator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> -- is for roughly $102 million.
Only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX>, one of the most eager bidders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lbos</ENAMEX>, has run up significant losses, according to a report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>. It had ``highly leveraged transaction'' charge-offs of $57.4 million in the first half of 1989, an annual rate of 3.6%.
``The entire amount was from two transactions from medium-sized companies in which we were the sole lender,'' a bank spokesman says. ``The prior seven to eight years we have been in the business, losses have been minimal.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lbos</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> and others, also have been profitable. Fees are larger and interest rates are 1 1/2 percentage points higher than on other corporate loans, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX>.
The potential problem, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> demonstrated, is that problem loans can develop in bunches. In a broad economic downturn, diversification might fail to work. ``In a recession, even so-called good deals could get in trouble,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keefe Bruyette</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mcdermott</ENAMEX>. And in a general business slowdown, the value of assets securing loans is likely to drop.
The notion that banks won't suffer any loss of principal until junior creditors have lost their entire stake is accurate only in theory. ``Theoretically junk debt gets wiped out first, but when push comes to shove, quite often the senior debtors have to give something up,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor's</ENAMEX> Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Aran</ENAMEX>.
Also, the buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> and the pending buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> involve no junk bonds -- the debt comes entirely from banks. If junk markets remain skittish, ``the banks' profiles in deals will have to increase if the deals are going to get done,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keefe Bruyette</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdermott</ENAMEX>. Will banks take on added risk if it's the only way to accomplish big-fee deals? The banks say no. What is unnerving about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> is that -- after a series of mishaps in energy, real estate and agriculture loans, and a disastrous wrong-way bet on interest rates, it, too, believed it was taking a conservative stance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX>'s annual report says that ``a change in approach and culture was heightened in 1986 when the company undertook a comprehensive review of the loan portfolio... and developed a monitoring and examination system.'' The company's highly leveraged loans, in particular, ``generated heightened awareness and increased concerns regarding the potential risk in such lending,'' the annual report says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Crabtree</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dain Bosworth</ENAMEX>, says the change of heart was for real. ``The credit culture has changed a lot over the last couple of years,'' he says. ``They tried to develop an anticipatory strategy to get bad loans off their books before they ended up being bad losses. The logical question is,'Why didn't they catch these things coming?' This is a big surprise.''
Junk bonds' recent distress isn't likely to spark a profusion of stock offerings any time soon, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Einhorn</ENAMEX>, a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX>.
During <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s cash squeeze last week, some analysts were predicting that growing numbers of companies would avoid issuing high-yield junk and return to the equity markets for capital. The timing seems right, with the stock market trading near record highs. A big cyclical company, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, could raise money in the stock market, reduce debt and cut interest expense, slash fares and undercut debt-laden competitors.
But debt securities will remain in vogue as long as the economy chugs along outside of recession territory, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einhorn</ENAMEX>. ``In a long business expansion,'' he notes, ``there is a tendency to forget what the fixed cost of debt can do in a recession.''
In the next 15 months, withdrawals of stock from the market will still outpace new issues, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Einhorn</ENAMEX> predicts. That's a bullish factor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX>'s market strategist figures that two to three percentage points of the market's 15% gain in the first half was caused by diminished supplies of stocks.
