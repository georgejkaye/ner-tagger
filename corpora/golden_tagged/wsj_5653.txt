<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nederlandsche Middenstandsbank N.V.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMB)</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postbank N.V.</ENAMEX> said they completed arrangements for their intended merger and will sign official agreements on Oct. 4.
The Dutch banking companies said they then plan to split their post-merger shares 5-to-1 if shareholders approve the merge and split at a special meeting called for Oct. 5. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Approval</ENAMEX> is expected.
The completion of the merger had previously been expected in September, but developed a last-minute hitch because of disagreements among different unions representing employees at the companies. Those problems were resolved last week.
