One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX> over the past five months has been the lack of international attention. The deportation of more than 315,000 men, women and children by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years. Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry: that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century. Today's Turks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>, in other words, deserve what is coming to them four centuries later.
As if this weren't enough, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> is getting into the act. On Tuesday it approved Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>'s proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24, 1990, as the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Day of Remembrance</ENAMEX> of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923,'' suffered at the hands of the warring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX>.
There can be no quibbling that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Armenians</ENAMEX> endured terrible suffering, but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve. It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>, a country that has been one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s strongest allies in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>. The resolution also comes at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> has been seeking help from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> in resolving its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> has been fighting its past for years, and thus far has been only partially successful. Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people? Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> that surfaced when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> asked for assistance in dealing with its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgarian</ENAMEX> emigration crisis.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s odd effort notwithstanding, most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>'s political problems lie with the Europeans. Part of the problem some Europeans have with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> seems to stem from its location -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> isn't really part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. Why, they wonder, should it belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>? Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>, we are told, is not a Christian nation; its people simply won't fit in with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western European</ENAMEX> Judeo-Christian tradition. It's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> comes to the fore.
No one has to accept the sins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ottoman Empire</ENAMEX> to reject that argument. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> in any event is long past it. The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kurds</ENAMEX>, suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> have inundated eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>. Now it is their fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turks</ENAMEX> arriving as refugees from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>.
The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently. Surely, the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten. But what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX> has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>'s government has been behaving beyond the pale for months, and the U.S. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past.
