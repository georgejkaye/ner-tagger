A former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sperry Corp.</ENAMEX> marketing executive, admitting his role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> procurement scandal, pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $400,000 to a midlevel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> acquisition official during the early 1980s.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lavelle</ENAMEX>, who at the time was the marketing director for Sperry in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Clearwater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, admitted participating in a scheme to bribe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland Tomlin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> official. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomlin</ENAMEX>, who left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> in 1985, pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy, bribery and tax-evasion charges.
The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985, according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavelle</ENAMEX>'s guilty plea in federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX> Sperry merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burroughs Corp.</ENAMEX> to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys Corp.</ENAMEX> in late 1986.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court</ENAMEX> documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomlin</ENAMEX> tried to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomlin</ENAMEX>, among other things, illegally provided Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavelle</ENAMEX> with inside information and documents intended to give Sperry an unfair advantage in the competition, the documents said. Sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work.
Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavelle</ENAMEX> and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained ``approval of the scheme'' from more-senior Sperry officials ``because the payment which {Mr.<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">} Tomlin</ENAMEX> requested was so large.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Gardner</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> vice president, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Neal</ENAMEX>, a former company consultant, have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> has said that all of the company officials who participated in improper activities have left the company.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lavelle</ENAMEX> faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $500,000 fine.
