Talks between cocoa producing and consuming countries on a plan to support the depressed world price of cocoa collapsed Saturday when a compromise package failed to win sufficient backing.
``We haven't achieved a package. We are where we stood on Monday when the talks began,'' said the consumers' spokesman at the end of the meeting of the 41-nation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Cocoa Organization</ENAMEX>.
The deal would have opened the way to introduction of a stockpiling scheme to tighten supplies and raise prices. Producing countries would have received financial help from the cocoa organization to hold back from the glutted market as much as 120,000 metric tons of surplus beans. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds.
Traders said the price of cocoa -- mainstay of the economies of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ghana</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> -- is already close to a 14-year low and is likely to slump when world markets reopen Monday.
The producers' spokesman blamed the 12-nation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Economic Community</ENAMEX> -- the world's biggest importing bloc with a 50% share -- for the failure of the talks. He said the package of measures wasn't voted on because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> said it would abstain.
The two sides are scheduled to meet again in December when informal discussions are likely to take place on the future of producer-consumer cooperation.
The price of cocoa has been depressed by five seasons of overproduction.
