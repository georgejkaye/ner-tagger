The recent history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> has all the makings of some of the bad movies this <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> studio has been churning out the past several years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> has been losing tons of money on such monumental box-office bombs as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ishtar'' and ``Leonard Part VI.</ENAMEX>'' Casting for new studio executives has been almost a constant exercise as frustrated 49%-owner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> tried in vain to convert its legendary ability to sell soft drinks into making and marketing films.
So is Coke wringing its hands over this experiment in diversification? Hardly. It looks as if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> could reap about $1.2 billion in proceeds from its adventure in filmmaking.
Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, the studio's parent company, announced that it is in discussions with a company it wouldn't identify involving a cash purchase of all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s outstanding shares. Entertainment industry sources identify the bidder as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, after a year of on-again, off-again haggling over price, has offered about $26 to $28 a share for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, or more than $3 billion, according to people in the entertainment industry. They say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> is prepared to accept that price unless it gets a better offer fast. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> itself declines to comment.)
Analysts suspect there may still be more bidders, as the entertainment industry goes through a period of global consolidation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> stock jumped $5.25 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday, to $26.375. Rumors swirled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> might enter the bidding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, but through a spokesman he said he wasn't interested.
With the recent sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, and the purchase three years ago of 20th <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Fox</ENAMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>, ``there are only really three players left to go -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orion''</ENAMEX> -- in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mara Balsbaugh</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co.</ENAMEX> ``This refocuses attention on these companies as valuable and increasingly rare.''
The floundering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> studio notwithstanding , the parent company is full of valuable assets.
Among those assembled by chief executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Kaufman</ENAMEX> are one of the most successful television production and distribution businesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, with a wide array of episodes of such popular series as ``Who's the Boss?'' ``Designing Women'' and ``Married... With Children.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Television</ENAMEX> has five new series on the networks this season, more than any other studio. Such an operation is increasingly lucrative as the demand grows world-wide for U.S. television shows and films.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> also owns a vast library of theatrical films, a large distribution network and one of the nation's largest chains of movie theaters.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, which in 1987 spent $2 billion to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX>, getting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> would cap an ambitious campaign to marry its consumer electronics hardware products with the crucial entertainment ``software'' that drives sales and new products.
The risks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> or any other potential purchaser of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> lie mainly in the unpredictable losses of the film studio. With that in mind, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> last year bid in the low 20s per share for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. But talks broke down after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>, which along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> management and directors, actually controls 54% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s voting shares, indicated it would hold out  for as much $35 a share. By now making a higher bid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, which has been getting more and more eager to acquire a studio, has apparently decided to accept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s projections that it will substantially improve its results and its cash flow in 1990. For the first quarter of fiscal 1990 ended May 31, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s earnings were down 53% to $2 million, and revenue fell 14% to $351.1 million.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> increased its market share at the box office this summer, the turnaround at the studio is far from complete. New studio chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dawn Steel</ENAMEX> has yet to release most of the films she has put into production since she was hired to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Puttnam</ENAMEX> in late 1987, and many of the films she has released or has in the pipeline are remnants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puttnam</ENAMEX> era.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puttnam</ENAMEX> was a successful British film producer of such tony movies as ``Chariots of Fire'' and ``The Killing Fields,'' but his 18-month reign at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> was a disastrous setback for the company despite some critical acclaim. In addition to alienating many key <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producers, actors and agents, he put into production a number of films that were either complete flops or unreleasable in most <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> markets.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steel</ENAMEX> has worked to put Columbia back in the mainstream this year, producing two big sequels to previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> hits. But while ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ghostbusters II</ENAMEX>'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karate Kid III</ENAMEX>'' combined have sold about $150 million of tickets, neither was as successful as expected. Another Columbia summer film, ``When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Met Sally</ENAMEX>,'' is a big success with more than $78 million in ticket sales, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> has to share its revenues with the producer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Rock Entertainment</ENAMEX>.
Meanwhile, the first major original film that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steel</ENAMEX> put into motion when she arrived at the studio, the $25 million ``Casualties of War,'' has been a major disappointment, selling less than $18 million of tickets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tri-Star Pictures</ENAMEX> unit -- which until this year was a stand-alone studio -- has had its share of disappointments, including the expensive flop ``Lock-Up,'' starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvester Stallone</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Firestone</ENAMEX>, who oversees the entertainment investment fund at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity Management & Research Co.</ENAMEX>, estimates the studio could lose $75 million or more on its motion-picture lineup in fiscal 1990. As for the coming schedule, she says ``they could have some hits and some misses,'' with such movies as ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Gringo</ENAMEX>,'' starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Fonda</ENAMEX>, and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Revenge</ENAMEX>,'' starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX>.
But Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Firestone</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> has made ``a convincing case'' that it will produce a hefty $300 million in cash flow in the 1990 fiscal year from its various businesses, and from selling movies into video, television and foreign markets. ``They have a growing backlog of production to sell into secondary and tertiary markets,'' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Firestone</ENAMEX>.
Wall Street and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> are much more impressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s television business. Like many studios, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> earns far more money from television than movies, but the discrepancy is even more stark at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. ``Movies lose money for Columbia most years,'' says a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> executive, ``and even in the so-called great years, the movie division has been a drain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Television</ENAMEX> is a real workhorse.''
Indeed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> would be acquiring one of the best track records around at getting popular sitcoms on the air, keeping them there and aggressively marketing their reruns. The studio also produces the top-rated soap opera on television, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Restless</ENAMEX>,'' and derives enormous profits from ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy,'' acquired with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merv Griffin</ENAMEX> Enterprises a few years ago. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> bought much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s success in television by acquiring companies like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merv Griffin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Lear</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embassy Communications</ENAMEX> over the last five years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comedy</ENAMEX> is king in prime time now, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s management was smart enough to shift the studio's emphasis to comedy and away from one-hour dramatic shows in recent years. Although some of the new prime-time series <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> has on the air look like good candidates for quick cancellation, ``The Famous <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Z</ENAMEX>'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> is already a big hit with critics. Counting its five returning series, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> is producing a total of 10 shows at once.
All together, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> has 23 sitcoms in syndication, of which nine are among the top 20 in national ratings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> says that only about 9% of series that get on the networks last long enough for reruns, but that its track record is more than 30%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s biggest syndication success is ``Who's the Boss?'' -- second only to ``The Cosby Show'' in fees paid by television stations. Counting all the stations carrying ``Boss,'' each episode will be sold for an estimated $2.5 million, bringing Columbia more than $250 million over four years. That's more than twice the syndication fee for popular, award-winning ``Cheers,'' according to industry estimates. Still, to succeed over the long term and minimize the risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> has to prove it can maintain a healthy market share at the box office and return the studio to the glory it boasted before the management turmoil of the past decade or so.
Company insiders note that despite its share of flops, the studio has produced and distributed such Academy Award winning films as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gandhi</ENAMEX>'' and ``The Last Emperor.'' And it has had its share of commercial hits in recent years, including ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ghostbusters</ENAMEX>,'' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karate Kid</ENAMEX>,'' ``Tootsie'' and ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Chill.</ENAMEX>``Those  movies continue to be valuable pieces of the library -- and are fodder for sequels and remakes.
If its bid succeeds, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is likely to keep the current team on board; the Japanese company has said it is interested in buying a studio with management in place. It bought both a company and a management team when it acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX>. There, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> kept on chief executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Yetnikoff</ENAMEX> and his hand-picked staff; while the record company has been struggling to regain lost market share this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> stays out of day-to-day involvement in the record business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaufman</ENAMEX> and other top executives would do rather nicely from a purchase of the company at the price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is offering. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaufman</ENAMEX>'s various stock and options plans could net him about $30 million in a sale of the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allen & Co.</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert A. Allen</ENAMEX> owns just over three million shares, worth more than $80 million at the price on the table.
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> shareholders, they too could benefit handsomely. Just a year ago, the stock was trading at $11 per share.
Still, analysts note that had Columbia been able to produce a steady stream of hits the way rivals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> did, the investment might have proven a far more profitable one for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> shareholders. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kagan</ENAMEX>, who runs media investment concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kagan Associates</ENAMEX>, notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> originally purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> seeking another stream of earnings; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> produced cash flow, but no steady profits.
``It was destined to change hands once that happened,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kagan</ENAMEX> says. ``Had they owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>, they wouldn't have had the same problem, of owning a company which didn't generate enough hits to justify being the entertainment subsidiary of an earnings-driven company.''
