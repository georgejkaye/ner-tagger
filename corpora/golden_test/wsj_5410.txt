Aldus Corp., Seattle, said it began shipping a modified version of its Aldus Pagemaker 3.0 desktop publishing program for Microsoft Corp.'s OS\ operating system software.
Aldus, a high-technology company whose earnings stalled in the second quarter because of excess inventory, said the program is the first to incorporate the OS\ software's advanced technology. Microsoft is trying to make OS\ the industry standard for operating systems software, which controls a computer's basic functions. The product has yet to catch on well with users, however.
Aldus had flat earnings of $3.4 million, or 26 cents a share, in the second quarter after a string of quarterly profit jumps. In the first quarter, for example, Aldus's net income was up 39% at $4.3 million, or 33 cents a share.
