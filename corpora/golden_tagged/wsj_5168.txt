A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> judge ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens-Illinois Inc.</ENAMEX> should be forced to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brockway Inc.</ENAMEX> unit because their combined share reduces competition in the glass-container market.
The decision prompted a brief but severe sell-off of high-yield bonds issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens-Illinois</ENAMEX>, which was taken private in a $3.64 billion leveraged buy-out in 1987 by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX>, the largest U.S. leveraged buy-out firm.
Some of the bonds fell three or four points before recovering most of those losses after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> said it plans to appeal the ruling, and wouldn't have to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brockway</ENAMEX> until 1993 or 1994 even if it loses the case. Some traders earlier had believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brockway</ENAMEX> might have to be sold much sooner, possibly at a loss.
The ruling by administrative law judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Timony</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens-Ilinois</ENAMEX>'s 1987 acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brockway</ENAMEX> for $750 million gave the combined companies 38% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> glass-container market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens</ENAMEX> contends the commission should instead consider its smaller share of the entire container market, including plastic and metal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens-Illinois</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toledo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, already has combined the two companies' operations, saving more than $50 million annually, according to a company spokesman.
But the specter of a forced asset sale frightened some traders in the junk-bond market. ``You've had a very jittery junk market and any kind of bad news sends people barreling off a cliff,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maeda Klein</ENAMEX>, a high-yield bond analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Owens-Illinois</ENAMEX> has about $3 billion of high-risk, high-yield bonds outstanding. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashok Vasvani</ENAMEX>, a bond analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, said the bonds regained all but one point of their losses by late in the afternoon. ``My own feeling is this is no problem at all,'' he said.
The company's bonds have underperformed the rest of the junk-bond market because container prices have fallen 8% during the past two years, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> said. For the first six months of 1989, the company reported revenue of $1.77 billion and earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation of $365 million. Its net interest expenses were $238 million in the same period.
