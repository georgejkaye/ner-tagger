High-definition television promises to be the TV of tomorrow, so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market. Although major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, not everyone here is ready to give up.
A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin, high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s. With only small help from the government, these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry, which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Photonics Technology Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northwood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planar Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beaverton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore.</ENAMEX>, the largest of these firms, with $20 million in annual revenue, has similar plans. It already has had success in electroluminescence, another promising technology adaptable for high-definition television.
Two other firms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Troy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnascreen Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays.
The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set. Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX>, which is expected to become a $30 billion business world-wide within a decade. Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment. But except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zenith Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>, which is collaborating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> on computer displays, they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson-CSF</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. ``We found the market not developing as we thought it would,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> spokesman says.
The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents, and because the prize is still there to be seized. ``No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels'' at commercial costs, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zvi Yaniv</ENAMEX>, the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ovonic Imaging.</ENAMEX> He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that.
The Bush administration, hearing conflicting advice about what its role in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> should be, isn't doing much for now. The only material support it is extending to the struggling U.S. industry is $30 million in awards from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</ENAMEX>. The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and other prospective competitors are spending. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $1 billion.
``Unless it gets more help, the U.S. industry won't have a chance,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Friedman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Photonics</ENAMEX>'s executive vice president.
Thus far, almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> laboratories. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Brody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Magnascreen</ENAMEX>'s president, says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use, just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording.
In the 1970s, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> helped develop the first display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ENAMEX>'s research labs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>. The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements, each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image.
In 1979, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> left the company to find other backers. He has a claim to the right to commercialize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> patents, but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers.
``Most American investors have just given up,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brody</ENAMEX> says. ``They aren't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter.''
Many critics question the industry's need for federal support; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> justifies its help on national-security grounds. ``We don't see a domestic source for some of our {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX>} requirements, and that's a source of concern,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kelly</ENAMEX>, director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARPA</ENAMEX>'s defense manufacturing office. So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARPA</ENAMEX> is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> already has some military applications, such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is ordering displays for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aegis</ENAMEX> cruisers and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> also is trying to encourage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDTV</ENAMEX> because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries. ``It isn't just yuppie television,'' argues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Clifford</ENAMEX>, director of the department's office of microelectronics and instrumentation. ``The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market.''
Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid, such as antitrust relief for research consortia, the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds. Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial.
They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce department</ENAMEX>'s concern over their future. They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX>, to exempt portable color Tvs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> imposes on the larger Japanese color Tvs.
And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planar</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hurd</ENAMEX> says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15% to sell his display panels in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>, while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty-free.
``This isn't a technology issue, but an attitude issue,'' he says. ``We just haven't learned what it takes to compete.
