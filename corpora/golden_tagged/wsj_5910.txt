Brand names are hard to beat. But that doesn't stop some upstarts from trying. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> took on the venerable UPS with a vengeance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> boldly challenged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Shuttle</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX> is going up against Crest toothpaste. And eventually some U.S. manufacturer is going to challenge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> Trinitron legend with claims of a sharper picture tube.
What are some of the secrets of tackling a product that has strong brand loyalty -- or recapturing it if your customers are being stolen away? One landmark case has distilled the tempest in a cordial glass as the world's two leading makers of the liqueur sambuca contend for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market. In a surprise attack, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molinari</ENAMEX> -- the leader in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> but little known here -- startled predominant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sambuca Romana</ENAMEX> by doubling U.S. sales with an approach that ended up looking like a political campaign. As a first step, posters were placed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> subways and, though not targeting a minority, all were in Italian.
An attention-grabbing marketing campaign was just part of the picture. When it comes to breaking entrenched brand loyalty, a total marketing-communications approach is required.
With this in mind, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molinari</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MG & Messina Advertising</ENAMEX>, positioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molinari</ENAMEX> to take advantage of a 200% increase in all Italian product sales in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> (from $5.8 billion in 1983 to $11.7 billion in 1987). Buyers of high-quality Italian items were becoming sophisticated enough to choose, for example, between brands of olive oil. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MG & Messina</ENAMEX>'s public-relations consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Agins</ENAMEX> recalls that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molinari</ENAMEX> sought to ride the tide by creating a ``best brand'' image. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agins</ENAMEX> adds: ``It's crucial that an image is backed by quality convincingly demonstrated.'' To this end Molinari claimed that only its sambuca was designated ``Extra'' by an Italian judge for its ``superior ingredients.''
But what has solidified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molinari</ENAMEX>'s position is its competitor's failure to respond and blunt the challenge. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romana</ENAMEX> continued advertising the myth of improving one's luck by placing coffee beans in a glass of sambuca (something that did not distinguish <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romana</ENAMEX> from its competitor).
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agile Molinari</ENAMEX> swiftly struck again with aggressive headlines: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molinari</ENAMEX> doesn't need a myth to be appreciated''; ``Instead of quality, they offer coffee beans''; and, ``If you can appreciate the difference between a myth and a tradition....''
Despite mounting evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molinari</ENAMEX>'s success (although it doesn't offer specifics on the number of cases sold), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romana</ENAMEX> doesn't appear eager to counterattack. ``We have no plans to change anything,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Foglio</ENAMEX>, vice president and general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Furze Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Romana</ENAMEX>'s importers. ``We built the category and will continue to be the leader.''
In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX>'s managers recommend the opposite approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX>'s marketing vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Glenn</ENAMEX>, says: ``We built the overnight category, but we are absolutely not going to rest on laurels. We act on the assumption that competitors are going to be successful in everything.''
Since its start-up in 1973, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> has recognized that success is built upon the same rule as in the sambuca case: Image comes first.
This same thinking applies to marketshare won by exploiting a new technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> improved overnight service with an innovation that permitted instant package-tracing. Instead of relegating the system only to internal use, they made the tracking information immediately available to customers. This was largely responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX>'s rapid rise (today a 30%-plus share, with sales of $4.6 billion, compared with powerhouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX>'s 15%). Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn</ENAMEX> says, ``Status of package proved as important as a delivery itself, because it gives customers a feeling of control.''
PR-wise managers fed positive information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX>'s package tracing to the media, which praised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX>'s abilities, thereby further solidifying customer loyalty. Meanwhile UPS, the industry leader in private package delivery, elected to maintain its long-successful, low-profile image. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> thus grew virtually unchallenged for more than a decade.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> management now recognizes the importance of a greater emphasis on public relations to mount a counteroffensive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> marketing manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Pyne</ENAMEX> says: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX> is 80 years old. But yesterday's brand loyalty is not enough.'' After listening more closely to customers to discover how to improve its service, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UPS</ENAMEX>'s goal is to become the category's technology leader. In other words, it is borrowing from its competitor.
In a bellwether for major market-share battles to come, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate-Palmolive</ENAMEX> is challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> -- the company that wrote the book on capturing brand loyalty -- as it moves within striking distance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>'s number-one U.S. position in the billion-dollar toothpaste business. In three years <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX> has come from 50% behind to within 12%, or six share points, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>'s Crest.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX> management is highly media responsive. But falling into the same trap we have seen elsewhere, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> management remains reclusive. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Dobson</ENAMEX>, the company strives to remain constant with policies effective since 1961.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Meyer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX>'s U.S. oral-care division general manager, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crest</ENAMEX>'s market share based on brand loyalty won't survive. And, in multipronged attacks -- which portray <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX> as a ``Wise Choice'' and level salvos of complaints against Crest that were filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Dental Association</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX> is eroding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> claims. Most recently it forced suspension of a major campaign touting the fluoride superiority of Crest. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colgate</ENAMEX> says it is equal in endorsements, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> won't have the slogan ``the dentists' choice'' much longer.
The Crest-Colgate battle emphasizes the elements that are particularly important in a tight race for brand loyalty: 1) swift management response both to media and to the marketplace; 2) ability to create a perception of quality; 3) maximized spending. This new concept of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Megamarketing</ENAMEX>,'' applied to a quality product at a fair price, makes capturing brand loyalty not a mystery, but a challenge.
