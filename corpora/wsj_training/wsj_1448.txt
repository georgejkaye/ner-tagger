This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week's earthquake.
Estimates of damage in the six-county <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area neared $5 billion, excluding the cost of repairing the region's transportation system.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Bridge</ENAMEX>, the main artery into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> from the east, will be closed for at least several weeks. Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale. The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day. Also, most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south, the 101 freeway, have been closed for repairs.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> Rapid Transit system, which runs subway trains beneath the bay, is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BART</ENAMEX> has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught.
Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bay</ENAMEX> towns of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX>. For the first time in 32 years, ferry service has been restored between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red and White Fleet</ENAMEX>, which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marin County</ENAMEX>, and tourist tours of the bay, is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $10 round-trip.
That tariff is too stiff for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial District</ENAMEX> wage earners. ``I'll stay with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BART</ENAMEX>,'' said one secretary, swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube.
Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bay</ENAMEX> residents making a long detour. ``We're anticipating quite a traffic crunch,'' said one official. About 23,000 people typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours. About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period.
Meetings canceled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX>'s European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants. It also raised hackles of the city's tourism boosters. ``Other cities are calling {groups booked here for tours and conferences} and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Shafer</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Agnos</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX> officials stuck by their estimate of $2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city. The other five Bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $2.8 billion. All estimates exclude highway repair, which could exceed $1 billion.
Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage.
The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Embarcadero Freeway</ENAMEX>. Until it was closed Tuesday, it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial District</ENAMEX>. Engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the Embarcadero structure.
As part of the quake recovery effort, the city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Building Department</ENAMEX> has surveyed about 3,000 buildings, including all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial District</ENAMEX>'s high-rises.
The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that ``we were incredibly lucky,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Kornfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s chief building inspector. While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage, little of that involved major structural damage. City building codes require construction that can resist temblors.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Leach</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, said the insurance market hasn't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster. ``The extent of the claims won't be known for some time,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leach</ENAMEX> said.
On Friday, during a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> to survey quake damage, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> promised to ``meet the federal government's obligation'' to assist relief efforts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California</ENAMEX> officials plan to  ask <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> for $3 billion or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low-interest loans. The state has a $1 billion reserve, and is expected to add $1 billion to that fund in the next year. Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid, but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief. However, state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum.
