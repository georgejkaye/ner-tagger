<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bass PLC</ENAMEX> said that its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coral</ENAMEX> Racing subsidiary purchased 369 betting shops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> from Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX>, another major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> leisure and brewing company.
Terms of the cash purchase weren't disclosed, but it is part of Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan</ENAMEX>'s previously announced decision to dispose of its betting operations.
Coral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racing</ENAMEX>, which operates 1,008 betting shops in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>, will take title to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> properties on Friday, which marks the start of the new fiscal year for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grand Met</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coral</ENAMEX> Racing said.
Grand Met also sold 45 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hill</ENAMEX> shops in central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> earlier Friday to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladbroke Group PLC</ENAMEX> for # 26 million ($41 million).
Grand Met bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hill</ENAMEX> betting shops from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears PLC</ENAMEX> last December for # 331 million but the U.K. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monopolies and Mergers Commission</ENAMEX> ruled two weeks ago that a ``small number'' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hill</ENAMEX> shops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> should be sold to prevent Grand Met from attaining ``undue market power on an industrywide basis.
