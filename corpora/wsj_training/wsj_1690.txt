<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> drug-policy director, accused local officials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers.
``Politics has essentially put up a roadblock'' to finding sites for new federal prisons, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> said at a news conference called to report on his ``emergency assistance program'' for the capital. Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals, he added, ``we will not win the war on drugs.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> declared in April that he would make Washington a ``test case'' for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence. The drug czar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here, ``albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like.''
He acknowledged, however, that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s ``drug-related murder rate is intolerably high. The prisons are too crowded. Drugs continue to be sold openly around schools, parks and housing projects.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s problem. But other <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials have criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Schaefer</ENAMEX> for blocking the use of possible sites in that state. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> officials also have said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion Barry</ENAMEX> has delayed consideration of sites in the city.
In a letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s office, released yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s city administrator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Thompson</ENAMEX>, complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital. Referring to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s claim that the federal government would provide $97 million in emergency federal support, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> wrote, ``Our analysis was unable to even come close to documenting that figure.''
Of his successes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates. He also noted that the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than $2 million in seizures of drug dealers' assets. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> has lent the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Investigation</ENAMEX> has provided crime laboratory facilities and training, he added.
