After several years of booming business with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade.
The imposition of austerity measures, starting last October, already had begun to pinch when the massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX> on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter. Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then, choking liquidity and hobbling many projects. And <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies, leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Givaudan Far East Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, typifies the problems. Last year's retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories. The company's sales flattened during 1989's first half.
The June killings magnified the problems. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Givaudan</ENAMEX>'s representative office received no orders in June. At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions, but when no orders were logged in August and September, manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Lai</ENAMEX> became convinced that business would be bad for many months.
``Things have grown worse since June 4,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lai</ENAMEX> says. He predicts that sales will drop between 30% and 40% from last year's $3 million.
The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s austerity measures, and foreign companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Givaudan</ENAMEX> that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest. But in general, all foreign-trading companies are feeling the pinch.
``The import pie will shrink,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kamm</ENAMEX>, first vice president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> trade specialist. ``On the down side, sales could fall as much as 90% for some companies; on the upper side, sales will be flat.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade. The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange. The current trough is expected to be much deeper, because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation. In addition, the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback.
``The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Wong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mannesmann AG</ENAMEX>, a West German machinery-trading company.
Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16% in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and 7.1% in August, compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half. In the first eight months of 1989, imports grew 21%, to $38.32 billion, down slightly from a growth rate of 23% a year earlier.
The picture for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s exports is just as bleak, mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze. Exports in the first eight months grew only 9%, to $31.48 billion, compared with a growth rate of 25% a year earlier, according to Chinese customs figures.
The threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves, excluding gold holdings. The reserves dropped for the first time in recent years, to $14 billion in June from $19 billion in April.
The trend has prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> to intensify efforts to curb imports. In recent weeks, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade</ENAMEX> set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping China export. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissho Iwai Corp.</ENAMEX>, one of the biggest Japanese trading houses, now buys almost twice as many goods from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> as it sells to that country. Three years ago, the ratio was reversed.
But the strategy isn't helping much this time. ``Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masahiko Kitamura</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissho Iwai</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canton</ENAMEX> office. He expects the company's trading business to drop as much as 40% this year.
For a short time after June 4, it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright. Many foreign trading offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties. Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, which normally took weeks to process letters of credit, was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank's financial health.
But when foreign traders tried to do business, they discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen. The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s national trading companies, which are among the country's biggest importers.
Business isn't any better on the provincial or municipal level, foreign traders say. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shanghai Investment & Trust Co.</ENAMEX>, known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sitco</ENAMEX>, is the city's main financier for trading business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sitco</ENAMEX> had customarily tapped the Japanese bond market for funds, but it can't do that any longer. Foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash.
``It has difficulties paying its foreign debts,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> executive who is familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sitco</ENAMEX>'s business. ``How can it make available funds for purchases?''
Foreign traders also say many of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Lee</ENAMEX>, a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales, estimates that as many as 70% of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months. ``There are virtually no new projects, and that means no new business for us,'' he says.
Even when new lending resumes, foreign exchange would still be tight because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing, which has grown between 30% and 40% in the past few years. And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years.
Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel, chemical fertilizers and plastics. These have been among the country's leading imports, particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly.
But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices. To stem speculation, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year. Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling don't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock. The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> can't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country's export business. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kamm</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> trade expert, estimates that as much as 50% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangdong</ENAMEX>'s exports is made up of processed imported raw materials.
