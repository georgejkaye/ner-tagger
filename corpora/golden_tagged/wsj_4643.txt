Some executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A.</ENAMEX> Gear have been cashing in on the company's soaring success -- while retaining substantial stakes in its future performance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Y. Greenberg</ENAMEX>, chairman, got $6.2 million in early August for selling only 7% of his stock in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based sportswear and athletic footwear manufacturer, filings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> show. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Williams</ENAMEX>, an executive vice president, received $3.1 million for selling 22% of his shares, according to the filings.
Both sales were part of a public offering of 1.2 million shares, a spokesman for the company said. Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> could be reached for comment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> retains 1.8 million shares, while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> still holds 280,000, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings.
Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A. Gear</ENAMEX> shares hit a 52-week high (adjusted for a recent stock split), closing at $41.50 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading. That was up $3.25 from the previous close.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.A. Gear</ENAMEX> has had a slew of good news recently. The company split its stock 2-for-1, predicted sales for September would hit a record, and signed on pop superstar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> as its spokesman.
The announcement of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>'s involvement with the company, and recent strong orders for L.A. Gear goods at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Sporting Goods Show</ENAMEX>, ``are creating a lot of momentum'' in the stock, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heidi Steinberg</ENAMEX>. She added that some arbitragers held short positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">L.A.</ENAMEX> Gear shares, and the rise yesterday could be in part from covering of those positions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> is recommending purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A. Gear</ENAMEX> shares, and is expecting them to outperform the market as a whole, she said.
Speaking at a conference for securities analysts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earlier this month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenberg</ENAMEX> said the deal with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> ``literally stunned most retailers, which is good news because when they're stunned you can sell them anything.'' Sales are already up on the news, he said.
HEALTHY BUYING: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Crean</ENAMEX>, president of the industry group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO & Co.</ENAMEX>, has more than doubled his stake in the hospital information company. Early in August, he bought 34,000 shares for about $340,050, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crean</ENAMEX> is the third HBO insider to buy shares this year, bucking a trend of insider-selling at other companies in the software and medical sectors.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crean</ENAMEX> said he had been bullish on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> stock for some time, because ``the company's been on a turnaround'' and the stock, which had fallen as low as $6, ``has gotten going again.'' But he didn't buy his recent stake until he won $2 million in a lawsuit against a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> brokerage firm that he charged mismanaged his options account.
In the earlier transactions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gerdes</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer of the firm's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Systems Support Inc.</ENAMEX> unit, purchased 7,000 HBO shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">April</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. Holcombe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX>, a member of the board, purchased 35,000 shares, also more than doubling his stake, in several purchases in April. Neither could be reached for comment.
On the over-the-counter market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> shares rose 12.5 cents to $12.50.
COMPUTER SALE: At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX>, the president of its international division, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eckhard A. Pfeiffer</ENAMEX>, sold two-thirds of his stake in the company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings show. He sold 50,000 shares, for $4.7 million, or an average price of about $94 a share, according to the filings. Both the company and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfeiffer</ENAMEX> declined to comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> shares finished at $89.125, down 62.5 cents, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
