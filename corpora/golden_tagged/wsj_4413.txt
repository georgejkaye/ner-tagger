Major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and Japanese concerns, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Estate Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JMB Realty Co.</ENAMEX>, have voiced interest in acquiring a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, according to individuals familiar with the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> sale.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Cushman III</ENAMEX>, the flamboyant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> real-estate developer and broker, said he, too, would like to be part of a group investing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX>, a private holding company owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> family trusts. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cushman</ENAMEX>, who has extensive connections with Japanese real-estate investors, said he is trying to put together a transaction with a domestic company and a foreign investment group, which he wouldn't name.
Earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX> said it will pursue a recapitalization plan. Sources say the company's decision to offer between about 48% and 80% of the company to outside investors is intended to raise an estimated $1 billion to $1.3 billion for the family.
The company's real-estate holdings include the landmark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, which it also manages. In addition, it operates a real-estate development company, an entertainment unit, a telecommunications business and a financial-services division. It holds about 80% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cushman & Wakefield</ENAMEX>, a national real-estate services concern based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cushman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> broker, is a descendent of founders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cushman & Wakefield Inc.</ENAMEX>, where he worked for about 15 years. He left the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> brokerage concern in the late 1970s after unsuccessful attempts to take it over. ``I've known the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> family for years and have great respect for them. They are aware of my interest,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard A. Voell</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX>, said, ``We've received scores of calls from investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.'' He said the response came following a report in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> earlier this month describing the company's plans to raise cash. He wouldn't comment on names of interested parties.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Voell</ENAMEX> and his financial advisers stressed that when a ``fact book'' on the transaction is completed -- sometime in the next several weeks -- it will be offered to only a limited, pre-selected group of potential investors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX>'s board has retained the investment banking firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> to consider alternatives for providing a debt or equity infusion into the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> is the investment banker for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller</ENAMEX> family trustees.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Mikulich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> managing director, said he wouldn't confirm or deny interest by such companies as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Life</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, one of the world's largest institutional investors; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Estate</ENAMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> developer and international property owner; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JMB</ENAMEX>, a diversified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> real-estate concern based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikulich</ENAMEX> said he has received inquiries from individuals and corporations seeking a stake in the entire company as well as just certain assets. He added that while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> is scrutinizing many alternatives, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockefeller Group</ENAMEX>'s primary objective is to offer a stake in the entire company.
