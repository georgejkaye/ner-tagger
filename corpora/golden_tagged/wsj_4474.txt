The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX>, as expected, unveiled a new computerized order-entry device for floor traders.
The hand-held computer, developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IGS Information Services Inc.</ENAMEX> unit, would provide ``tamper-proof'' time stamping of trades and improve the exchange's audit trail, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comex</ENAMEX> officials said. The system will be tested on the trading floor by the first quarter of 1990.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comex</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Staloff</ENAMEX> said the exchange has been looking into electronic order-entry systems for four years, and was eager to introduce it ``in light of what's going on in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and at the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX>).''
Pressure has been building for tighter trade reporting in the futures industry in the wake of the federal investigations into trading abuses at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> exchanges. In August, the two big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> futures exchanges announced the development of their own electronic order-entry system. Their system isn't expected to be up and running for at least a year.
The new Comex system, which will cost $200,000 to develop, will ``make detection of misconduct easier,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Fink</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comex</ENAMEX> chairman. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fink</ENAMEX> said floor traders, who will bear the burden of this new system, will be ``nervous about it,'' until they get used to using it.
Traders would have to carry the small computer and the battery pack during the trading session and enter each trade upon execution. The system will initially operate using diskettes that will be periodically collected during the trading session.
