<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi</ENAMEX> is in the midst of trying to sell off most of its consulting business, but some securities analysts say the sales price may well fall below the company's initial expectations.
In June, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> first announced its plans to sell the consulting business, it told analysts the sale should bring in # 250 million to # 350 million ($392.5 million to $549.5 million). But analysts have said the figure will be much closer to the lower end of the spectrum, and now some have cut their estimates, saying it's even possible the figure could go below # 250 million.
Meanwhile, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> hoped to find a single buyer for its various consulting operations, it hasn't had any luck and now must sell the business piecemeal. Some analysts are also getting edgy because the company indicated that it might announce some sales by the end of its fiscal year, Sept. 30, a goal which now seems unlikely to be met.
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> continues to say it will announce the bulk of the sales by the end of the calendar year. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Schwarzman</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s investment bank, pointed out that the offering memorandums weren't even mailed out to prospective buyers until early August, and ``it's unrealistic to expect completed deals within five weeks.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwarzman</ENAMEX> said there are ``a large number of potential purchasers for various units.'' A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> spokesman added, ``Under no circumstances do we feel compelled to sell these companies. If we don't get the right price, we won't sell.''
``Are they not being disappointed a little prematurely? It's only September,'' the spokesman said. ``We're looking to the end of the calendar year to be able to announce these deals, and I don't think we are far away from that.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> paid about # 250 million to acquire its stable of consulting firms, and most analysts interviewed believe it will make that money back, and perhaps a bit more. Yet several aren't as optimistic about the price as they were just a few months ago.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Wallach</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> analyst, recently slashed his estimate of the sale proceeds to # 275 million from his previous estimate of # 325 million and said he now is looking at a range of # 225 million to # 300 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Sturgess</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based Barclay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Zoete Wedd</ENAMEX> also slightly lowered his expectations, from as high as # 270 million to ``# 250 million max.''
``The nearer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> gets to December, the less likely they are to get a good price,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sturgess</ENAMEX> said. ``A potential buyer knows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> has to sell {the consulting businesses} separately and knows he can put pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> on price. A desperate seller never gets the best price.''
Another hitch, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallach</ENAMEX>, is the recent weakness of the junk bond market, which in turn is cooling the market for any sort of leveraged acquisition. ``People are reassessing the transaction values'' for all kinds of acquisitions, he said.
So far, the analysts' changing estimates haven't affected their 1989 and 1990 earnings forecasts. But both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Dougherty</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Natwest Securities</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma Hill</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim & Co.</ENAMEX>, said that if the sales are delayed too long, it will cut into 1990 estimates. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dougherty</ENAMEX> currently is looking for 1990 pretax earnings of # 82 million, or 18 pence a share, including # 7 million of interest income on the proceeds of the sale. That estimate assumes, however, ``that the business would have been sold fairly early in the year'' for net proceeds of # 265 million, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment on which companies are interested in its various consulting units. But industry executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marsh & Mclennan</ENAMEX> has expressed interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Consulting</ENAMEX> unit, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcgraw-Hill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Proudfoot</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dun & Bradstreet</ENAMEX> have made some inquiries. Those firms either couldn't be reached or declined to comment. One executive familiar with the situation said a price is on the table for one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s consulting companies, and discussions are getting close on two others.
Several of the consulting firms, meanwhile, are trying to put together management buy-outs, people familiar with the discussions said. They said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s largest consulting unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hay Group</ENAMEX>, was attracting less interest than some of the smaller companies because of its size and some financial problems at the unit. Hay is one of the companies that may end up in a management buy-out, the people said.
Another firm trying to put together a buy-out is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gartner Group</ENAMEX>, a computer consulting firm, said executives close to the situation. But they said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gartner</ENAMEX> management would offer less than the approximately $85 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> paid for the consultant, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> hopes to command a premium for the firm, which has attracted a fair amount of interest. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peterson & Co.</ENAMEX> can't be sold without the approval of its principals and could end up remaining a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> unit, the executives said. Officials of the consulting firms either declined to comment or couldn't be reached.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.P. Morgan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Guaranty Trust</ENAMEX>, began the search for an ad agency when its former shop, the now-defunct <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doyle Graf Raj</ENAMEX>, crumbled in June. Most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doyle Graf</ENAMEX>'s other clients, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Swissair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kobrand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Haagen-Dazs</ENAMEX>, have already reassigned their accounts to new agencies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi</ENAMEX>, will develop campaigns for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.P. Morgan</ENAMEX>'s corporate and product advertising and its private banking business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> saw many agencies before narrowing the competition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> and two other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> shops, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina Mcnamee WCRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBWA Advertising</ENAMEX>.

INVESTIGATION: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meineke</ENAMEX> Discount Muffler <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shops</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, has pulled TV ads in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> area touting its low prices after the city's department of consumer affairs informed Meineke of its intent to file suit for deceptive advertising. A spokesman for the agency said it visited 20 Meineke shops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and found that none of them fixed mufflers on city vehicles for the prices advertised (''$18.93 to $26.95''). The average price, the department said, was $99.21. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David J. Kaufmann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meineke</ENAMEX>'s outside counsel, said the company stands by its ad slogan. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meineke</ENAMEX> has admitted no guilt, he said, adding the agency has refused to show the company its data. ``I don't believe their numbers,'' he said. No suit has been filed, and the two sides are expected to discuss the charges in the near future.
NEW AGENCY: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy Carlson</ENAMEX>, who resigned as executive vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells, Rich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greene</ENAMEX> on Monday, opened a new agency called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carlson & Partners</ENAMEX> to service the $10 million Polo/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX> account. Polo/<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lauren</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> client for the past three years, left the agency Friday.
