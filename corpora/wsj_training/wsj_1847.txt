Many in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> say President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs. We have a better idea: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dismantle HUD</ENAMEX> to pay for the war on drugs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Development</ENAMEX>'s budget is $17 billion. From what we and the nation have been reading, the money isn't being spent very well. The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods. If that takes money, take it away from this discredited federal department.
But of course the Democrats pillorying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind. Instead, they're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal.
This month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. No doubt many of his ideas are worthy, but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is unlikely to go even that far.
Last week, Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> members. They were appalled, for instance, that he wanted to target more of the $3 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Development</ENAMEX> Block Grant (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CDBG</ENAMEX>) program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious ``discretionary'' funds that have allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials to steer contracts to political cronies.
These development grants mainly enrich developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking garages. They also give those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> political credit for bringing home the pork, and so they are popular with such Members as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Rose Oakar</ENAMEX>.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakar</ENAMEX>, a Democrat from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, wants a $6.9 million grant so <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fame</ENAMEX>. She says it'd create 600 jobs and bring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> tourist revenue. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> says the project doesn't qualify, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> says that rock'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money.
At the hearing, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oakar</ENAMEX> started wailing about ``phoney baloney regulations'' that would stand between her and ``housing for downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>.'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chalmers Wylie</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> Republican, rallied to the cause: ``I think the gentlelady is making an important statement. The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there's something wrong, I think is most unfortunate.''
We're sure some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. Our view is that given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s attitude toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>, the place probably is beyond reform.
For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities. In the process <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> has wasted untold billions, created slums and invited corruption.
Much of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class. That includes the CDBG funds and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Housing Administration</ENAMEX>, which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be $4 billion in the hole. Selling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHA</ENAMEX>'s loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses.
Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor, and zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units. The rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods.
Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones. Even suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince George</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>, reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year, most of them drug-related. Innocent bystanders often are the victims. A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> drug battle. A three-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer.
Decent life in the inner cities won't be restored unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs. Until then, the billions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted.
It's still unclear whether Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> wants to completely overhaul the engine room at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> or just tighten a few screws here and there. No doubt he believes the place can be salvaged. Having seen the hypocrisy with which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has addressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals, we disagree. It's time to scrap the politically infested spending machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> has become and channel the resources into the drug war.
