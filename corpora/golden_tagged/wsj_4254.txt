Stock speculator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Boesky</ENAMEX> secretly tape-recorded three conversations with indicted junk-bond financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX> in 1986 shortly before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> was publicly named as a government informant, court documents indicate.
The nature of the discussions wasn't disclosed and prosecutors and defense lawyers declined to discuss their content. But the tapes could emerge as critical evidence in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>'s scheduled March 1990 trial on fraud and racketeering charges.
The tape recordings, made on Oct. 1, Oct. 9 and Nov. 6, 1986, were mentioned in a letter from the government to lawyers representing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>. The letter was attached to a recent filing in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
The final recorded conversation occurred just eight days before the disclosure that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> made a deal to cooperate with prosecutors in their investigation of Wall Street corruption.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>, the former head of junk-bond operations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>, was indicted in March on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boesky</ENAMEX> in November 1986 agreed to plead guilty to one criminal count of filing false information with the government and is serving a three-year jail term.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Liman</ENAMEX>, an attorney for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milken</ENAMEX>, said in a statement: ``As we've said in the past, we will not try this case in the press, and we look forward to a full hearing in court.
