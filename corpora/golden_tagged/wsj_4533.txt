The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Department of Insurance</ENAMEX> determined Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s hostile # 13.35 billion ($21.14 billion) takeover bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> isn't exempt from review by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> regulators.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> had been seeking an exemption from the regulatory review in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> and eight other states where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> insurance unit has operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> has also filed federal lawsuits in the nine states seeking to block the reviews.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> has claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> is ``primarily engaged in business other than the business of insurance,'' and that a review by the state insurance regulators, therefore, is uncalled for.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>'s attorneys said yesterday that while they believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> insurance regulators lack the legal authority to review the bid, they are confident that the offer will ultimately be approved by the regulators.
The blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> comes one day after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> proposed a restructuring to thwart the unwanted takeover attempts.
