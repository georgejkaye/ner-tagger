The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banco Ambrosiano</ENAMEX> was reignited by the arrest last week of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flavio Carboni</ENAMEX> on fraud charges.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> magistrates accuse Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carboni</ENAMEX> and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire ($880,000) from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Calvi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ambrosiano</ENAMEX> chairman found hanged under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackfriar</ENAMEX>'s Bridge shortly before the bank's collapse.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banco Ambrosiano</ENAMEX>, which was <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s largest private-sector bank, collapsed in 1982 with $1.3 billion of debts. Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX> that were owned, directly or indirectly, by the Vatican bank. The Vatican, which denies any wrongdoing, paid $250 million to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan</ENAMEX> bank's creditors as a ``goodwill gesture'' in 1985.
Italian news reports said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carboni</ENAMEX> and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a Vatican official, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pavel Hnilica</ENAMEX>. Italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the Vatican bank from blame in the scandal, or showing that the bank, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istituto</ENAMEX> per le <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opere di Religione</ENAMEX>, channeled funds to East bloc groups such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>.
Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hnilica</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carboni</ENAMEX> nor Vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend.
