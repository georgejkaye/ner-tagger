Quick  Name the most protectionist president since World War II.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorry</ENAMEX>, time's up. The answer: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>.
It's sad but true. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> talked a good free-trade game. But it was mostly talk.
During Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s two-term presidency, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> embraced or increased protection against a whole range of imports -- including steel, automobiles, sugar, semiconductors, lumber and machine tools. Subsidies for U.S. agriculture -- which tend to give domestic produce unfair advantages over foreign farmers -- also reached new heights in the Reagan years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occasionally</ENAMEX> -- but only occasionally -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s cabinet officers would take note of the administration's clandestine romance with protectionism. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> ``has granted more import relief to U.S. industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Baker</ENAMEX> said in a little-noticed speech at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for International Economics</ENAMEX> here on Sept. 14, 1987.
Yet most of the Reagan administration's speeches on international commerce read like a free-trade manifesto. ``I don't think there was ever a president where the gap between the rhetoric and the reality {on trade} was greater'' than with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hormats</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>'s international unit who served in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administrations.
Such a gap, however, makes recent U.S. attacks on foreign trade barriers look particularly hypocritical to allies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. And it helps explain why President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> now is having to scramble to restore the nation's free-trade credentials by promising to cut back steel quotas and stressing his desire to ``open markets and expand trade.''
To be sure, there are many who defend the Reagan record on trade. Their main argument: The move toward protectionism in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> could have been much worse, particularly given a vocal and protectionist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. ``What other country would have taken such a swing in its trade account without resorting to wholesale protectionism?'' asks a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration official. Or, as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hormats</ENAMEX> puts it: ``The more charitable way of looking at it is that given the enormity of the trade deficit and the depth of the recession, we were remarkably restrained.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, for his part, justified the Reagan administration's policies in his September 1987 speech as being part of the president's commitment to ``fair trade.'' Such protection, he said, was necessary to combat subsidized imports and trade barriers abroad. ``Without fair trade,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said, ``public support for free trade would surely collapse.''
But Reagan officials clearly deserve some of the blame as well. Until Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> took over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> in 1985, the Reagan administration refused to try to slow the soaring dollar. That, in turn, helped stimulate a huge and continuing import boom, ravaging many of the nation's industries and increasing the clamor for trade barriers.
``The Reagan administration talked a wonderful free-trade game, but their macroeconomic policy made it impossible to carry out a free-trade policy,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Fred Bergsten</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for International Economics</ENAMEX> and a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> official in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> administration. ``By avoiding government intervention on the foreign-exchange market, they forced themselves into a situation where they had to go protectionist.''
And may still have to. Despite Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s recent reaffirmation of the country's commitment to free trade, that pledge may only be as good as the latest trade-deficit numbers. ``If the trade deficit starts up again,'' warns Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsten</ENAMEX>, ``the {present} approach to bringing down the trade deficit will get discredited,'' and there will be calls for more protectionism.
