<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> called on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX> to lower interest rates.
In a speech to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mortgage Bankers Association</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> broke the administration's public silence on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> and complained that ``interest rates are too high.''
``I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4% or 5% would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts, the housing stock, our industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, the refurbishing of our industrial system, it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> recently eased credit by lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 3/4% from about 9%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials say inflation is under control. With economic growth slowing, they say they believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> should ease credit even further. But for the most part, officials have avoided expressing those views in public, fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
