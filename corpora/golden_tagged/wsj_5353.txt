Last week, small-business owners popped champagne corks when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> announced he would finally support repeal of Section 89. That now-notorious measure would force companies to prove they don't discriminate in the employee benefits they offer executives and lower-paid workers. Business groups unanimously condemned the soupy language of Section 89 as so burdensome and costly that some employers were preparing to drop all fringe benefits. Alas, these folks had better try to recork the bubbly.
In backing repeal, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> casually added that he would substitute ``certain nondiscrimination rules'' -- which he did not define -- that would apply only to health benefits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> passed the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> rules last week as part of the capital-gains tax package, but so far the legislative language hasn't been made public. A source who has seen it calls it Son of Section 89, and says that in some areas -- such as the obligation to notify workers of benefits -- the new law is more onerous than the original.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> won't release the language of the new rules -- which will be added to Section 106-b of the tax code -- and is waffling on what actually constitutes repeal. A committee spokesman says, ``It is virtual repeal. It is not total repeal.'' When they talk that way in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, it's time to check your wallet.
Section 89's history is as dubious and murky as any of the 1,000-page ``continuing resolutions'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is fond of passing in the wee hours. No bill embodying Section 89 was ever filed, nor will any Member admit parentage. It was by many accounts the brainchild of two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> staffers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent Mason</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Conaway</ENAMEX>, who dropped it into the 1986 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Reform</ENAMEX> Act during a closed committee session. Democratic Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lafalce</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Committee</ENAMEX>, says, ``I have not talked to any Member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> who says he understood what Section 89 was all about, or even that there was a Section 89.'' It's little wonder that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> staffers sometimes say they have the power of Members without the accountability.
Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mason</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conaway</ENAMEX> have since followed the timeworn career path of many former congressional staffers. Both men are now employed by firms where their duties include consulting on and interpreting for clients the Section 89 provisions they ushered into the tax code. Another consulting group is even marketing a $5,500-a-copy Section 89 software program, which they say is ``reviewed/designed,'' as well as endorsed and recommended by ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kent Mason</ENAMEX>, who wrote Section 89.''
Today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Rules Committee</ENAMEX> will vote on a proposal to allow a simple vote to repeal Section 89 onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> floor. You'd think that since 75% of all House Members, including a majority of Democrats, support repeal that a vote will be allowed. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rules Committee</ENAMEX> plays by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Rules, which means anything the leadership wants usually happens.
The Section 89 affair embodies all that is wrong with the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Written by staffers and passed by largely unsuspecting Members in the dead of night, its repeal has been kept on hold by a combination of sleight of hand and sheer parliamentary muscle. The battle over Section 89 is really a battle over whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can be forced to represent the people instead of its own peculiar interests.
