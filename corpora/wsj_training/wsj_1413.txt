President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to raise to $6 billion from $3 billion the amount of money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> may shift among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s individual programs, projects and activities, allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict.
If the request is approved by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> would need only permission from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> to move the money, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> budget analysts.
That would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> flexibility that no other federal agency has. ``It's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs,'' said Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Budget Committee</ENAMEX>, who said he would oppose the request. ``That isn't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose,'' he said.
The president's request didn't indicate how Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> would shift the money. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> official said the request was made to give the department ``maximum flexibility'' to deal with the cuts.
Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> structured the $16.1 billion spending reduction, half of which must come from defense, to ``impose a little bit more discipline'' by applying cuts to each individual program, project or activity in the budget. That would give agencies ``less ability... to fudge over things,'' he told reporters.
Under the deficit-reduction law, 4.3% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s money and 5.3% of other agencies' money has been canceled. Lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit-cutting measure has been signed into law.
