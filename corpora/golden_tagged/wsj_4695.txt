<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s gross national product, or the total output of goods and services, contracted 0.8% in the April-June quarter from the previous three months, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Planning Agency</ENAMEX>.
The contraction was mainly because of a drop in personal spending in reaction to a surge ahead of the introduction of a 3% consumption tax in April.
But private-sector and government economists say the economy maintains its momentum after overcoming the deflationary impact of the yen's sharp rise.
The agency report said personal consumption, a key to economic growth accounting for nearly 60% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX>, was generally strong despite a drop in household spending in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
