Shareholders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> overwhelmingly approved, as expected, a resolution to register the bank under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Companies Ordinance</ENAMEX>.
Holders said they hoped the step would facilitate an eventual merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland Bank PLC</ENAMEX>. There has been speculation that the move to register the bank under the Companies Ordinance would remove a hurdle if the banks do decide to merge.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Purves</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai's</ENAMEX> chairman, told the meeting of fewer than 200 of the bank's nearly 183,000 shareholders that the board recommended the change to make the bank consistent with international standards and with all other listed companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
In a news briefing after the meeting, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purves</ENAMEX> did little to discourage rumors in the financial community that the bank was planning to move out of the colony -- even though the bank's century-old special ordinance requires that its headquarters be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> -- before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Nor did he damp speculation that the board was thinking about a merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai</ENAMEX> bought a 14.9% stake in the British bank in 1987.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Purves</ENAMEX> said some Midland officials had suggested a merger might be possible and said, ``I don't disagree with that.'' However, the bank chairman said the two banks weren't holding any discussions about a possible merger and that they still had a ``standstill'' agreement preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai</ENAMEX> from boosting its Midland stake until December 1990.
