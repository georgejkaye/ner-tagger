<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.V. Philips</ENAMEX> and its partners have granted a Japanese firm exclusive rights to promote and market equipment for suppliers of a new line of prerecorded audio/visual compact-disk products in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
The Dutch electronics group said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Research Center</ENAMEX> will begin by marketing authoring equipment it has developed for the so-called CD-I integrated compact-disk audio/visual system to software houses, publishers and video production companies.
These products will install information, sound and images onto the disks. A range of CD-I players and pre-recorded disks will become available commercially for professional users sometime next year, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>'s partners in the CD-I project are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp.</ENAMEX>, both of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
CD-I compact disks are capable of storing not only audio and moving video input, but also graphics and retrievable data on a single five-inch compact disk that would require specialized hardware for playback by the user. The CD-I systems would utilize video monitors.
