The Southeast prepared for the worst as Hurricane Hugo took aim at a 300-mile stretch of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> coast that hasn't been hit by such a major storm in a century.
With wind speeds rising to 135 miles an hour yesterday evening, Hugo posed a serious threat to coastal residents and property. More than 100,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas under orders from state officials, but they left behind numerous high-rise hotels, million-dollar beachfront properties and two of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>'s most historic antebellum cities, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Savannah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>
Most weather specialists said the hurricane would hit at high tide early this morning. While some predicted yesterday afternoon that the eye of the storm would strike Savannah, reports in the evening suggested that the hurricane might land farther north, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>.
Because of the high tide, many insurers feared the flood damage would be severe along the coastal areas. Moreover, a slow-moving storm like Hugo, which has been advancing at a pace of only about 20 miles an hour, is likelier to linger over land and cause more destruction.
Much of the coastal development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX> has taken place in the past five years -- a period in which no big storms have struck -- so the construction quality ``is completely untested,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Hafner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX>'s vice president in charge of claims field operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>.
Few people were willing to predict what residents would find upon their return. Houses that are ``300 feet back from the beach now could wind up with beachfront'' property, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert G. Liming</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>'s tourism director.
The toll in property could be very high. With urban centers and such richly developed communities as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilton Head</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Myrtle Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, in the path of the storm, U.S. insurers could have as much as $4 billion at risk, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Carolina Insurance News Service</ENAMEX>.
Many insurers have already deployed ``catastrophe teams'' to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> to handle the battery of claims they will see from homeowners and businesses. Meanwhile, some insurers are still trying to get a handle on losses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and other islands.
Most insurers said it was impossible to estimate what kinds of losses they might face at this point. But many of the claims that insurers process in the next few days will come from residential property owners, including losses for tony beachfront homes, luxury condominium high-rises and posh resorts. It could be a few days before insurance adjusters know the full extent of the damage, because many coastal areas, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilton Head</ENAMEX> and other islands, have been evacuated.
The stakes may be highest for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>, where tourism has nearly passed the textile industry as the state's top producer of income and jobs. Last year, travelers spent $4.7 billion there, providing for 98,000 jobs, mostly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilton Head</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Myrtle Beach</ENAMEX>.
Among the threatened areas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton</ENAMEX> Head features expensive resorts, including the 416-room <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westin Hotel</ENAMEX>, estimated to be worth $70 million; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyatt Regency</ENAMEX>, 505 rooms; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palmetto Dunes</ENAMEX>, 500 rooms; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>, 338 rooms. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fogelman Properties</ENAMEX>' famous Harbour Town marina and commercial development on the island is worth $75 million to $100 million, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Lapides</ENAMEX>, the company's senior vice president.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Myrtle Beach</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Keystone Plantation</ENAMEX>, a mixed development of hotels, villas and golf courses, was built at a cost of about $500 million.
Water is the main threat for low-lying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX>, where a tidal surge would swamp the cobblestone streets and lower floors of the elegant houses facing Fort <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sumter</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Sparks</ENAMEX>, a professor of civil engineering at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clemson University</ENAMEX>.
If the storm lands near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Savannah</ENAMEX>, it could also touch off a surge that might send 10 feet of water crashing onto <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Street</ENAMEX>, a swathe of affluent eateries and boutiques nestled together in century-old warehouses.
Savannah drew four million tourists last year who spent a collective $440 million, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhett Mouchet</ENAMEX>, a commercial real estate broker. Their visits were ``pretty much centered around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">River Street</ENAMEX>.''
Elsewhere, the danger would be wind, not water, said Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sparks</ENAMEX>, who added that many high-rise buildings at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Myrtle Beach</ENAMEX> were built with a ``light, cheap'' siding that would shear off. A single building, he said, sustained $300,000 in damage when brushed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurricane Diana</ENAMEX> in 1984.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prof. Sparks</ENAMEX> said that in some resort towns, insurance losses might be greater for the furnishings than for the structures themselves. ``People who own a quarter-million-dollar home don't have secondhand rugs on the floor.''
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX>, almost every major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> insurer has been jumping into action. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, the country's largest home insurer with 11.5 million policies, will fly in 110 adjusters by tomorrow morning to assist its regional staff. A truck loaded with computers, copiers, policy forms and other office equipment arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, yesterday to set up a temporary claims processing center.
By today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX>'s insurance unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allstate Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, will have 450 representatives, including local personnel, to start processing claims and assisting folks whose houses and property have been damaged. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adjusters</ENAMEX> will work out of blocks of hotel and motel rooms in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Raleigh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> to process claims.
Adjusters for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Co.</ENAMEX> will move into Savannah once the storm passes and start canvassing the region. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transamerica Corp.</ENAMEX> is monitoring the storm from its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> offices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transamerica</ENAMEX> covers most commercial property, such as small retail shops and business and light manufacturing operations in the storm's region, but not much waterfront property.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> will be writing checks on the spot for policyholders whose homes or businesses have been leveled or severely damaged. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allstate</ENAMEX> estimates it will pay about 95% of its claims on the scene and may write between 28,000 and 30,000 checks. Even so, it may take two months before all losses are reported, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Keillor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allstate</ENAMEX>'s regional CAT coordinator who's working out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, three U.S. companies insure a substantial amount of property -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American International Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Puerto Rican</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX> said it also has some exposure in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>, where information is scant, because no outsiders, not even insurers, have been allowed to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>. The companies said it's too early to estimate the amount of the claims.
Despite all their efforts to anticipate what kind of assistance might be needed after a major disaster, insurers don't always get everything just right. After a hurricane destroyed much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mobile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, in 1979, one insurer swooped in with electric typewriters, phones and other supplies for a makeshift claims office. But the storm knocked out the city's electric power and the insurer didn't bring any power generators. By candlelight, many claims checks were written by hand, recalls one agent who was on the scene.
