The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> adopted a ``charter of fundamental social rights'' that threatens to deepen a rift between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and other EC countries over how to achieve economic and political unity.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Affairs</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasso Papandreou</ENAMEX> emphasized that the charter, on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> heads of state are scheduled to vote in early December, ``can not be anything but a formal declaration'' with no binding effects. The charter aims to define basic rights, including minimum-wage guarantees and worker participation in corporate decision-making, for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> workers.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> said the commission would speed up its work on designing an ``action program'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> legislation to ensure that the rights enshrined in the charter are put into effect at the ``national, regional or local level.'' The action program will be ready by year end, she said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, however, is expected to strongly -- and single-handedly -- resist what it perceives as meddling in its internal social affairs. The final version of the charter approved by the commission isn't much different from a preliminary version presented in May and already rejected by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. The document ``continues to focus on areas that are best dealt with at the national level,'' a U.K. official said.
Commission President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Delors</ENAMEX> has been pushing hard for the charter. He sees it as a political litmus test of whether all 12 EC countries share the same conception of what a European society should be like.
But British Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> doesn't share the prevalent view on the Continent that minimum EC-wide standards on social policy are needed to ensure the success of the 1992 single-market program. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>, who during her 10 years in power has succeeded in reducing the unions' clout in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, fears that the charter would centralize control over the community's social policy in a few hands in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>.
Underscoring these differences, the commission's decision wasn't unanimous. Although a vote count wasn't disclosed, Competition Commissioner Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Brittan</ENAMEX>, a strong free-marketer, was said to have voted against the charter. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delors</ENAMEX> was disappointed by the lack of unanimity among the commissioners, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> official said. The commission president had hoped a consensus could be reached on a somewhat less far-reaching charter, but his peacemaking bid apparently failed because of pressure from the hard-liners on the panel. This lack of unanimity makes a consensus at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Ministers</ENAMEX> even less likely.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX>, however, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s approval isn't indispensable. If <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> refuses to go along, she said, the commission will seek to have as many measures as possible under the social-action program cleared by a majority vote -- as opposed to a unanimous vote -- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council of Ministers</ENAMEX>.
The rights defined by the charter aren't likely to be controversial in most EC countries, which already have extensive labor legislation. The charter is vague enough to allow for national differences in labor law, although it isn't intended to be without effects. ``Doubtless, some measures {to be adopted under the charter} will mean higher {labor} costs,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papandreou</ENAMEX> said, but ``the purpose is to achieve health and safety for our citizens.''
The charter spells out these basic rights and obligations:
-- The establishment of a ``decent wage'' and of ``a maximum duration of working time.'' The commission won't propose an EC-wide minimum wage or a maximum work week, but will leave these points to be decided at the national level.
-- The right for workers to ``information, consultation and participation'' in major corporate decisions affecting the work force, including technological changes, restructurings, mergers, collective layoffs and bankruptcies.
-- The right for workers to strike and join the union of their choice, and the right of unions to engage in collective bargaining.
-- The right to freedom of movement for workers, which ``shall imply entitlement to equal treatment with nationals of the host country in all fields, including social advantages and taxation.
