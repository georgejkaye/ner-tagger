<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>, which two days ago announced a proposed leveraged buy-out, named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph W. Deering</ENAMEX>, president of the company, as chief executive officer.
Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philips</ENAMEX> said that either Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deering</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Mccanna</ENAMEX>, chief operating officer, would succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Philips</ENAMEX> as chief executive. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philips</ENAMEX>, the founder of the company, is retiring Oct. 23 on his 75th birthday.
The company has also said that either Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deering</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccanna</ENAMEX> would be named chairman, but there was no indication yesterday on who would fill that post.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deering</ENAMEX>, 49 years old, assumes the chief executive position immediately.
Earlier this week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> board proposed a management-led $750 million leveraged buy-out. If approved, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> would merge with a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deering</ENAMEX> said the proposed buy-out expedited the chief executive announcement. ``We're in a transition anyway, so it seemed like the timely thing to do,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deering</ENAMEX> said the debt caused by the buy-out would force the maker of parts for building and transportation industries to curb future aquisitions and concentrate on existing operations.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deering</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> in 1985 as executive vice president of operations and has held a number of positions, including president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lasco Products Group</ENAMEX>.
