<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson General Corp.</ENAMEX> said it expects to post losses for the quarter and year ended June 30. It blamed the sale of the rest of its aircraft spare-parts inventory; it also cited plans to sell its equity in a Canadian air-freight transportation company.
Sale of the aircraft spare parts resulted in a $2.8 million charge to earnings in the quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> said. Sale of the equity interest will result in a ``significant charge'' but the amount hasn't been determined, it added.
In fiscal 1988, net income was $310,000, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $120 million.
