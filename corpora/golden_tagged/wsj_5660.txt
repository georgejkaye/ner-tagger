<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> tried to keep out American cigarettes. But where those economic powerhouses gave in, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX> is putting up a stiffer fight, and may win a compromise -- mainly because it has found an ally in the U.S. anti-smoking movement.
At a public hearing to be held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Trade Representative's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> today, a parade of congressmen and public-health advocates will testify in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>, the object of an unfair-trade complaint by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Cigarette Export Association</ENAMEX>.
In the past, such complaints had the full support of the federal government. But now, an outcry by the U.S. anti-smoking movement against the imposition of trade sanctions is forcing U.S. trade officials to re-examine their position. And while the Bush administration is likely to be extremely cautious about altering its policy, it might end up softening its demands.
Threats to punish a foreign country for resisting U.S. cigarettes, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Myers</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition on Smoking</ENAMEX> OR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>, are ``an international scandal.'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chester Atkins</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>), a leader of the anti-smoking movement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, asks, ``Why should we spend so much political capital on a harmful product like cigarettes when there are other things we can sell <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>, like agricultural products, high tech, and services?'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Democrat</ENAMEX> is scheduled to speak at the trade representative's hearing today, as is Surgeon General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Everett Koop</ENAMEX>, who will be appearing as a private citizen.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigarette Export Association</ENAMEX> -- made up of the three biggest cigarette makers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the cigarette units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> -- used to win handily because its complaints were treated strictly as matters of trade. But the anti-smoking movement is arguing trade policy should reflect another national goal -- discouraging tobacco use.
Fresh from its victory in persuading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> to approve a permanent smoking ban on domestic airline flights, the coalition, led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heart Association</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Lung Association</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX>, has thrown its weight behind <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thais</ENAMEX>, who appear intent on protecting their state-run tobacco monopoly, couldn't be happier. They don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s lobbying power, or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>'s or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s negotiating experience. But they did have the wits to contact the anti-smoking coalition shortly after Trade Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> accepted the cigarette exporters' complaint on May 25. Less than a week later, Thai diplomats stood with coalition members and their congressional backers at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> celebration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World No-Tobacco Day.</ENAMEX>
``We have our own anti-smoking people, and they are well-connected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. group</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Supavud Saicheua</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thai Embassy</ENAMEX>'s trade specialist. Asked about the irony of using the U.S. anti-smoking movement to protect his country's state-run cigarette monopoly, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saicheua</ENAMEX> argues that the clever advertising employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> cigarette companies would seduce more Thais into smoking.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigarette Export Association</ENAMEX> wants to keep health out of the discussion. ``The issue isn't whether people smoke or not, but who gets the business,'' contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Owen Smith</ENAMEX>, the association's president.
The association charges that by banning imports, the Thai Tobacco Monopoly deprives the U.S. of a reasonable share of a $744 million-a-year retail business. The group seeks a ``free and competitive'' market, including the right to advertise its brands on Thai television. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thai</ENAMEX> officials say all TV advertising of tobacco products is banned for public-health reasons.
Even if they don't win an outright victory, the anti-smoking group hopes to secure better terms for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX> than other countries gained. They hope, for example, to prevent U.S. exporters from gaining the right to promote their brands on Thai television. ``We'd have won if we get at least that,'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkins</ENAMEX> says.
So far, the U.S. trade office hasn't shown how it is leaning. If it supports the exporters, its recommendation will have to be reviewed at the cabinet level, and possibly by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> himself.
The Bush administration is likely to be extremely wary of siding with the anti-smoking movement. It can't easily dismiss the export question. One reason for the recent improvement in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade balance has been a boom in cigarette exports, which last year were valued at $2.6 billion, more than double the 1985 figure. The successful trade actions against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> accounted for much of that gain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has made few trade breakthroughs as dramatic as that.
What's more, any decision favoring the anti-smokers could set a legal precedent that might encourage other countries to invoke health reasons for contesting other U.S. trade actions involving foods, pharmaceuticals and other products.
