We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the ``Americans With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disabilities</ENAMEX> Act of 1989'' was ``crafted primarily by Democratic Senators <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harkin</ENAMEX>'' with a premise ``based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled....'' Perhaps even more offensive is the statement, ``It is surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy.''
This legislation was not drafted by a handful of Democratic ``do-gooders.'' Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Council</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Handicapped</ENAMEX>, all appointed by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>. You depict the bill as something Democratic leaders ``hoodwinked'' the administration into endorsing. The opposite is true: It's the product of many meetings with administration officials, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> staffers, advocates, and business and transportation officials. Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the ``Americans With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disabilities</ENAMEX> Act of 1989'' as a model for bipartisan deliberations.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Council</ENAMEX> members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities. We know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act: to be told there's no place for your child in school; to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair; to be denied employment because you are disabled.
Your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawyers' Employment Act.</ENAMEX>'' For the 43 million people with disabilities and their families, this legislation is the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emancipation Proclamation.</ENAMEX>''
