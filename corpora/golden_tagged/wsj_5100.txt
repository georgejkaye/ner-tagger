<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex Corp.</ENAMEX> and its unions haven't held negotiations this week and haven't scheduled any further talks on a new contract to end a seven-week strike.
A company spokesman said that talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Workers of America</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers</ENAMEX> broke down last weekend. Since then, neither side has taken steps to resume discussions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> spokesmen have said that talks are stalled over a company plan to shift some health-care costs to employees.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CWA</ENAMEX> represents about 40,000 Nynex employees while the IBEW represents 20,000.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CWA</ENAMEX> members must vote by today on a tentative agreement between union and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Telesis</ENAMEX> negotiators reached last month. Officials at some union locals are recommending against the proposed contract, raising the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pac Tel</ENAMEX> and the union will have to renegotiate parts of the agreement.
