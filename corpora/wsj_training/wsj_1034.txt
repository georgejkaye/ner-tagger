<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conferees agreed to continue production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX>'s F-14 and to provide more than $3.8 billion for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Defense Initiative</ENAMEX> during the current fiscal year.
Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill, hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days, provide a face-saving compromise for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Democrats. Although conferees are still putting the finishing touches on the package, the final agreement could be announced as early as tomorrow. An announcement is more likely next week, though.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and other supporters of SDI will be able to take credit for blocking House efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile system, which already has cost some $17 billion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>) and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conferees have opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> cuts, stalling for almost two months action on a number of big-ticket items in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s budget.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> voted to authorize $4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program, earmarked only $3.1 billion. Despite the widening gap between the two sides, conferees eventually followed the pattern set in previous years by opting to roughly split the difference. That would hold spending on the program at about the previous year's level.
The decision to keep the embattled F-14's production line running for at least another year is an important victory for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, and especially for Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Aspin</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wis.</ENAMEX>). As the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> conferees, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aspin</ENAMEX> has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject Senate provisions that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production.
The package ``provides a temporary, golden parachute for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX>,'' according to one congressional aide familiar with the closed-door bargaining. But as part of the overall agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> and its outspoken supporters on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year's budget.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> and most senators contend that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s F-14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> budgets. But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, where members are intent on saving Grumman jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier-based aircraft by the late 1990s.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conferees</ENAMEX> also agreed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> requests to earmark a total of nearly $1 billion for work on both mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midgetman</ENAMEX> nuclear missiles, according to congressional aides.
And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> nearly all of the $2.4 billion it wants for production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX>'s radar-eluding B-2 bombers, which cost $530 million apiece. The final B-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber's capabilities, but congressional aides said the accord won't include a House-passed provision that would have withheld production funds until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> approves a cheaper, scaled-down version of the $70 billion fleet of 132 B-2s envisioned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.
