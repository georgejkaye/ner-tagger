The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> overwhelmingly approved a compromise $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime initiative, while cutting domestic and defense spending accounts 0.43% to pay for it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senators</ENAMEX> voted 97-2 to attach the package to a measure appropriating $26.4 billion for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and highway and airport trust funds for the year beginning Sunday.
Conservative GOP Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jake Garn</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Steve</ENAMEX> Symms of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX> cast the only negative votes; Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>) missed the vote.
The underlying bill was passed 99-0. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference committee is to reconcile the bill with a competing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> version, which doesn't contain a similar anti-drug package. Key lawmakers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> have indicated both a willingness to accept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s spending level for anti-drug programs and an uneasiness with its funding mechanism.
The package, worked out with senators and the Bush administration in more than a week of talks, would set anti-drug spending authority in fiscal 1990 at $8.8 billion, $900 million above President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s proposal and $3.1 billion more than in the current fiscal year. Compared with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s plan, the compromise would place more emphasis on the drug treatment, education and prevention programs favored by the Democrats.
The measure approved yesterday, which also contains funds for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s anti-crime package, includes $1 billion for federal prison construction, another $1 billion for various federal treatment, education and prevention programs, $479.6 million for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies and $120.3 million for the federal judiciary.
It doesn't include increased anti-drug spending already incorporated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s other fiscal 1990 spending bills. Of the remainder of nearly $2.1 billion for drug programs, $1.3 billion would be offset by cuts in new defense budget authority, or about $797 million in direct spending. The rest of the budget, largely domestic accounts, would be cut by $700 million to $800 million in budget authority, or about $440 million in outlays.
Budget authority measures the level of money appropriated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to fund federal programs, and outlays represent the direct spending that results as these accounts are drawn down.
Under the agreement, all domestic accounts would be cut across the board by 0.3%. An additional 0.13% in savings would be determined by the 13 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Appropriations subcommittees. If any of those panels doesn't meet its reduction target, its budget allocation would be cut across the board.
In defense, all of the 0.43% reduction would be determined by the chairmen and ranking GOP members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Appropriations</ENAMEX> subcommittee on defense and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX>. The administration had sought the arrangement to protect personnel, readiness and continuing procurement accounts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>) has called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> package ``promising,'' but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Appropriations</ENAMEX> subcommittee chairmen have expressed reservations about the across-the-board spending cut and would rather have the flexibility to come up with their own cuts.
In approving the appropriations bill, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> approved on a voice vote an amendment sponsored by Sens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Danforth</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Hollings</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>) requiring random drug and alcohol testing of more than three million transportation workers, including pilots, truck drivers and railroad workers. Recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-passed legislation covers only railroad workers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> is gradually enacting rules requiring drug testing of transportation workers, but faces legal challenges from labor unions.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> floor action came as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX>'s ambassador to the U.S. suggested to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> panel that the U.S. spend $234 million annually to buy and destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peru</ENAMEX>'s huge crop of coca, the basic ingredient for cocaine.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cesar Atala Nazal</ENAMEX>, speaking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Government Affairs</ENAMEX> subcommittee on investigations, said that would be the first step in preventing cultivation of the plant. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atala</ENAMEX> said many of the 10,000 Peruvian farmers thought to be growing coca would welcome a U.S. buy-out as a chance to cease dealings with drug traffickers. But the ambassador said the plan would only work if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> also helped farmers substitute legal crops once the coca fields were destroyed.
Lawmakers were skeptical that the plan would eliminate coca growing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX> or in the other main growing country, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bolivia</ENAMEX>. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Levin</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>) suggested that even if current coca growers participated in such a program, other farmers would move into the market to get a guaranteed profit. Other senators said that Colombian traffickers would simply outbid the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for the crop.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atala</ENAMEX> also joined ambassadors from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bolivia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> in rejecting the notion of creating a multinational paramilitary strike force to attack drug traffickers. Such a force, which some American officials have discussed, could be used by anti-government insurgents ``as an excuse to promote violence which at this time doesn't exist,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolivian</ENAMEX> ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Delius</ENAMEX> told the panel.
