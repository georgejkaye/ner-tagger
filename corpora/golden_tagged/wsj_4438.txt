Assets of money funds advanced by $1.5 billion, while average yields remained unchanged in the week ended Tuesday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donoghue's Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> said.
Total assets of the 390 funds tracked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Holliston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, newsletter currently stand at $343.2 billion.
The average seven-day and 30-day compounded yields both remained at 8.6%. Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year.
The average seven-day and 30-day simple yields were also unchanged at 8.26%, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donoghue</ENAMEX>'s.
Average maturity -- to some an indicator of where professional investors think rates will move -- was unchanged at 37 days. Shortening maturities suggest higher interest rates on the horizon, while lengthening maturities hint rates will come down.
Earlier this week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banxquote Money Markets</ENAMEX>, an information service, reported that certificate of deposit yields rose slightly. The average yield on a six-month CD was 8.04%, compared with 8.01% a week earlier.
Those moves were partly a result of the higher yields paid on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> bills at the regular Monday auction. The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.22%, up from 8.06% a week earlier.
