<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rorer Group Inc.</ENAMEX> will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15% from a year earlier, though the gain is wholly due to asset sales, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Cawthorn</ENAMEX>, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said.
His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $17.4 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $15.2 million, or 48 cents a share, a year ago.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cawthorn</ENAMEX> said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of ``somewhat less than 10%.'' Through the first six months of 1989, sales had grown about 12% from the year-earlier period.
Growth of 10% would make sales for the latest quarter $269 million, compared with $244.6 million a year ago.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cawthorn</ENAMEX> said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asilone</ENAMEX>, an antacid, was sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boots PLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrombinar</ENAMEX>, a drug used to stanch bleeding, was sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jones Medical Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rorer</ENAMEX> sold the drugs for ``nice prices'' and will record a combined, pretax gain on the sales of $20 million.
As the gain from the sales indicates, operating profit was ``significantly'' below the year-earlier level, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cawthorn</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rorer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989. He said the company is still looking for ``a strong fourth quarter in all areas -- sales, operating income and net income.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cawthorn</ENAMEX> attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase, and to higher marketing expenses for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rorer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maalox antacid</ENAMEX>, whose sales and market share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> had slipped in the first half of 1989. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rorer</ENAMEX> opted to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asilone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrombinar</ENAMEX> to raise revenue that would ``kick start'' its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox, still its top-selling product with about $215 million in world-wide sales in 1988. ``We had underfunded Maalox for a year,'' he said, because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs.
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rorer</ENAMEX> will spend $15 million to $20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period. A ``big chunk'' of that additional spending came in the third quarter, he said.
