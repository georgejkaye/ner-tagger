(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
IN THE STAR-STUDDED GALAXY of mutual fund managers in the stock market's ``go-go'' years, one of the brightest was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Tsai</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX>-born entrepreneur who learned portfolio management in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, home of staid trust funds and the prudent-man rule.
A graduate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity Investment</ENAMEX> in 1952 at age 24. Five years later, he was allowed to set up his own fund. There he developed the gunslinger tactics that became the hallmark of the go-go funds. Basically, the technique involved picking ``glamour'' stocks too speculative for most funds and trading in and out of them at breakneck speed in 10,000-share blocks. By 1965, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> owned 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> and dreamed of succeeding founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Johnson</ENAMEX>. The boss preferred his son, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> sold out and headed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
By this time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> was a legend, one of a growing band of brash fund managers who won celebrity in the hot stock market. In the offering that underwriters made for his new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> Fund, Tsai expected a modest $25 million. He got $247 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> had all the props -- an office with a thermostat at 55 degrees to keep its occupant alert, an ``Information central'' with enough gimmicks to baffle an astronaut. But performance didn't match the hopes. The gloss was off the glamour stocks that were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX>'s trading staples. In contrast to disciples like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Carr</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enterprise Fund</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> stayed clear of the volatile over-the-counter issues that became the gunslingers' favorites. In 1968, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> Fund ranked last among the 310 funds tracked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Lipper</ENAMEX> survey.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> had the last laugh. In August 1968 he sold his firm to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNA Financial</ENAMEX>, ending up at 40 with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNA</ENAMEX> stock worth about $35 million. He is now chairman of the executive committee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerica Corp.</ENAMEX>, a big financial services company that was formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Can.</ENAMEX>
