and ex-brother-in-law -- for $90 million for allegedly mismanaging the pop star's finances.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Weber</ENAMEX> was fired as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>'s manager Aug. 30 after the entertainer's attorneys began reviewing various financial records. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Marks</ENAMEX>, a lawyer for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>, said the alleged improprieties date back to 1980, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> became the singer's exclusive manager.
``It's really quite a shocking story of trust,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marks</ENAMEX> said. The former manager ``had a very close, personal relationship with Billy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel.... Billy Joel</ENAMEX> had total faith that he was dealing with someone who was totally honest.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> became Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>'s manager after the entertainer and his wife at that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Weber</ENAMEX>, separated. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>'s sister, had been Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>'s manager; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marks</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> sided with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> when the couple split up.
Among other things, the lawsuit claims that, against the singer's instructions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> allowed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>'s song copyrights to be pledged as collateral for loans. The suit, filed in state court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, also accuses Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> of double-billing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> for song videos made by a Weber-controlled company.
The suit says that because of the fees and commissions to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> and his companies, the former manager made more money off some of the entertainer's tours and recordings than did Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>'s commission as manager was 20% of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>'s gross revenue. The commission amounted to about $12 million over the past three years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marks</ENAMEX> said. In addition, the suit says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> drew on the entertainer's assets for unauthorized, interest-free loans. The suit also claims that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> sustained a loss of at least $10 million on risky investments in horse-breeding partnerships, oil and natural gas, and real estate transactions arranged by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>. Often Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> had a personal stake in the investments, the lawsuit says, though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX>'s conflict of interest was never disclosed to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX>. ``We believe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> took substantial fees and commissions every time Billy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joel</ENAMEX> invested in one of his deals or partnerships,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marks</ENAMEX> said.
Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weber</ENAMEX> nor his attorney could be reached for comment on the suit.
JUDGE ORDERS LAWYERS to return $3.1 million in excess billings.
U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph C. Howard</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Annapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>, attorneys <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David A. Levin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James T. Wharton</ENAMEX> ``were vicariously liable'' for overbillings submitted by their former partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward S. Digges</ENAMEX>, even though they didn't participate in the fraud.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digges</ENAMEX>, former managing partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digges</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wharton & Levin</ENAMEX>, represented a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dresser Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> in asbestos litigation from 1984 to 1988 and submitted $4.5 million in total billings. In his ruling last month, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> characterized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digges</ENAMEX>'s billing practices as ``grossly fraudulent and willful.''
The judge found Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wharton</ENAMEX> and Levin liable along with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digges</ENAMEX> because the firm had no monitoring system in place to ensure the accuracy of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digges</ENAMEX>'s bills or to prevent fraud. The judge ordered that $3.1 million be returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dresser</ENAMEX> unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harbison Davidson Refractories Inc.</ENAMEX>
Lawyers for Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wharton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levin</ENAMEX> declined comment. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Digges</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached.
A jury trial is planned to determine what, if any, punitive damages to assess.
A WEEK OF <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMNESTY</ENAMEX> for pilferers of court files pays off in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>.
The files weren't making it back to the county clerk's office after court proceedings, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travis County Clerk Dana Debeauvoir</ENAMEX> offered attorneys, law clerks and other courthouse personnel a chance to return the files last week with no questions asked.
The clerk's office handles records for 47,000 misdemeanor criminal cases and 41,000 civil cases on an ``open-shelf'' system that allows lawyers and others to fetch the files themselves. Trouble was, 10% of the files weren't being returned for days and sometimes weeks after a court proceeding.
``I don't have any files that are permanently missing,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debeauvoir</ENAMEX> said. ``I just have a revolving door that got stuck.''
The clerk concedes she lacks enforcement power when a file is overdue but said the declaration of an amnesty week was a way of drawing attention to the problem. And although she doesn't have hard data, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debeauvoir</ENAMEX> said the amnesty did inspire many attorneys to return the files. ``I just wanted to raise their consciousness that it's not okay to borrow a file for a while,'' she said.
PERIPATETIC PROSECUTORS: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celia Goldwag Barenholtz</ENAMEX>, the former chief appellate attorney in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney's office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, has become a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kronish</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lieb, Weiner & Hellman</ENAMEX>, a 78-lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm. She will handle criminal and civil cases.... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein</ENAMEX> has recruited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura A. Brevetti</ENAMEX> as a partner and co-head of the 50-lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm's white-collar crime group. She was formerly chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Justice</ENAMEX> Organized Crime strike force in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUOTABLE</ENAMEX>: In an opinion largely backing insurers in a Superfund toxic-waste cleanup case, state court judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert H. Dierker Jr.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> took the opportunity to comment on ``loss spreading,'' a theory holding that those who share the benefits of industrialization must all share in its costs. The judge said such notions ``are merely'critical legal studies' code words to disguise methods by which courts can be utilized as devices for imposing socialist or Marxist economics through perversion of the common law.'' Needless to say, the judge rejected this approach.
