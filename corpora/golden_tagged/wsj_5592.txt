<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craig Corp.</ENAMEX> said it will seek shareholder approval at a Nov. 10 special meeting of a newly proposed recapitalization granting holders of existing common stock considerable voting power while creating a new class of common with preferential liquidation rights.
The company, whose principal investment is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stater Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> supermarket chain, said it expects to use newly created Class A common stock to raise money for debt repayment and to accelerate the growth of its business through acquisitions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craig</ENAMEX> stock climbed 75 cents a share yesterday to $42.25 in composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading. The company said stock of record Oct. 6 will be eligible to vote at the special meeting.
A company spokesman said the proposed changes aren't related to the accumulation of a 9% stake in the company by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucaipa Capital Partners Limited Partnership</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucaipa</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Claremont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, has said among other things that it might seek control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX>.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yucaipa</ENAMEX> said the partnership hadn't had time to study <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX>'s proposal but called the recapitalization appealing ``on the surface'' because it may enhance the stock's marketability and provide new funds for investment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craig</ENAMEX> said it will ask holders to approve conversion of existing common stock into new common having 30 votes attached to each share. That new stock hasn't been given a name, the spokesman said.
The new Class A stock would be created having only one vote per share but certain preferential liquidation rights. The company said it is exploring, through Bear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX> a possible private placement of the Class A common stock.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craig</ENAMEX> currently has 2.3 million common shares outstanding, which, as reported, will double Sept. 29 with payment of a 100% stock dividend. The company spokesman said the amount of Class A stock to be authorized hasn't been decided.
