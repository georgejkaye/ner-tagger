A federal jury decided against awarding any punitive damages to the daughter of the founder of Mail Boxes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Etc.</ENAMEX>, who claimed that the company and its top official fraudulently induced her to sell her 23% stake.
Thursday, the jury had awarded plaintiff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Tash</ENAMEX>, daughter of the company's late founder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Aul</ENAMEX>, $2.5 million in compensatory damages to be paid by the company. The jury further found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Desio</ENAMEX>, Mail Boxes' president and chief executive officer, should pay more than $1.5 million in compensatory damages. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Goffstein</ENAMEX>, a defendant and a former company official, wasn't found liable for any damages.
In her lawsuit, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tash</ENAMEX> alleged that the company and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desio</ENAMEX> defrauded her in 1983 by inducing her to sell 700,000 shares of the company's stock for $50,000 and a $300,000 note to a new company controlled by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desio</ENAMEX>. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tash</ENAMEX> alleged that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desio</ENAMEX> had devised a scheme to make her believe that the company was performing poorly, when it was in fact posting higher sales. The company said it plans to appeal the verdict.
