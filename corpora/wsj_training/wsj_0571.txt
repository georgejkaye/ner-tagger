Last week the British displayed unusual political immaturity. The Chancellor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Exchequer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX>, resigned because Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> would not fire her trusted adviser Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX>. The opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Party</ENAMEX> leader, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Kinnock</ENAMEX>, in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class, denounced Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet. The British press, making a mountain out of a molehill, precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government.
Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark. Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> considers this an ill-advised and costly policy. As there is an effort to ``anchor the dollar'' either to gold or other currencies, the dispute is worth examining.
Until his resignation, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark. When Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> cut the top tax rate to 40%, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark. As a result, he reignited the inflation that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>, through a long and costly effort, had subdued.
With inflation surging, the pound began falling against the mark. To keep the exchange rate pegged, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15%. This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s policies had created, producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls.
Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s political fortune, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX>, which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy. This put Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> in a bind. The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals, the media and the imagination, but are full of practical pitfalls.
If the pound had been tied to the mark, the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates. The reason is simple. When a country cuts tax rates, it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency.
It was fear of disturbing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX> exchange-rate relationships that caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chirac</ENAMEX> government in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> to be timid about cutting tax rates. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edouard Balladur</ENAMEX>, the finance minister at the time, was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship.
The price of attracting capital -- whether one's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit. To avoid this deficit Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise. This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consequently</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> saddled Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row. Little wonder that Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> in office.
It is extraordinary that the British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound. The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40%, the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986. This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account, a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s. The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment, instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates. This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle. First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction. Then, when the currency falls, interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate. This policy is totally mindless, and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> is correct to point out its deficiencies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>. A unified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> that remained within the Western alliance would give <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> would become vassals of the German state. Unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> collapses, German reunification is likely to require <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s neutralization. The implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s resignation to be unfortunate.
In the least, we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of tax-rate reduction on capital flows.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> was assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary under President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>.
