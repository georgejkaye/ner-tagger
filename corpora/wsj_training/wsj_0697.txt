<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition Partners</ENAMEX>, a hostile suitor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts Corp.</ENAMEX>, filed a petition in federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> seeking to have its standstill agreement with the computer printer maker declared void, and it proceeded with a $10-a-share tender offer for the company.
The offer would give the transaction an indicated value of $189 million, based on the 18.9 million shares the group doesn't already own. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC</ENAMEX> holds about 7.8% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX>' shares.
Lawyers representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC</ENAMEX> declined to elaborate, saying they didn't have a final copy of the filing. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Davis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX>' chairman, said he hadn't yet seen the filing and couldn't comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC</ENAMEX> made a $15-a-share bid for the company in May, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX> management considered the $283.7 million proposal unacceptable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX> had sought a buyer for several months, but it is now in the midst of a restructuring plan and management says the company is no longer for sale.
