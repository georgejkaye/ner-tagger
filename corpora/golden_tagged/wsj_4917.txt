The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> enters the last week of this fiscal year unable to break the impasse over anti-drug funding that has stalled action on most appropriations for fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday.
Talks abruptly broke off Friday, and although some lawmakers were still hopeful for an eventual agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> will have to rely on a stopgap, omnibus spending bill to keep the government operating past next weekend. A one-month spending bill is scheduled to be considered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> tomorrow.
The dominant personality last week in the five days of talks over increased spending for law enforcement and anti-drug programs has been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Byrd</ENAMEX>. It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Virginia</ENAMEX> Democrat who two weeks ago offered an alternative to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s anti-drug plan, and it was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX>, frustrated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, who suspended talks.
A major question now is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> leaders will step in to fill the vacuum they've allowed to develop. The breakup of the talks puts pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> to become more directly involved. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> Democrat has held back in apparent deference to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX>, his predecessor as leader, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> risks looking weak if the talks fall apart after the two sides appeared to be so close to agreement.
When the talks broke off, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> was aboard a plane to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>. Earlier, he had said it would be ``tragic'' for the Bush administration to block an agreement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Republicans have relied heavily on Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Hatfield</ENAMEX>, the senior GOP member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX>, because of his relationship with Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> liberal shares many of the Democrats' priorities, but he appears to have been held in check at important points by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, which may be forced now to step forward and explain why it can't move further.
Tired and tense, both sides sought Friday to shift the blame to the other. Each side will find it hard to say why a settlement can't be reached. There is so much impatience with the drawn out negotiations that many senators would prefer to see the issue fought out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> floor.
When the talks were suspended, only $150 million separated the two sides' proposed additions to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s $7.9 billion proposal. Democrats had given ground by agreeing to pursue selective, individual, spending reductions, rather than offsetting all of the increased spending with across-the-board cuts as they had initially insisted, and by agreeing to give the administration the flexibility it sought to protect certain military-spending accounts.
In return, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> hoped the Republicans would move closer to the Democrats' $1 billion figure for additional spending authority, which was already well below their initial demand and which Democratic participants described as ``bottom line.'' But GOP lawmakers held firm at $850 million.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> was said to be especially frustrated because Republican senators had discussed the possibility of a $900 million increase but clung to the lower number after consultations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> Chief of Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Sununu</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Darman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett</ENAMEX>, the administration's director of anti-drug policy.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byrd</ENAMEX> said the next move was up to the Republicans, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hatfield</ENAMEX> said he hoped talks would resume with ``a clear-eyed Monday morning view.'' Leaving the Capitol on Friday afternoon, though, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sununu</ENAMEX> said, ``We're in no hurry.''
The stalemate leaves four major spending bills funding as many as a half-dozen federal departments and the entire U.S. foreign aid budget stalled on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> floor, as Republicans have blocked their final passage while differences remained on the anti-drug package.
Another bill, covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce, Justice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Departments</ENAMEX> and the federal judiciary, has been held up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX>. Today, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> is expected to begin work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> spending bill.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has given final approval to only one of the 13 bills needed to fund the government in the new spending year, and unless negotiations can produce a settlement, lawmakers face a potentially long fight over the high-profile drug issue.
