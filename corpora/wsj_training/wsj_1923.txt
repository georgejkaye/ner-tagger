<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> may be about to intensify the cola wars.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> said it will test market a caffeine-free version of its flagship brand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Classic</ENAMEX>, beginning next week in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX> Other, as yet unnamed, cities will follow. If all goes well, the product will be rolled out for national sales sometime next year, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
After the confusion surrounding the change of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> formula in 1985, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> was reluctant to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension. But now, the soft-drink giant appears willing to take the risk.
``The name Classic Coke has tremendous value, and they haven't merchandised that name before,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Meyers</ENAMEX>, publisher of the trade journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beverage Digest</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> spokesman said a caffeine-free Classic should help increase volume of the original brand. Indeed, analysts have said that the absence of new products, among other factors, has limited sales growth throughout the industry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> now leads Pepsi in market share in caffeine-free diet colas but trails Pepsi in sales of caffeine-free sugared colas, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beverage Digest</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> introduced a caffeine-free sugared cola based on its original formula in 1983. It switched to a caffeine-free formula using its new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> in 1985.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> has been studying the possibility of introducing a caffeine-free Classic for a year, a company spokesman said. He said large increases in sales of other non-caffeine soft drinks make the timing right now.
