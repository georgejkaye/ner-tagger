<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks ended generally higher Friday, helped by index-linked buying by investment trust funds that came to the market several times during the day.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> stocks closed moderately lower in thin trading.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stock prices opened firm as sentiment improved after Thursday's substantial advances, traders said. However, stocks failed to sustain their early gains as the trading was extremely unfocused, traders added.
Many of Thursday's winners lost strength as investors took profits and then shifted their attention to other issues.
Investor interest was mainly targeted at issues whose prices seemed to move up quickly. They were selected individually regardless of sector or theme, reflecting an investor attitude of avoiding longer-term commitments to any specific shares, traders said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index of 225 selected issues was up 26.77 points at 34771.79. It gained 274.44 Thursday.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Monday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index rose 179.83 points to 34951.62.
Friday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 650 million shares, about the same as the previous session's 655 million.
Despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX>'s gain, declining issues outnumbered advancing shares, 494 to 463, while 169 remained unchanged.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Stock Price Index (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Topix</ENAMEX>) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 17.94 points Thursday, was down 4.12 points, or 0.16%, at 2629.40.
The Second Section index, which gained 23 points Thursday, was up 35.06 points, or 1.02%, to close at 3484.95. Volume in the Second Section was estimated at 26 million shares, unchanged from Thursday.
Amid uncertainty about exchange rate directions and domestic interest rates, institutional investors remained sidelined through the week.
On the other hand, participating investors, mostly individuals, avoided large-capital issues such as steels and constructions, rotating their attention through smaller-capital, incentive-backed issues. Those related to speculation about mergers and acquisitions, such as retail and local bank issues, made notable gains during the week.
The week also saw meetings held by the Big Four brokerage houses to set their October-March strategies. The four agreed to concentrate on an ``upgraded life style'' theme emphasizing housing and retail issues based on growing domestic consumption.
Most-recommended lists issued by the brokerages were characterized by fewer large-capitalization issues such as steels and more consumer-oriented issues.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX> surged 480 yen ($3.29) to 4,950 yen ($33.99). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> gained 140 to 8,400. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanuc</ENAMEX> advanced 300 to 7,400 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX> was up 190 to close at 5,580.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursday</ENAMEX>'s winners, retail issues, ended mixed Friday as some investors sold these issues on profit-taking.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seiyu</ENAMEX> gained 180 to 2,900 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiei</ENAMEX> added 40 to 3,130 but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ito-Yokado</ENAMEX> lost 10 to 4,560. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isetan</ENAMEX> ended flat.
Steels were lower. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Steel</ENAMEX> dropped to 752 yen, its lowest level since the beginning of this year, down 15 from Thursday's close.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, share prices dropped amid the exodus of buyers ahead of the Group of Seven industrialized nations summit this past weekend.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times-Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> 100-share index closed down 10.7 points at 2370.2, nominally above its session low of 2369.7, and well below the day's high of 2382.1 recorded near the opening.
The narrower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 30-share index finished at 1949.5, down 13.4. Total volume was 452.9 million shares, up from 413.8 million Thursday but still very light for a Friday.
Besides concerns over potential action by the G-7 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> over the weekend, dealers said limited action on Wall Street gave scant direction to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, which in turn drifted lower throughout the day as more and more players left ahead of the weekend.
The major feature of the session was Boots, a U.K. health-care retailer and pharmaceuticals concern, which shed 26 pence (41 cents) to 290 pence ($4.58) a share after the company said clinical trials of a heart drug showed it was less successful than expected in treating congestive heart failure. Boots was relatively active at 21 million shares, but 19 million of the total was traded before midday, which dealers said underscored the market's action overall.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaxo</ENAMEX>, which fell sharply earlier in the week on profit-taking after its relatively positive interim results, added 8 to # 15.39 ($24.30) on the Boots news, dealers said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaxo</ENAMEX> produces several cardiovascular products.
Luxury car maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> motored ahead again as rumors abounded about possible link-ups with other major car companies, and the market shrugged off a statement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s board that any takeover would be unwelcome. It ended the session at 581, up 33.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewan Fraser</ENAMEX>, an automotive analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Capel & Co.</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s shares appear to be extremely overbought on the hostile-bid speculation. ``Its share price is really three times what it should be,'' he said. ``It's all speculative driven.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Chartered</ENAMEX> advanced 19 to 557. Dealers said the shares were bolstered by talk that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX>, one of the four U.K. clearing banks, may mount a bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based commercial bank.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawker Siddeley</ENAMEX>, a major British engineering concern, slipped 16 to 720. Dealers attributed the decline to a sharp drop in earnings reported by a U.S. heavy machinery manufacturer in which it holds a stake.
Some dealers rejected the talk and largely attributed the move to profit-taking and thin volume. Only 1.2 million shares were traded.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas Industries</ENAMEX>, an aerospace and automotive concern, rose 12 to 680 on modest volume.
Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and were lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellington</ENAMEX>.
Share prices closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan</ENAMEX>; lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stockholm</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and mixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX>. South African gold stocks closed firmer.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.
