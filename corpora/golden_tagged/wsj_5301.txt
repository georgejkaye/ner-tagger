I find it necessary to challenge a very misleading story on Sept. 13 about my agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell-Mithun-Esty</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CME</ENAMEX>). The headline, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> Is Fighting Loser Image at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell-Mithun-Esty</ENAMEX> Unit,'' and the story that accompanies it imply that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CME</ENAMEX> as a whole is encountering difficulties.
Unfortunately, this coverage perpetuates a certain predisposition toward filing stories about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> advertising industry from a predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> perspective. While our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office has gone through several disappointing developments of late, the impact of these changes on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CME</ENAMEX>'s system as a whole is quite limited. In fact, our billings are up 8% for the year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell-Mithun-Esty</ENAMEX> is an $850 million agency with full-service offices in seven markets throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, and with field-service locations in 22 other markets. Our operations are geographically dispersed to capitalize on the realities of consumer behaviors and attitudes throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>.
