When President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> travels to Costa Rica today, he'll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels. But the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration's policies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>.
Some conservatives say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> shouldn't make the trip, during which he will participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX>'s celebration of 100 years of democracy. These critics object to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> among the guests. In addition, they argue he won't help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s standing in the region by trumpeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an ineffectual role in the failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>.
``I believe it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtin Windsor</ENAMEX>, who served as U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica during the Reagan administration. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windsor</ENAMEX>, among other analysts connected to the conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage Foundation</ENAMEX>, fears the gathering of 18 leaders, mostly from Central American nations, will force Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> ``to explain and redeem himself'' in the wake of charges that the U.S. failed to do enough to aid the removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX>.
At the same time, liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid to the tiny country. The administration proposed only $57 million in so-called economic support funds for Costa Rica this year, down from the $90 million the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> provided last year.
The administration said improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX>'s economic condition warrant the cut in aid, which the country uses mainly to make payments on its $4.5 billion foreign debt. But Costa Rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices, combined with the country's continuing struggle to reinvigorate its economy, make the support as necessary as ever.
``We are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodrigo Sotela</ENAMEX>, an economic affairs specialist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> Embassy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
Democrats argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> deserves more assistance for the same reason that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is attending the celebration this weekend: to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>.
However, peace efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rican</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Arias</ENAMEX> haven't always helped the country's cause in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arias</ENAMEX>'s long-time refusal to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s campaign against leftist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> earned him the ire of the Reagan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. And more recently, he insisted on signing a five-nation agreement intended to disarm <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-backed Contra rebels faster than the Bush administration would prefer.
``I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s going there is a helpful sign,'' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Sanford</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>) a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> who pushed to provide Costa Rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year. Lawmakers in both houses support the higher level.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> officials defend Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s decision to make the trip. While they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>, they insist that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> won't be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies. The administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist Nicaraguan government in recent days, endorsing a package of electoral aid to the Nicaraguan opposition, renewing the U.S. trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region.
Officials also insist Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region, fighting illegal drugs and assisting the less developed countries.
``Let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip,'' Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> told reporters Wednesday. ``There won't be any formal resolutions or communiques, I don't think. But we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many, many very important issues.
