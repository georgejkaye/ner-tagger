<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> is known for throwing its weight around in the financial markets, but one of its traders apparently went overboard on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> a few months ago.
In one of the most unusual disciplinary actions it has ever meted out, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> yesterday said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> floor broker was censured and fined $2,500 for allegedly disrupting -- through verbal outbursts and ``physically reckless'' actions -- the gala opening ceremony on Feb. 14 for a newly listed stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange</ENAMEX> traders identified the stock as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S.p. A.</ENAMEX> The broker, 45-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas P. Breen</ENAMEX>, settled the disciplinary proceeding without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
The case was one of 11 announced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> yesterday, including one against a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Bank Corp.</ENAMEX> subsidiary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBCI Swiss Bank Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment Banking</ENAMEX>, for alleged capital-reserve violations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBCI</ENAMEX> settled the case, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, by paying a $150,000 fine.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> case has been talked about for months on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading floor. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breen</ENAMEX>, a floor broker with 21 years experience on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>, is described in the exchange's disciplinary decision No. 89-57 as having ``barged'' through the opening ceremonies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> so he could place a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> order for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> shares.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> routinely has such opening ceremonies for the 150 or so stocks newly listed on the exchange each year.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Agnelli</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX>, the giant Italian auto  maker, were smiling for cameras during the morning of Feb. 14, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breen</ENAMEX> took the actions, according to traders who were there.
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> disciplinary decision describes it, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breen</ENAMEX> ``felt he was unable to get an order executed due to the group that was assembled for the ceremonies.'' A floor supervisor cleared a path for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breen</ENAMEX> around the group, ``yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breen</ENAMEX> failed to use the path'' and instead ``engaged in inappropriate verbal outbursts, and acting in a physically reckless manner, barged through the participants assembled for the ceremonies,'' according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>.
These alleged actions violated Exchange Rule 401 governing good business practices, the exchange said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breen</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached to comment. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trader sympathetic to him called the case ``slightly unusual,'' and said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breen</ENAMEX> just got caught up in a crowded, ``kind of get-out-of-my-way situation there.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> officials had no comment.
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> disciplinary cases are for conventional trading or accounting violations. Yet every so often there is an unusual enforcement action; in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, for example, the exchange censured and handed out a $1,000 fine to a broker who allegedly failed to stay with two guests on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> trading floor, causing them to engage in ``disruptive behavior.''
In the case concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBCI Swiss Bank Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment Banking</ENAMEX>, the exchange said that, among other things, the firm erred in computing its reserve requirements and thus failed to maintain minimum net capital.
The exchange also took disciplinary action against nine other individuals for what it called violations of its rules and of federal securities laws. The decisions the exchange reached ``may be subject to further review by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBCI</ENAMEX> settled the exchange's charges without admitting or denying them. The case arose from a review of the firm's books conducted by exchange examiners in 1986 and 1987. The firm formerly was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Bank Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Securities.</ENAMEX>
The 1986 report says the firm didn't comply with minimum-capital requirements ``on three dates on which underwriting commitments became effective,'' according to the exchange.
During March to May 1986, the firm's weekly computation of its reserve requirement for a bank account used for the exclusive benefit of customers ``was not prepared as required,'' the exchange said.
Also, when the exchange conducted its 1986 review, ``the firm did not have adequate procedures to supervise and control certain areas of the firm's sales practice activities,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> said.
The exchange said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBCI</ENAMEX> called the errors ``inadvertent and unintentional,'' and said the firm has taken corrective action, including replacing certain personnel, adopting a more-sophisticated data-processing system, and implementing additional security measures and accounting controls.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBCI</ENAMEX> reiterated that the events took place three years ago and that the company corrected its procedures. He declined further comment.
The exchange also permanently barred four individuals from working for an exchange member because of what it called improper conduct or misappropriation of customer securities. They are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen H. Gorman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Troy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monty Lee Jackson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Morris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Villalobos</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Foster City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jungho Yu</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>. Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> also were censured. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yu</ENAMEX> neither admitted nor denied the exchange's allegations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen Ann Koopman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, was barred until she complies with an exchange request for data. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Mitchell Podufaly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Waban</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, received a censure and a three-year bar for violations including failing to comply with an exchange request for testimony.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Nicholas Zurek</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deerfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, consented to a censure, a 4 1\ bar, and a permanent bar from any supervisory post. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, he consented to findings that he, among other things, exercised discretionary power in accounts without first getting written authorization from customers.
The exchange found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Philip Berman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Key Biscayne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, entered trades in two customer accounts and exercised certain discretionary power in two accounts without proper authorization. Without admitting or denying the findings, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berman</ENAMEX> consented to a censure and a three-year bar.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Alan Schneider</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fair Haven</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, registered competitive market maker, consented to exchange findings that, among other things, he failed to engage in certain transactions that would contribute to a fair and orderly market. He didn't admit or deny wrongdoing, but he consented to a censure, a $5,000 fine, and a bar from registration as a market maker for three years.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berman</ENAMEX> said, ``I'm not in the business any longer. I didn't do anything wrong, but who cares?''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yu</ENAMEX> declined to comment. Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jackson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Villalobos</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Podufaly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurek</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schneider</ENAMEX> and Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koopman</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
