<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Federal Bank</ENAMEX> said it adopted a shareholder-rights plan that allows holders to purchase common stock at half the market price in the event of a takeover attempt.
Among other things, the rights plan will distribute one right to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock for each of its common shares outstanding.
The plan, which takes effect Oct. 12, may be triggered by a tender offer for at least 20% of the company's common stock, or the actual acquisition of at least 15%.
In a statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas R. Ricketts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Federal</ENAMEX> chairman, said, ``The plan is designed to ensure that all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Federal</ENAMEX>'s shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover and to discourage abusive takeover techniques. While not preventing a takeover, the rights should encourage anyone seeking to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Federal</ENAMEX> to negotiate first with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Federal</ENAMEX>'s board.''
The rights plan expires Oct. 12, 1999.
