Much of the estimated $1.2 billion windfall from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX>'s expected  sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> is likely to be reinvested in the company's overseas soft-drink businesses, analysts say.
The anticipated sale isn't likely, however, to put an end to the mixed reviews the soft drink giant has received since it made the leap into the movie business with the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> in 1982.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> wouldn't say what it would do with the proceeds, or otherwise comment on the expected sale of its 49% stake, except to say that, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> shareholder, it will review any recommendation it receives from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s board.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> has been restructuring many of its bottlers around the world, making them bigger and more efficient and, in some cases, buying bigger stakes in them. Many analysts expect that activity to intensify with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> windfall. Analysts also expected the company, which will complete a two-year 40-million stock buy-back by year end, to repurchase more of its shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> isn't likely to start looking for other major acquisitions, even though, as of June 30, it had only $2.6 billion in total debt and $1.42 billion in cash. The company's chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto C. Goizueta</ENAMEX>, has said many times that the company intends to focus on its soft-drink business and isn't interested in taking any major, costly digressions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> has ``shied away from additional legs to the business and made it abundantly clear they have more than adequate uses for their funds in bottlers abroad,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Goldman</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Research Institute</ENAMEX>.
The company's last major diversification foray was the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, which drew stinging criticism from analysts and investors who chided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> for straying so far from its predictable soft-drink business and overpaying in a cash and stock transaction valued at $692 million.
Some analysts still believe the venture was a mistake. Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s management was fraught with turnover and its movie business, after several strong years, floundered. The company never did accomplish its goal of making the entertainment business a predictably fast-growing third leg to its soft drink and food concerns.
But several analysts and industry executives close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> say the company will emerge from its experience in entertainment smelling like roses. ``Some people say they didn't make a successful go in the movie business,'' says an executive close to the company. ``But if they didn't make a successful go, how did Columbia get to be worth so much?''
Certainly, some of the runup in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s stock has been on takeover rumors. But he and others note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> made several clever acquisitions to build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s entertainment business. Then its creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment</ENAMEX> in January 1988 was particularly advantageous to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment</ENAMEX> was formed through the merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>'s entertainment business sector, which included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>'s 37%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tri-Star Pictures</ENAMEX> unit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> then reduced its 80% ownership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> to 49% by issuing about 30 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> shares to its holders.
Those moves allowed Coke to retain some chunks of choice <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> real estate, including its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> and $545 million in cash. The timing of the deal was also astute, coming before some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s worst problems.
The transaction has also proved valuable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> shareholders as well. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> issued the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> stock to its shareholders, it was valued at $7.44 a share. ``They will have multiplied the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> assets to three or four maybe more times their value,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Romm</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> ``I think they've done very well for their holders.''
In composite trading yesterday on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> shares closed at $63, up 62.5 cents.
