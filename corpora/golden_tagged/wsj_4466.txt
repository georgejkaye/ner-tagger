<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX>, in an aggressive bid to boost U.S. market share, is raising 1990 base prices on its most popular car lines by 2.5% or less from 1989 levels.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>'s pricing, along with similar modest increases by other foreign car makers, doesn't bode well for American auto makers, analysts said.
Foreign auto makers will boost their share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> car market to 41.5% in 1990 from 36.7% this year, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Glantz</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery Securities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
Japanese auto makers raised prices substantially in 1987 and 1988, as the declining value of the dollar forced up the prices of imported goods. But now, Japanese auto makers like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> have largely overcome that disadvantage. Despite a recent drop, the value of the dollar has risen about 5% against the yen since a year ago. Moreover, Japanese auto makers are increasingly protected from currency fluctuations because they are building some of their best-selling models in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Now, as they battle for market share on a more-level playing field, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> and the Japanese are pursuing sharply different strategies.
The Big Three U.S. auto makers are boosting base sticker prices on most 1990 models by 6% to 8%. But they are giving all or part of these increases back in the form of cash rebates to customers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, for instance, already has announced rebates of as much as $1,000 on certain 1990 models, even though the model year doesn't start officially until Sunday.
But the major Japanese auto makers, as well as some European companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen AG</ENAMEX>, are raising 1990 prices much less aggressively and signaling that they don't plan to rely heavily on rebates. ``Our policy is that if the car is priced properly to begin with, you don't have to pay somebody to buy it,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
If Japanese auto makers are forced into offering rebates to keep their U.S. factories running profitably, they now have more flexibility to do so, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack V. Kirnan</ENAMEX>. The Japanese can build cars in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for $500 per vehicle less than their Big Three rivals, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kirnan</ENAMEX> said.
``It's just a question of who can cut prices faster and who can protect their margins, and it seems to me the Japanese have an advantage there,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> said it is virutally maintaining 1989 prices on most 1990 versions of its compact Camry. That model, which competes against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> Accord and some Big Three midsize models, accounts for 37% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>'s U.S. sales, and is now being built at a factory in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX>.
For example, a 1990 Camry Sedan DLX with an automatic transmission will start at $13,078, unchanged from this year. A 1990 Camry Sedan with a standard five-speed transmission will start at $11,588, just $100 more than the 1989 model. The cheapest 1990 Camry equipped with a multi-valve V-6 engine will start at $13,698, up only $60 from a year ago.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> is raising prices most sharply on its cheapest car, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tercel EZ</ENAMEX>. That model will start at $6,488 for 1990, up $160, or 2.5%, from 1989.
