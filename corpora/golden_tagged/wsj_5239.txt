<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cummins Engine Co.</ENAMEX> said it expects to report a ``substantial'' third-quarter loss because of sharply lower demand, higher-than-normal warranty costs and production inefficiencies.
As a result, the company said it plans to cut expenses immediately, including a 5% work force reduction at four <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> plants. Production levels for its engine, parts and power system groups will shrink because of reduced demand, the company said. About 200 workers will be laid off Oct. 1.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cummins</ENAMEX> said income orders for North American heavy-duty trucks have fallen significantly below industry production rates over the past five months. August's 6,400 orders were the lowest since April 1983, the company said.

In addition to various expense-reducing measures, the company said it would implement what it called ``stringent restrictions on working capital.''
