On Wall Street yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern California</ENAMEX>'s killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck.
At the opening bell, investors quickly began singling out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> disaster, including insurers, construction-related companies, refiners and housing lenders. Brokerage houses jumped in, touting ``post-quake demand'' stocks, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> set up a toll-free hot line for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Franciscans</ENAMEX> who might need emergency investment advice and help in transferring funds.
``Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Gallagher</ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oppenheimer & Co.</ENAMEX> trader. However, he added, such event-driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information.
The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Re Corp.</ENAMEX>, which rose $2.75 to $86.50, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nac Re Corp.</ENAMEX>, up $2 to $37.75, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American International Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, up $3.25 to $102.625, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX>, up 87.5 cents to $62.50. Yesterday, the brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conning & Co.</ENAMEX> said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates, ending their long price wars.
Before this bullish theory surfaced, some insurance stocks initially fell, indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX>, which ended the day off 50 cents to $36.50, said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit.
On the prospect for rebuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern California</ENAMEX>, investors bid up cement-makers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calmat Co.</ENAMEX>, up $2.75 to $28.75, and Lone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>, up $1.75 to $29.25. Bridge and road builders had a field day, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kasler Corp.</ENAMEX>, up $2.125 to $9.875, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy F. Atkinson Co</ENAMEX>., up 87.5 to $61.875, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morrison Knudsen Corp.</ENAMEX>, which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday, up $2.25 to $44.125. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluor Corp.</ENAMEX>, a construction engineering firm, gained 75 cents to $33.375. But home-building stocks were a mixed bag.
Timber stocks got a big boost. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX>, up $1.25 to $58, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxxam Inc.</ENAMEX>, up $3 to $43.75, both reported strong profits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> touted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Willamette Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> as the best post-quake plywood plays.
Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> refineries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tosco Corp.</ENAMEX> jumped $1.125 to $20.125 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron Corp.</ENAMEX>, despite a temporary pipeline shutdown, rose $1 to $65.
Meanwhile, shares of some big housing lenders got hit, on the likelihood that the lenders' collateral -- people's homes -- suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wells Fargo & Co.</ENAMEX> fell 50 cents to $81.50, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankamerica Corp.</ENAMEX> fell 50 cents to $31.875. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> thrift stocks also fell, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden West Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.F. Ahmanson & Co.</ENAMEX>, which reported lower earnings yesterday.
``Property values didn't go up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> yesterday,'' says one money manager.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Gas & Electric Co.</ENAMEX> fell 37.5 cents to $19.625. One of its power generators was damaged, though the company said there won't be any financial impact.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Telesis Group</ENAMEX> lost 62.5 cents to $44.625. A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement, and some investors think it might have extra costs to repair damaged telephone lines.
Heavy construction, property-casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Equity Market Index yesterday.
