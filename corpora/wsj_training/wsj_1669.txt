After years of quarreling over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX>'s ``Ostpolitik'', <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> appear to have shifted onto a united course in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries, pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit. Both hope to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalinist</ENAMEX> holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and, to a lesser extent, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. West German officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>'s fledgling reform movement.
``The change taking place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> has aroused new hope in both German states that reforms will be undertaken in {<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>}, and that relations between the two German states, too, will get better,'' said Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans-Dietrich Genscher</ENAMEX>.
Addressing a conference of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for East</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Security Studies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genscher</ENAMEX> said, ``History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms.'' The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms, he said, is to create ``an equitable and stable peaceful order in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urals.</ENAMEX>''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Genscher</ENAMEX> and U.S. Secretary of Commerce <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Mosbacher</ENAMEX>, in separate speeches at the conference, appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> are leading supporters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s request for a $1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund.
``We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> to succeed. We are prepared to support those changes,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher</ENAMEX>. U.S. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to East bloc countries will remain in place, however.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. House</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Representatives</ENAMEX> yesterday approved an $837.5 million aid package for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> that more than doubles the amount President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had requested. The package was brought to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> just 15 days after it was introduced, indicating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s eagerness to reward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms.
The legislation, approved 345-47 and sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, establishes two enterprise funds, to be governed by independent nonprofit boards, which will make loans and investments in new business ventures in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>. The Polish fund would be seeded with $160 million, the Hungarian fund with $40 million.
In addition, a group of 24 industrialized countries, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and coordinated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX>, has promised <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to $1.11 billion through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Investment Bank</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> plans $222 million in direct aid.
When Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> travels to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> Nov. 9, he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks ($1.6 billion) in new credit guarantees for industrial projects. Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> agreed to reschedule 2.5 billion marks in Polish debt that came due last year. In addition, a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is to be written off. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign debt load of $39.2 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> also has increased its credit guarantees to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms, including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment. An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bavaria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baden</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wuerttemberg</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank AG</ENAMEX>, which last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, is now moving to become the first West German bank to set up independent business offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> as they shift to free-market economies. A maxim of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> banking holds that wherever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank</ENAMEX> goes, other West German banks follow. Indeed, at least four other West German banks are believed to be making inquiries.
