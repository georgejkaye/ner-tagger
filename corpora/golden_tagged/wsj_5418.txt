<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Solomon</ENAMEX> might have some tips for resolving this dispute.
In College Corner, a town of about 1,000 that straddles the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> border northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>, schoolchildren have gone to classes together for five generations. But now education officials from each state want control of their own.
``It's hard to run a school when there's continual conflict between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> laws,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin B. Walter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>'s superintendent of education. ``We've got different tenure laws, teacher retirement laws and tax laws.''
But many townspeople, used to watching their children grow up together, take a  less benign view. ``They want to draw a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> Wall down our town,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilee Mcdonough</ENAMEX>, mother of a second-grader and a preschooler. ``They're asking us to separate our kids and stamp them <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> kids. We're not going to allow it.''
College Corner already is split by two time zones and three counties, not to mention two states. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union School</ENAMEX>, now the town's elementary school after serving for 80 years as its only school, was built on the state line in 1893 as a symbol of the town's unity. The state line runs across the school's basketball court and through the superintendent's office. ``We've operated well for years,'' says superintendent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Crain</ENAMEX>, who sits at her desk in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> and answers the telephone in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>.
But this peaceful co-existence was shattered last spring when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Board of Education</ENAMEX> ruled that the state would no longer provide funding to the College Corner school district for students from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>. The reasoning: College Corner doesn't meet the state's definition of a school district because it only runs through the eighth grade. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union School</ENAMEX>'s graduates, including those from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, attend high school in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liberty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, six miles away.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> officials responded by arguing that they should take full control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union School</ENAMEX>, booting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> members from the joint school board and charging <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> students to attend.
But College Corner parents, savvy about life in two jurisdictions, sued in each state to block officials from acting. An <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> judge is pondering the crucial question of whether College Corner qualifies as a school district, while the town's students enter the new academic year attending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union School</ENAMEX> together.
