Concerning ``poor ol' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barney Frank</ENAMEX>'' (Sept. 1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politics & Policy)</ENAMEX>, this isn't about judgment or ethics, it's about criminal behavior on the part of our lawmakers.
By his own admission, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> is guilty of soliciting sex and committing sodomy with a prostitute, both crimes under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>'s code. He also hired his prostitute as an aide and allowed him to use his home, denying knowledge that it was used for prostitution. Considering how he met this person and for what purposes, belief in his denial requires a monumental leap of faith.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX>'s attempt to chalk this up to poor judgment or dumb luck just doesn't wash. This isn't an issue of judgment or ethics but of criminal conduct by a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Will we allow illegal acts by those charged with making our laws to receive nothing but a congressional slap on the wrist?
