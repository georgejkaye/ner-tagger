<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen Corp.</ENAMEX> said it filed suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron Corp.</ENAMEX> for halting a proposed merger valued at $320 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Simsbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>-based maker of electronic, industrial and defense products, also said it approved a restructuring plan. The plan could mean the sale of its electronic interconnections business segment, as well as certain other product lines.
A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX>, a closely held industrial electronics company, wouldn't comment on the suit. It was Vernitron that first approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> about a merger in December.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> agreed to the merger on April 30, and the accord was set to be signed by the end of this month. But last Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deer Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, pulled out, citing ``adverse changes'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> that it didn't anticipate.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> spokesman said the action by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> ``constituted a clear and willful breach of the agreement.
