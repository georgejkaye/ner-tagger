The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,003 registered voters conducted by the polling organizations of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Hart</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Teeter</ENAMEX> last Saturday through Tuesday.
The sample was drawn from 315 randomly selected geographic points in the continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. Households were selected by a method that gave all telephone numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance of being included. One registered voter, 18 years or older, was selected from each household by a procedure to provide the correct number of male and female respondents. The results of the survey were minimally weighted by age and religion to assure that the poll accurately reflects registered voters nationwide.
Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than three percentage points in either direction. The margin of error for subgroups would be larger.
