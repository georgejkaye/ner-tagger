<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monopolies and Mergers Commission</ENAMEX> Wednesday cleared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc S.A.</ENAMEX>'s purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX>, saying the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers.
The commission, which was asked to study the deal by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> after its announcement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">February</ENAMEX>, said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> would gain through the acquisition.
The French chemical giant would hold an 80% share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> market for salicylic acid, methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin.
The commission found that if the British government attempted to block the merger, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> would likely respond by closing the salicylates plant Monsanto operates in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wales</ENAMEX>, removing the matter from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> jurisdiction.
