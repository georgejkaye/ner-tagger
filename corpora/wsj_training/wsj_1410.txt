<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab-Scania AB</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX> broke off talks about a possible alliance after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials concluded that the cost to modernize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX>'s car operations would outweigh the likely return.
With the collapse of the talks Friday, European analysts expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX>, which is scrambling to fend off a hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s archrival, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX> said last week it ``has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers.'' Among the possible suitors is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S.p. A</ENAMEX>, analysts said last week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement Friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement ``that could make long-term business sense to both parties.''
Individuals close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> originally had seen a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> alliance as a way to expand its presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> luxury car markets. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations.
But the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently didn't go far. Some European analysts speculated that officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>'s highly profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scania</ENAMEX> truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials became convinced they couldn't expect to recover the investment it would require to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX>'s cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX>'s problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor ($186.1 million) loss during the first eight months of this year, slightly worse than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab-Scania</ENAMEX> had forecast in its first-half report last month. Overall, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab-Scania</ENAMEX>'s pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48.9% to 1 billion Swedish kronor ($155.1 million) from 1.96 billion kronor ($303.9 million) a year earlier.
Industry analysts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> said the most likely suitor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> now is Fiat. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> have worked together in the past, in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX>'s 9000 model, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Croma</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lancia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thema</ENAMEX>. Last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab-Scania</ENAMEX> Chief Executive Georg <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karnsund</ENAMEX> said his company has had talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat</ENAMEX> about a broader alliance. But the talks yielded ``nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it,'' he said.
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, analysts expect the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saab</ENAMEX> play will allow the U.S. auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> for a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>.
The failure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saab</ENAMEX> talks ``makes it even more crucial for {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>} to be victorious'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> contest, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Reitman</ENAMEX>, European auto industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBS-Phillips & Drew</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> faces an uphill fight for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>, however. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> wrapped up by the end of the month. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker's headquarter operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> spokesman said the visit isn't connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> situation.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> clearly views <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> as a prize worth fighting for, since the company's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> as a luxury import under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merkur</ENAMEX> brand name.
So despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> romance, analysts say Ford by last Friday had boosted its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> holding to about 11% of the luxury auto maker's shares outstanding from 10.4% early last week. About 5.4 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares changed hands in active trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s stock exchange Friday, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence ($11). On the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> over-the-counter market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents to $11.125.
