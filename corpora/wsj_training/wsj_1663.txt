<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> won overwhelming shareholder approval for a defensive restructuring to fend off a # 13.35 billion ($21.23 billion) takeover bid from Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>.
At a shareholders' meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, the tobacco, financial-services and retailing giant said it received 99.9% approval from voting holders for plans to spin off about $6 billion in assets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> aims to sell such U.S. retailing units as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and float its big paper and British retailing businesses via share issues to existing holders. Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10%, or about 153 million, of its shares and a 50% dividend increase.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> yesterday started its share buy-back. The company said it acquired 2.5 million shares for 785 pence ($12.48) each, or a total of # 19.6 million ($31.2 million), from its broker, Barclays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Zoete Wedd</ENAMEX>. The share buy-back plan is likely to underpin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s share price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> said it may make more equity purchases until the close of business today, depending on market conditions, but will cease further purchases until Nov. 22, when it releases third-quarter results.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares rose 29 pence to 783 pence on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s stock exchange yesterday.
Shareholder approval sets the stage for a lengthy process of restructuring that might not be completed until next year's second half. Before the recent tumult in global financial markets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> officials, holders and analysts had expected a substantial part of the restructuring to be complete by the end of the first half.
``We are not in any hurry to sell'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s other U.S. retail properties, said Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Sheehy</ENAMEX>. ``This isn't a distress sale. We are determined to get good prices.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Company</ENAMEX> officials say the flotations of the paper and British retailing businesses are likely only after the disposals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing assets.
Meanwhile, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> still is pursuing efforts to gain U.S. insurance regulators' approval for a change in control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> unit. The Anglo-French financier has indicated he intends to bid again for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> if he receives approval.
