<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments Inc.</ENAMEX> said it agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> to pursue large-scale manufacturing-automation projects within the electronics industry.
The arrangement is nothing new for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, which has entered into more than a dozen similar agreements to develop automation technology in the past six months. But it marks a major effort by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> to achieve a higher profile in so-called systems integration, an industry segment growing 20% a year, according to estimates from the consulting firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automation Research Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systems</ENAMEX> integration involves making automation systems from several manufacturers work together in one factory.
``We think it's a very good arrangement for both companies,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Chatha</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automation Research</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will gain increased market presence in an area where it has relatively limited experience, he explained, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> gets an opportunity to ``get out of the shadows'' and achieve recognition for its expertise in systems integration.
Under the arrangement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> becomes one of about 16 companies that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> keeps on file in an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> data bank it calls the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Solutions Center</ENAMEX>. The data bank acts as a high-tech dating service, matching customers' job requirements to participants' abilities, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Koenig</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s manager of systems-integration marketing for the industrial sector. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koenig</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX> has developed particularly strong automated systems for the plant floor.
The arrangement enables TI to meld its technical skills with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s marketing clout, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Vieira</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TI</ENAMEX>'s manager of marketing sales for manufacturing automation systems. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX> believes the arrangement will give it an advance look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s hardware developments, ``allowing us to be right on the leading edge all the time,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vieira</ENAMEX> said.
The potential payoff is significant. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chatha</ENAMEX>, the analyst, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market for systems-integration services totaled $2.8 billion last year and should grow to $6.4 billion by 1993. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> thus far has failed to be a significant player in this burgeoning market -- indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Automation Research</ENAMEX> ranks it 46th by sales in this area in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> -- but the company clearly intends to shake up the status quo.
