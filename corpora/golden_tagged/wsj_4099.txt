It's official: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> is a ``junk bond'' company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor's Corp.</ENAMEX> on Friday lowered its rating on the senior debt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>, formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX>, to double-B, a speculative or non-investment grade rating, from single-A-plus, an investment-grade rating. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> had lowered its rating on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> debt earlier last month. Debt issues that have below-investment-grade ratings are usually termed junk bonds.
In dropping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s credit rating, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> cited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s $14 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, which will add about $7.5 billion to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s debt load.
``The acquisition will dramatically reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s debt servicing capability, and coverage of preferred dividends is expected to be narrow,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heather Goodchild</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> vice president, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> is adding ``quite a large debt burden, and there are no immediate plans for major cost reductions through consolidations or very sizable asset sales'' that would reduce debt. ``When the rating is in the double-B category, the (interest) coverage is very thin. There isn't a lot of room for error,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodchild</ENAMEX> said.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> also lowered its ratings on the debt of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> affiliates as follows: subordinated debt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lorimar Telepictures</ENAMEX> unit to single-B-plus from single-A; commercial paper of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications</ENAMEX> to single-B from single-A-1; senior debt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Television & Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> to double-B from single-A-minus; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Television</ENAMEX>'s commercial paper to single-B from single-A2.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> said a total of about $1.5 billion in rated debt of the various companies was affected by downgradings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> also assigned a single-B-plus rating to two issues of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> preferred stock that shareholders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications</ENAMEX> will receive as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications.</ENAMEX> The two preferred issues have a total value of about $5.35 billion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> common shares fell 62.5 cents on Friday to close at $138.875 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> shares rose 25 cents to close at $65.125 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> composite trading. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> currently owns about 59% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and expects to buy the remainder by year's end.
