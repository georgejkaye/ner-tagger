The dollar was mixed after a relentless onslaught of central-bank intervention tugged the currency off intraday highs.
Foreign-exchange traders said the market was stunned by the numerous rounds of concerted intervention, which saw some central banks selling dollars at least five times during the day. A minimum of 12 central banks from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> sold dollars singly or in concert, following up on a harsh statement during the weekend from finance chiefs of the Group of Seven nations. G-7 nations include the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
The G-7 communique said the U.S. currency's strength was inconsistent with economic fundamentals. The statement, combined with aggressive coordinated intervention, triggered a five-pfennig slide in the dollar Monday.
Yesterday's sales knocked the dollar off its early Asian peaks of 1.9130 marks and 143.15 yen and dragged the U.S. currency to intraday lows of 1.8855 marks and 141.70 yen shortly before midday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
But losses that the yen and sterling chalked up against the mark buffered the dollar against those currencies. Free of further central-bank action in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> afternoon, the dollar recovered modestly to finish higher against the yen.
In late afternoon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading, the dollar was at 1.8938 marks, down from 1.8993 marks Monday, and at 142.40 yen, up from 142.13 yen. Sterling was at $1.6180, up from $1.6170.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Wednesday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at 141.60 yen, down from Tuesday's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of 142.80 yen.
Traders said Tuesday that the central banks seemed to rely on the frequency of intervention rather than size, with estimates of a modest $1.3 billion total belying the associated fanfare. By comparison, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> has been reported to sell $2 billion on its own in one day's intervention.
Shortly after the start of Asian trading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> began to intervene, joined later by the West German <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> as Asian trading crossed into the European day.
Later, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western European</ENAMEX> trading, the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian, Spanish, Dutch and Belgian central banks joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> in at least three rounds of coordinated intervention and individual forays. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Canada</ENAMEX> joined the melee after U.S. dealings got under way.
Despite the lull in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> afternoon, dealers say the central banks will renew their pressure on the dollar today. Several traders said monetary authorities appear determined to force the dollar solidly under the top of the old G-7 Louvre trading range, believed to be at 1.90 marks and 140 yen.
Prolonged weakness in the dollar will likely benefit the mark, traders said, because longer-term investors prize that currency's stability.
The mark's attractiveness will multiply if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> decides to raise key interest rates. Higher domestic interest rates usually bolster the national currency by drawing money to interest-bearing investments denominated in that currency.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>'s central-bank council will meet on Oct. 5, and speculation has intensified that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> won't delay an expected rate increase any more.
If central banks intend to lower the dollar for an extended period -- and this appears to be their goal -- the most effective option open to them is a realignment of interest rates, traders said. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> appears likely to defer a rate boost until after a national election is called in the wake of scandal involving the ruling party, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> will want to wait until scattered signs of potential inflation fade in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy, analysts said.
On <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX>, gold for current delivery settled at $368.50 an ounce, down $1.30. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Wednesday, gold was quoted at $368.20 an ounce.
