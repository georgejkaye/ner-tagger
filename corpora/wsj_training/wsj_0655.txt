Nicaraguan President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed to do: revive a constituency for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> rebels.
Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX>, and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> parried the question at a news conference here Saturday, saying only that ``if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>) said yesterday on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC-TV</ENAMEX>'s ``Meet the Press'' that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s threat was ``a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it.''
The threat came during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica to highlight <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central America</ENAMEX>'s progress toward democracy in the region, attended by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, Canadian Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> and 14 other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Hemisphere</ENAMEX> leaders. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> Saturday night.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> announced on Friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army. Saturday, he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> ends its financial support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX>. He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels.
Not only did Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region, it came as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections. Outside observers are gathering in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates. And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March.
The humanitarian assistance, which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honduras</ENAMEX>, replaced the military aid cut off by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in February 1988. While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Minority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>) said yesterday on ``Meet the Press'': ``I would hope after his {Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s} act yesterday or the day before, we'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid.'' Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader.
While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question, rejected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and de-emphasized by the Bush administration, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue.
``The administration should now state that if the {February} election is voided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX>... they should call for military aid,'' said former Assistant Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott Abrams</ENAMEX>. ``In these circumstances, I think they'd win.''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> said that congressional Democrats intend to honor the March agreement to give non-lethal support to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> through the February elections, although he added that the agreement requires that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> not initiate any military action.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> have at times violated it themselves. Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX>, who accompanied President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to Costa Rica, told reporters Friday: ``I have no reason to deny reports that some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> ambushed some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> soldiers.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s assistant for inter-American affairs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Aronson</ENAMEX>, while maintaining that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinistas</ENAMEX> had also broken the cease-fire, acknowledged: ``It's never very clear who starts what.'' He added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire.
In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> officials traveling with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>'s wavering as a sign that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abrams</ENAMEX> said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> is seeking to demobilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections.
``My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning'' by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency, he said.
