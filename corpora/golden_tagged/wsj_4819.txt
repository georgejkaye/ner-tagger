Maybe we need a Parkinson's Law for arms-control proposals: A proposal's likelihood of enhancing national security or world peace is inversely related to the size of its press converage.
Exhibit A would be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg-Briand</ENAMEX> Pact of 1928, in which 54 signatory nations outlawed war as a means of settling disputes. We have similar doubts about President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s proposal at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> yesterday to ban chemical weapons. Over the weekend, the Soviet foreign minister received prominent attention for agreeing to commence START negotiations -- on the understanding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Defense Initiative</ENAMEX> would never be deployed. Finally, supporting the law's thesis, less publicized news stories noted last week that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> had tabled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> a comprehensive plan to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>'s and the Warsaw Pact's conventional forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> -- potentially one of the most militarily significant rearrangements in postwar <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> promised to eliminate 100% of the U.S. chemical arsenal within 10 years once all nations ``capable of building'' such weapons sign the treaty. Laying aside what ``capable of building'' may mean, verification of such a ban is not possible. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, for instance, has many millions of square miles. Nor does the community of nations Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> addressed yesterday have means for dealing with accused chemical-arms violators who often tell them to get lost, as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> did after bombing his Kurdish minority with chemicals.
Moreover, when it has been well established that such a hopeful treaty can be neither verified nor enforced, past practice has been to assert that apparent violations are in fact not violations, as when arms-control enthusiasts argued several years ago that breaches in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laos</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biological Weapons</ENAMEX> Convention were fecal bombardments by giant yellow bees. In this setting, the most likely scenario is that many nations will in fact retain a chemical-weapons inventory to deter their less civilized adversaries. The more immediate danger in the sort of publicized effort Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> made at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> is that it becomes difficult to conduct serious business around more important matters.
The Soviets' weekend proposal on strategic arms, for instance, is as much as anything an exercise in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> politics, a trademark of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> era. The Soviets let it be known that they'd no longer let strategic defense stand in the way of signing a START accord -- but that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> later decided to deploy SDI, the Soviets would abrogate START. This is the sort of concession that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Capone</ENAMEX> made famous.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> understands that elements in the U.S. Congress want to kill SDI; perhaps he has decided to let them do his negotiating for him. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Aspin</ENAMEX>, the hapless zookeeper of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX>, acknowledged the mood of his colleagues on Sunday by attacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> for not having used SDI as a ``bargaining chip.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesley Stahl</ENAMEX>, playing devil's advocate, noted that perhaps the administration really does want SDI. So what? replied Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aspin</ENAMEX>; in the wake of this Soviet proposal, ``they won't get it anyway.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> also understands, alas much better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, that nuclear arms control is a good way to hamstring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s competitive advantage in high technology. The 1972 ABM Treaty prevented research on nuclear defenses for a decade, until SDI research confronted the Soviets with a technological race they couldn't win. With START, as the Soviets now describe it, he can achieve the same result, guaranteeing the Soviet nuclear threat another 20 years.
Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> continues to insist that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> still wants SDI, but how much? A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference is debating House provisions that would fund strategic defense at levels so low (below $4 billion) that they'd effectively gut any practical SDI. Failure to veto such a bill would come very close to adopting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s position.
It would be a pity if the truly substantive conventional arms talks became hostage to the desire to complete a chemical-weapons or START agreement prior to the 1992 election. Over all the years of Warsaw Pact force-level superiority, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> didn't back down or break. This resolve, enhanced by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s commitment to construct anti-missile defense systems, is the political strategy that brought the current Soviet leadership to the bargaining table.
We suppose there might be something perversely appropriate in issuing a call for a chemical-weapons ban to an institution such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>. But if there is a serious effort to be made in controlling arms, it belongs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> talks over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>'s tank armies. Bagging that trophy would be a huge achievement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> presidency.
