<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> State Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Kahn</ENAMEX> believes society often ignores the needs of children because they lack real political power. So she has introduced a bill to grant the vote in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> to anyone 12 years of age or older. When her idea was met with peals of laughter Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX> said her critics displayed an ``adult supremacy attitude.'' It's more likely they fear a new political bidding war in which pork barrel projects are passed to attract votes from this new constituency. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> stamps, anyone?
