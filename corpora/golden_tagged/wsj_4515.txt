<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks retreated for the first time in five trading days Wednesday, with share prices pressured by profit-taking after Tuesday's record high. Prices also dropped in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>.
Morning trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> was relatively active, reflecting momentum improved by Tuesday's gains. The market failed to maintain energy in the afternoon, however, because of a lack of participation by institutional investors, traders said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index fell 74.25 points to 35370.57. The index gained 484.11 points Tuesday. First section volume was estimated at 1 billion shares, up from 970 million Tuesday. The last time the trading volume was a billion shares was July 27. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stock price index of all issues listed in the first section was up 6.44 points to 2681.66.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Thursday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index rose 128.26 points to 35498.83.
Traders and fund managers agreed the gains made Tuesday owed much to sales effort by securities firms. As Tuesday was the first trading day for October transactions, securities firms, which suffered through a sluggish summer, were said to have tried hard to push up sales to start the latter half of the fiscal year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shin Tokoi</ENAMEX>, deputy general manager of Japanese equities at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Natwest Securities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, said investors were suspicious about whether the market would continue to advance as rapidly as Tuesday.
These investors didn't change their cautious attitudes toward the market and avoided committing long term to any issues, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tokoi</ENAMEX> said. Their main concern for the time being is to continue profit-taking and retreating quickly rather than buying issues in expectation for future advances, he said.
Wednesday's main losers were highpriced issues, which made strong gains Tuesday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, which advanced 410 yen Tuesday, ended at 8,590 yen ($60.32), down 220 yen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanuc</ENAMEX>, a 500-yen gainer the previous day, lost 50 to 7,950. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX> gave up 140 to 5,750. Pioneer Electronic was down 70 at 5,300.
Electric utilities fell on profit-taking, traders said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansai Electric Power</ENAMEX> was down 130 to 4,510. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo Electric Power</ENAMEX> went down 30 to 5,890.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London</ENAMEX> shares closed slightly lower on continued nervousness over the direction of U.K. interest rates and corporate profitability.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 100-share index, the most closely watched measure of the market, finished down 4.9 points at 2331.2. The index, however, staged a modest recovery in late dealings after it opened weaker at 2329.8 and slipped as much as 14.4 points by early afternoon.
The 30-share index settled 6.1 points lower at 1907.4. Volume was only 428.9 million shares traded, down from 450.8 million Tuesday.
Even with the modest rebound before the close, dealers said the market remains under pressure from Tuesday's report showing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s third-worst current account and merchandise trade deficits. The deficits have focused attention on the prospects for an interest rate increase in the coming weeks.
``The market consolidated a bit  today,'' a dealer with a large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> brokerage firm said. ``There's a lot of negative talk going around... but it can't be a straight line down.''
Composite insurers firmed, which dealers linked to expectations that damage claims arising from Hurricane Hugo won't be as bad as expected.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accident</ENAMEX>, which was the first U.K. composite insurer to disclose its estimated losses from the hurricane, settled up # 1 at # 10.96. It said that losses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> could total # 60 million.
Frankfurt prices fell across the board amid continued rumors the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> will call for an emergency meeting Thursday to raise interest rates.
Earlier in the day, a central bank spokesman denied the rumor, which had unsettled some financial markets in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAX</ENAMEX> index dropped 17.38 points to 1591.65.
Traders said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>-meeting rumor, which originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, had been instrumental in making many investors nervous and caused a sell-off in German equities. While speculation about an imminent rise in German interest rates has been making the rounds for days, it intensified this week, sending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAX</ENAMEX> index into a tailspin Tuesday that cost it 2.8% by the end of Wednesday's session.
Traders said the market seems overloaded with speculative money and is likely to continue shedding for some time the gains it made earlier this month.
Few market participants however, predict doom and gloom for the coming quarter. Many say once the rate increase -- seen by some as a given -- is in place, the market will resume its march upward.
Until then, blue-chip and second-tier stocks are going to suffer from profit-taking, and only special situations are expected to advance. Wednesday, the retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horten</ENAMEX> was among the latter, helped by the announcement Tuesday that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries</ENAMEX> intends to sell its 51% stake in the German retailer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horten</ENAMEX> shares went up 5.5 marks to 322.5 marks ($171).
Other retailers were mixed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufhof</ENAMEX> lost 3 to 572, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karstadt</ENAMEX> gained 4 to 682.
Elsewhere, prices closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stockholm</ENAMEX>, lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan</ENAMEX>, and mixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>.
Zurich prices tumbled in moderately active trading as jitters about domestic interest rates and the bleak mood on other European stock markets prompted widespread selling, brokers said. One broker said the negative sentiment affected all sectors, although industrials, chemicals, food shares and machinery stocks were hardest hit.
Among Asian and Pacific markets, shares closed lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>, were mixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> and higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellington</ENAMEX>.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.
