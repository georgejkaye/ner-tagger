<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariel Clemensen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> to be the head of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>'s new junk-bond unit.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clemensen</ENAMEX>, age 37, manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX>'s junk-bond research department since 1985, has gained prominence for her willingness to describe conditions in the junk-bond market frankly during its periodic bouts of weakness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>, like other banks, received the green light earlier this year from federal bank regulators to underwrite corporate bond issues, including speculative-grade junk bonds. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Lawrence</ENAMEX>, head of its high-yield department, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> needed a research capability ``to get ready for the public market, to support the sales and trading.''
The bank holding company has yet to underwrite its first public junk-bond issue. But it has made 12 temporary bridge loans totaling $1.1 billion in the past year to help clients complete takeovers. And it has sold several high-yield bond issues privately.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clemensen</ENAMEX> joins a group of about 20 high-yield professionals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp Securities Markets Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>'s broker-dealer. Half of them are salespeople and traders and the remainder are investment bankers seeking deals. She came to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX> in 1983 as a utility bond analyst after 11 years at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Group</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> money manager.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>, she said, ``I'm supposed to try to provide the investor viewpoint to the bank's new underwriting powers in creating and selling high-yield securities.
