<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor Inc.</ENAMEX> asked for federal marketing clearance of its drug to treat septic shock, marking another step along a closely watched race in biotechnology.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> requesting approval to sell the drug, a monoclonal antibody that has been tested in the treatment of the often fatal shock due to infection by gram negative bacteria. The filing follows by about six months a similar one from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, company that like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> specializes in monoclonal antibodies.
Until this week, it had been almost a foregone conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma</ENAMEX> would beat Centocor to market by several months, if the two companies get the go-ahead from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>. But after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> filing some analysts speculated that the race could get closer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> itself had indicated that it would do enough clinical trials to ask for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval by year end. But until yesterday some analysts had doubted that projection, since the company had missed some of its own deadlines before.
``Now the question is,'Which will come out first?''' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kupor</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX>
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> stock rose $2.25 to close at $22.25. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma</ENAMEX> closed at $20, down 50 cents.
The competition between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma</ENAMEX> reflects a new phase in the use of monoclonal antibodies, which until now has been mostly limited to diagnosis rather than therapy. Monoclonal antibodies are like the antibodies the body produces to fend off disease but are selected and produced by laboratory techniques to zoom in on chosen targets.
Gram negative bacteria can get into the blood as a result of wounds, burns and surgery, among other routes. The bacteria produce poisons called endotoxins, which can cause septic shock and death. Unlike antibiotics, which target the bacteria and are the routine treatment today, monoclonal antibodies are meant to neutralize the endotoxins.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Sprung</ENAMEX>, chief of critical care medicine at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Administration Medical Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, said estimates of annual cases of this type of infection in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> hospitals range from 100,000 to 300,000. Mortality rates have ranged from 20% to 75%, he said, depending on the types of patient groups studied. If monoclonal antibodies fulfill their promise, ``this could revolutionize the way we treat patients with these infections,'' he said.
Some analysts project the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market for these antibodies could grow to between $200 million and $400 million by the early 1990s. They say a single course of treatment is likely to cost $1,500 or more.
The filing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> led some analysts to surmise that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> might slow its consideration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma</ENAMEX> filing so as to compare them. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centoxin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> product, is a human antibody, whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xomen-E5</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma</ENAMEX> product, is a mouse antibody. Whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centocor</ENAMEX> product will have a clear-cut clinical advantage has still to be resolved.
In any case, Wall Street generally isn't looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approval of either product before mid-1990. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma</ENAMEX> product is still expected to be backed by a larger sales force, since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma</ENAMEX> has reached a marketing pact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer Inc.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical company.
