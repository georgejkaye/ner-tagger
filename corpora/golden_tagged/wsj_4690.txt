<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE Airfone Inc.</ENAMEX>, citing confusion among some airline passengers about prices, said it will restructure its rates, effective Sunday.
Air-to-ground telephone users now pay $7.50 for the first three minutes and $1.25 for each additional minute. Under the new rates, each call will cost $2 for a connection fee and $2 for each minute. This means a rate cut for short calls, but an increase for calls of three minutes or longer. For example, a two-minute call will decline to $6 from $7.50, while a three-minute conversation will rise to $8.
A spokesman for the unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stamford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, telecommunications, lighting and precision-materials company, said, ``We're looking for this new rate structure to allow more people to use the service.'' The current rates, he explained, had left ``misimpressions'' of higher prices for making calls, especially among leisure travelers.
A spokesman at one airline said its passengers' Airfone calls typically last three to five minutes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airfone</ENAMEX> is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE Mobile Communications Group</ENAMEX> and doesn't break out operating profit or revenue.
