<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Products Inc.</ENAMEX> posted a third-quarter profit of $34.6 million, reversing a year-earlier loss.
The cosmetics, jewelry and gift products concern had per-share earnings of 46 cents in the latest quarter. A year earlier, it reported a loss of $405.9 million, or $7.78 a share, due to a one-time $425 million charge for discontinued operations.
Sales rose 8% to $785.1 million from $725.6 million.
Avon said sales in the direct-selling division dropped 2% as sales of new products, especially gift and jewelry lines, were below expectations. The weak sales are expected to continue into the fourth quarter, Avon added.
``Third-quarter net was on target with expectations,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Shore</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> But the third quarter isn't the problem, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shore</ENAMEX> added. ``It's the fourth quarter and what might linger beyond that.''
Last month, Avon executives indicated that the company would experience a $75 million to $90 million revenue shortage due to weakness in its gift and decorative lines.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon</ENAMEX> closed at $26.875, down 87.5 cents.
The company's retail prestige fragrance division, which includes Giorgio <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parfums Stern</ENAMEX>, posted 35% higher sales. Earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon</ENAMEX> said it agreed to sell its Valentino fragrance business and the inventory of its Parfums Stern unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valentino Group</ENAMEX> for about $12.3 million in cash and notes.
