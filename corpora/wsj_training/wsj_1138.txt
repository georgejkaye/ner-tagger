The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> has distributed these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting RICO cases. A related editorial appears today.
Under {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICO</ENAMEX>}, the government may seek a temporary restraining order (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TRO</ENAMEX>) upon the filing of a RICO indictment, in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered. Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants, including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependents, and others. Some highly publicized cases involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICO Tros</ENAMEX> have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process. In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal Division</ENAMEX> has instituted the following requirements to control the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tros</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">RICO</ENAMEX> prosecutions. (It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asset Forfeiture Office.</ENAMEX>):
1. As part of the approval process for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICO</ENAMEX> prosecutions, the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRO</ENAMEX> for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section. The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies (such as bonds) are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction.
2. In seeking approval of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TRO</ENAMEX>, the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRO</ENAMEX> would have on innocent third parties, balanced against the government's need to preserve the assets.
3. In deciding whether forfeiture (and, hence, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TRO</ENAMEX>) is appropriate, the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense; the government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime.
4. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICO TRO</ENAMEX> is being sought, the prosecutor is required, at the earliest appropriate time, to state publicly that the government's request for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TRO</ENAMEX>, and eventual forfeiture, is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is, in requesting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TRO</ENAMEX>, the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties; and will, in all other respects, assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected, through proceeding under {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RICO</ENAMEX>} and otherwise.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX> expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or, at the latest, at the first proceeding before the court concerning the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TRO</ENAMEX>.
