In what could be a landmark decision for hostile international acquisitions, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s Takeover Panel gave Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> more time to pursue its unfriendly # 13.4 billion (US$20.8 billion) quest for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based tobacco, financial services, retailing and paper giant, said it would appeal the decision.
With the current bid obviously doomed because of regulatory delays in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the Takeover Panel permitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> to drop the bid and launch a new offer within 21 days of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>'s getting final approval by U.S. insurance commissioners.
It is expected that it will be several weeks before any new bid will be made. Should it come, it will include a cash portion, in contrast to the highly leveraged, all-paper current bid, persons in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> camp have indicated. The current bid ranks second to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX>'s $25 billion takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Inc.</ENAMEX> as the largest acquisition attempt in corporate history.
For the international investment community, a major issue was whether the panel could be flexible enough to dovetail its strict timetable for takeovers with foreign regulatory processes, which often exceed the timetable. The flip side of the issue was whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British</ENAMEX>-based target company could successfully hide behind a time shield created by lengthy foreign regulatory requirements.
In a 24-page decision released in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> on Friday, the panel said that although the fight for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> is a ``novel'' situation, ``situations of this kind,'' where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s takeover code and foreign regulatory processes must be considered, ``are likely to recur.'' It added that the code should demonstrate that ``it can adapt to new situations. Foreign regulatory intervention is clearly one such situation.''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, investment bankers unconnected with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>\ battle welcomed the decision. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National boundaries</ENAMEX> are a cliche,'' asserted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald M. Freeman</ENAMEX>, head of European investment banking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> ``The market simply doesn't respect them.''
Added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rory Macnamara</ENAMEX>, a corporate finance director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Grenfell & Co.</ENAMEX>: ``Clearly the decision limits the foreign frustrating defenses that might have been used by some companies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares jumped 18 pence Friday to close at 819 pence. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, the company's American depository receipts rose to $12.75, up 37.5 cents.
The immediate issue before the Takeover Panel involved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> insurance unit, the 15th largest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Insurance</ENAMEX> commissioners in the nine states where <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based Farmers operates must approve any change in ownership in the company.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> now faces a long uphill battle with the regulators. By every account, he and his associates -- including financiers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Rothschild</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kerry</ENAMEX> Packer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> -- haven't done much to ingratiate themselves. Particularly irritating to the regulators were federal lawsuits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> filed seeking, on constitutional grounds, to keep the regulators from reviewing the bid.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> was dealt another blow in that legal attempt Friday, when a federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX> became the fourth to deny his request for a preliminary injunction to block a state insurance director from reviewing the bid.
Reached by telephone in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> yesterday, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> may soon drop the lawsuits. He said: ``My position has always been to negotiate in a constructive and friendly way with the commissioners to transfer the ownership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers.</ENAMEX>''
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> ``can spend a year or more playing with the regulators,'' said an attorney for one of the state insurance commissions. ``If we do get to do our review and we deny the bid, they'll appeal.''
Regulators also have been put off by the several shifts in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>'s strategy. First it suggested it would put Farmers into a trust pending a sale, then it sued the regulators, then it introduced former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E. Simon</ENAMEX> as a potential buyer for Farmers, and finally it struck a deal to sell the insurer to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi Assurances</ENAMEX> for $4.5 billion after the acquisition.
``Generally, when people want to move from Point A to Point B, they draft a plan to get there,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore R. Kulongoski</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Director of Insurance and Finance.</ENAMEX> ``But this is the only time I've seen where every 500 yards they stop, reconnoiter the area, then decide how they'll proceed for the the next 500 yards. I just think from the very beginning there's been no long-term strategy developed for this procedure.''
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> disagrees. ``I can understand that when anything changes, it puzzles,'' he said in the interview yesterday. ``But we've made it clear from day one that we didn't want to be in insurance.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>'s plan is to sell all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> operations save tobacco.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kulongoski</ENAMEX> said he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> has mistakenly perceived the regulatory procedure as a political battle that can be won or lost on appearances. ``The Europeans don't know quite what to make of the American regulatory process. They think it's a P.R. battle. They hire P.R. firms to send out hundreds of releases, and to initiate these letter-writing campaigns. But I think they're wrong.''
Indeed, the Takeover Panel noted that both sides' U.S. efforts have been ``massive and intense.'' It said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> has deployed more than 110 full-time lawyers, lobbyists and public-relations personnel, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s ``battalions'' include 21 law, 15 lobbying and 12 public-relations firms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi</ENAMEX> has been doing its part to win over the regulators. Chairman and Chief Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Bebear</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> Friday to tell <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> regulators why his company would be a better parent for Farmers than B.A.T. The stop was the last in a tour that brought Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>.
``I explained to them who we are, that we're an insurance company, not a raider, and that we have this joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Goldsmith</ENAMEX>,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bebear</ENAMEX> in an interview. ``We're trying to invest for a long time. We want to keep the Farmers management team, the employees, the agents. When you buy a company that is very well run, it would be stupid to change things. When we explained that to the commissioners, they seemed more comfortable.''
At least some explanation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axa-Midi</ENAMEX> was needed, since most of the documents it submitted to the regulators were in French. ``I don't think I'll be reading it. I don't remember much of my French from high school,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pamela Scott</ENAMEX>, chief counsel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> insurance department. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Axa-Midi</ENAMEX> says it is in the process of getting the documents translated into English.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, saying he was relieved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> had been saved from ``a time guillotine'' by the Takeover Panel, added that he would be ``happy and delighted to visit'' with regulators ``if they wish to see me.'' On his current U.S. visit, he is expected to meet with members of the media and seek meetings with political leaders in a bid to alter his corporate-raider image.
The wrangling about Farmers made it obvious in recent days that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> wasn't going to meet a Takeover Panel requirement that, among other things, the bid had to clear all regulatory hurdles by Oct. 7, or 60 days after the bid had been filed. The panel said it gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> more time because otherwise shareholders wouldn't have had ``a real opportunity to consider an offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> on its merits.''
The panel laid down three conditions: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">That Hoylake</ENAMEX> dissolve its current bid as quickly as possible, that it use ``its best efforts'' to conclude the regulatory processes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and that it refrain from direct or indirect acquisition of any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares until announcement of a new offer.
