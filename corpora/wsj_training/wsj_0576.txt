Well, the arrogant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> media have spoken again (``Going for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Green</ENAMEX>,'' editorial, Oct. 17). Having resided in the great state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> for the past seven years, I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing.
Perhaps it's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists, suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are ``whacky'' and referring to so many citizens as ``la-la activists.'' Strange that we don't hear similar criticisms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> activists who seek to clean up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> Harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste.
While there are no easy low-cost solutions, simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state, the nation and the world. If nothing else, such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action.
Before your next <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>-bashing editorial, please spend more time out here witnessing the situation -- it just may change your view.

I realize you were just looking for something snotty to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> and its environmental movement, but picking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd Wright</ENAMEX> to say it for you was a bad call. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>'s organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among ``la-la activists.'' Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature. Obviously, it's lost on you that about 75% of the American people these days (and in fact the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>) consider themselves environmentalists.
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> being a state run by liberal environmental loonies, let's not forget where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> came from. Perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees, is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth. But it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lloyd</ENAMEX> Wright who said, ``Is this not Anti-Christ? The Moloch that knows no God but more?''

Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers' comments in letters to the editor, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alar</ENAMEX>: Scaring on the Side of Caution.'' The illogic and inaccuracy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John H. Adams</ENAMEX>'s comments for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Resources Defense Council</ENAMEX> fully justifies your characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greens</ENAMEX> in particular as ``la-la activists.'' We may all hope that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university's renowned Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Jukes</ENAMEX> provides them and ignore the charlatanry profferred by their ``wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> weepers.''
I have a different approach to offer, not only to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Californians</ENAMEX>, but to all Americans. In a free country, the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good manners and public safety. Would-be naysayers should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law.

The 170 airlines in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Air Transport Association</ENAMEX> last year posted group net profit of $2.5 billion on revenue of $125.1 billion.
According to the association's annual report, scheduled to be released today in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IATA</ENAMEX> members haven't posted such a strong performance since the late 1970s. Revenue last year increased by more than 11% over 1988, and net income nearly tripled from restated year-earlier net of $900 million.
The group attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate, rising demand for air travel and improved average yield (revenue received per ton of traffic transported a kilometer). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Systemwide</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IATA</ENAMEX> airlines carried 632 million passengers last year, 2% more than in 1987. But passenger-kilometers, the distance flown while carrying people, increased 5.3% in 1988.
The association said that lack of airport and air space capacity is the biggest problem facing the airline industry.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX> has abolished a unit known for persecuting dissidents, the government newspaper Izvestia said. The newspaper quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir A. Kryuchkov</ENAMEX> as saying the definition of anti-Soviet crimes had narrowed, the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a simple slip of the tongue. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kryuchkov</ENAMEX> was quoted as saying that in place of the infamous 5th Directorate a new unit would work ``to foil the conspiracies of foreign intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of ``massive buying out of food'' by tourists from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, the Rude Pravo daily said. Rising inflation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovak</ENAMEX> food, clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these countries. The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s biggest union, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IG Metall</ENAMEX>, said it is ready to back demands for more pay and shorter hours with strikes against the nation's automotive, steel and engineering industries. Its chairman told the union to prepare for the worst in next year's confrontation with employers over a new three-year wage deal. A major goal is to cut the working week to 35 hours from the present 37.
Last week came news of alarm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venice</ENAMEX> over a plan to tap gas fields off the city's coast. Now comes word from a scientist that over the next century <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venice</ENAMEX> will sink nearly three times faster than the present rate because of the ``greenhouse effect.'' ``Global warming means higher tides which will lower Venice by another 23 inches in the next 100 years,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giovanni Cecconi</ENAMEX> of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Venice Consortium</ENAMEX> said. The consortium of scientists and companies was set up by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> to help preserve the fabled city of canals. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Venice</ENAMEX> has sunk 10 inches in this century.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quelle</ENAMEX> said it will establish a mail-order operation with two local partners in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> next year. Saying this is a first for a Western company, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s largest mail-order group said the newly established <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intermoda company</ENAMEX> is scheduled to begin operations in February 1990. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intermoda</ENAMEX> will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quelle</ENAMEX> catalog, translated into Russian, to Soviet customers who have access to convertible currency.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean small-screen color-television sets.
Saying that a surge in low-priced imports had damaged EC producers' profits and led to job losses, the commission imposed a duty of 10.2% on Tvs made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daewoo</ENAMEX>, a duty of 12.3% on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldstar Co.</ENAMEX>, 13% on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samsung</ENAMEX> and 19.6% on Tvs made by other South Korean producers.
The commission said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> television producers lost ``important market shares'' and suffered an ``unsustainable'' pressure on prices because of the Korean companies' marketing and pricing policies, which it said were ``in clear violation'' of international trade rules.
In other news concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>'s television industry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samsung</ENAMEX> signed an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soyuz</ENAMEX>, the external-trade organization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, to swap Korean television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier this year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sri Lanka</ENAMEX>, where more than 15,000 people have died in six years of ethnic turmoil, said it will ban sex and violence from state-owned television next year. ``Many programs we have now come from the West and are not suitable to our culture,'' a government minister said. A star attraction on the national network is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dynasty</ENAMEX>.''... A poll of [<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Koreans</ENAMEX>]     showed overwhelming opposition to efforts to curb dog-meat consumption just because it offends foreigners.
