The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> has brought a disciplinary action against a firm headed by its former chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian P. Monieson</ENAMEX>. The Merc charges failure to supervise two commodity brokers who allegedly defrauded customers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX>'s action, which doesn't name the influential Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monieson</ENAMEX>, closely parallels charges brought a year ago by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>, which did name Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monieson</ENAMEX> as a defendant, has asked that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monieson</ENAMEX> and his firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP Commodities Inc.</ENAMEX>, essentially be banned from trading.
A hearing on the more recent Merc charges has been put off until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> case is resolved, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monieson</ENAMEX> confirmed in an interview. He denied any wrongdoing in the matter. ``We felt we acted with integrity,'' he said. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> hearing is set to begin Nov. 6.
Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> allege that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> failed to supervise the activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman K. Furlett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira P. Greenspon</ENAMEX>, two non-employee brokers who were affiliated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> until 1987. In scores of instances, the brokers allegedly stuck customers with losing trades and kept winners for themselves. They did this, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> and Merc charge, by submitting trades to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX>'s floor brokers without the required customer-account number -- waiting to see how the trade turned out to decide who to give it to. The practice is known as ``allocating trades.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Koch</ENAMEX>, a lawyer for the two men, said: ``They vigorously deny any and all allegations.''
Earlier this week, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspon</ENAMEX> settled charges brought by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Futures Association</ENAMEX>, an industry group that handles some regulation of brokers, that he had an associate take a licensing test for him in 1975. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspon</ENAMEX>, while neither admitting nor denying the charge, agreed to leave the futures business for 10 years.
This charge and the trade-allocating charges were prompted by complaints from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Fiore</ENAMEX>, a former office manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greenspon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furlett</ENAMEX>. She claimed in an April 1986 letter to the Merc that she was fired by the men ``because I refused to take part in their illegal trading practices.'' In another letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NFA</ENAMEX>, she claimed: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> also churn these accounts on a daily basis and laugh at the fact that even if the customers lose they {<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman}</ENAMEX> still make the commission on all of the trades.''
After leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> in 1987, the two brokers became affiliated with another firm run by another former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. ``Jack'' Sandner</ENAMEX>. His firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rufenacht</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bromagen & Hertz Inc.</ENAMEX>, allowed the two brokers to solicit trades using the firm's name.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> said in an interview that he had no idea the two men had been accused of fraudulent trading when they became affiliated with his firm and that he severed the relationship with them after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> charges were made a year ago. He added that his firm didn't receive any complaints about the two brokers.
A compliance official at Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s firm did sign registration forms for the two men that indicated they faced some kind of charges. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> said he was never made aware of this. He added that he also never knew about the Merc case against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX> and the brokers because even as chairman he stayed out of disciplinary cases.
As reported, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX>'s firm employed some former salesmen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Commodity Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> while the salesmen were under federal investigation for alleged fraud. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandner</ENAMEX> said he now regrets not checking more thoroughly into the backgrounds of brokers doing business with his firm.
Meanwhile, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> case against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monieson</ENAMEX>, the agency charges that he ``was put on notice by at least five different GNP employees that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furlett</ENAMEX>, and later <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Furlett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenspon</ENAMEX>, were engaging in suspicious trading activity or were actually defrauding customers.'' The agency says he didn't move promptly to stop the alleged activity.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> is asking administrative law judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H. Painter</ENAMEX> to suspend or revoke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GNP</ENAMEX>'s registration that allows it to clear futures trades, to suspend or  revoke Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monieson</ENAMEX>'s registration as a floor broker, and to assess fines. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monieson</ENAMEX> and GNP are expected to vigorously contest the charges. Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Furlett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenspon</ENAMEX> are expected to voluntarily leave the industry.
