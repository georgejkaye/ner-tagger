<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors Co.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William K. Coors</ENAMEX>, chairman, assumed the additional responsibilities of president, succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey H. Coors</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Coors</ENAMEX>, 44 years old, had been president since 1985, when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job. But the brewer said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Coors</ENAMEX> voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors Technology Co.</ENAMEX>, a small unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> he has run for several years.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company doesn't believe the move will further increase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Coors</ENAMEX>'s influence or reduce the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Coors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Coors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Coors Jr.</ENAMEX>, who run the company's three operating units.
``It certainly wasn't intended to be a demotion,'' the spokesman said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Jr.</ENAMEX> have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work. We don't think this will affect that.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Jr</ENAMEX>. are brothers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Coors</ENAMEX> is their uncle. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Sr</ENAMEX>. constitute the company's board.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Coors</ENAMEX> runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> unit, the nation's fourth-largest brewery that accounted for $1.24 billion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors</ENAMEX>'s $1.52 billion in 1988 sales. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Jr.</ENAMEX> runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors Ceramics Co.</ENAMEX>, the other operating unit, which had about $150 million in 1988 sales.
