Ground zero of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandal is the Secretary's ``discretionary fund,'' a honey pot used to fund projects that weren't approved through normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> channels. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> wants to abolish it. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s idea of reform is to increase this slush fund by $28.4 million. And transfer control of much of it to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals will simply continue, but under new mismanagement.
After one of the most amazing debates we've ever seen on the cable channel C-SPAN, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> voted 250 to 170 on Wednesday to order $28.4 million in spending for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> arts center, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> library and 38 other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Pierce</ENAMEX>'s tenure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> has no paper work whatsoever on 30 of the projects, none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them. However, four are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> district of Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Traxler</ENAMEX>, the chairman of the House subcommittee that writes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> spending bill.
Of course, this kind of blatant congressional pork-barreling is called ``constituent service'' by Members, while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> is labeled ``influence peddling.'' Unlike those awful Republican consultants, Members don't profit directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> projects. They merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office.
The 40 pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> versions. Conference committees are breeding grounds for mischief. They are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken. Members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day.
In this case, the Members outdid themselves. They transferred some $28 million from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Development</ENAMEX> Block Grant program designated largely for low - and moderate-income projects and funneled it into such items as:
-- $1.2 million for a performing-arts center in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>,
-- $1.3 million for ``job retention'' in Hawaiian sugar mills.
-- $400,000 for a collapsing utility tunnel in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salisbury</ENAMEX>,
-- $500,000 for ``equipment and landscaping to deter crime and aid police surveillance'' at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> park.
-- $450,000 for ``integrated urban data based in seven cities.'' No other details.
-- $390,000 for a library and recreation center at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mackinac Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traxler</ENAMEX> recently purchased an unimproved building lot on the island.
