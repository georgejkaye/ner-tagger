When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felice Casson</ENAMEX> heard that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch made unauthorized loans to countries besides <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, he called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rome</ENAMEX> for more information.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venice magistrate</ENAMEX>'s interest was understandable. For two years, he has been investigating illegal arms sales by Italian companies to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s archenemy, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>. And he believes he's got convincing evidence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> branches in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> were helping to finance them.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casson</ENAMEX> has said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>'s former chairman, Nerio <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nesi</ENAMEX>, and former director general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giacomo Pedde</ENAMEX>, are under accusation of being accessories to the illegal international traffic of armaments. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nesi</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedde</ENAMEX> have denied wrongdoing.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casson</ENAMEX> says he doesn't know whether the scandal surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch, which allegedly issued some $3 billion of credits to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> without management authorization, will have any bearing on the case he has been building. He has talked informally with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> magistrate investigating the state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bank</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch but adds that ``the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> investigation is still in the most preliminary stage.''
The title magistrate embraces many positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s judicial system, including public prosecutors, judges and investigative attorneys.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casson</ENAMEX> hopes to complete his inquiry within a few months. So far, he adds, he hasn't received any information from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s lending.
The accusations against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nesi</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedde</ENAMEX> are part of a larger investigation by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casson</ENAMEX> into illegal weapons sales to Iran between 1983 and 1988. Since 1967, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> has required Italian companies to gain governmental approval before entering negotiations for arms-export sales. In early 1987, the government prohibited the issuance of any more licenses to export arms to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, which at the time were fighting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf War.</ENAMEX> The hostilities have since ended.
Three other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> staffers are accused by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casson</ENAMEX> of being accessories to illegal arms sales, while eight others are being investigated. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casson</ENAMEX> has also accused some government officials involved in the granting of arms-export licenses.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casson</ENAMEX> says state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> took part in several international banking pools, along with several French banks, that financed the sale of weapons to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>. The largest single transaction involved $131 million of ammunition that on paper was destined for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, but which actually went to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>, he says.
No one disputes the exports in question involved military materials, unlike in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> case, where investigators have only found evidence of exports that could be used in either civilian or defense applications. ``They were things like ammunition shells and gunpowder,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casson</ENAMEX> says.
