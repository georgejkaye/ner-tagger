<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle Clothes Inc.</ENAMEX>, which is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, said it reached an agreement with its creditors.
Under the accord, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Roth</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Chase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Beigel</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Polsky</ENAMEX> will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roth</ENAMEX>, who has been on leave from his posts, will be succeeded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrie D. Lurie</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDL Management Inc.</ENAMEX>, which is Eagle's crisis manager. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lurie</ENAMEX> is currently co-chief executive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Levine</ENAMEX>, acting co-chief executive, will continue as senior vice president and a board member.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX> also said it received a commitment for as much as $8 million in financing from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk Capital Group Inc.</ENAMEX> In addition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norfolk</ENAMEX> affiliate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Capital Inc.</ENAMEX>, will purchase all of the interests of Eagle's secured lenders, which total $11.5 million, and guarantee as much as $8.2 million in payments to Eagle's unsecured creditors. A committee representing the unsecured creditors agreed to accept 24 cents on the dollar, Eagle said.
The plan would extend the period under which Eagle has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan. It would extinguish all of Eagle's existing capital stock and issue new stock to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">York</ENAMEX> as sole holder.
A bankruptcy court hearing is set for Nov. 3 on these accords.
In its bankruptcy-law petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX>, reduced its credit line. In September 1988, Eagle acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biny Clothing Inc.</ENAMEX>, a closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> chain operated under the Bonds name. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle's</ENAMEX> management retired and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biny</ENAMEX>'s management took control of the company.
At the time, Eagle reached a new credit agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> and with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank Leumi Trust Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> for $8 million, and a new subordinated debt accord with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Century Partners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biny</ENAMEX> management for $2 million. But Eagle said the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged.
Under Chapter 11, a company operates under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debts.
