Designer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Garratt</ENAMEX> filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection, saying that her cash flow had been cut off.
The designer, whose line of modular, one-size-fits-all clothing has spawned a host of clones, has been in a dispute with her latest licensee, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerell Inc.</ENAMEX> for several months.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garratt</ENAMEX> was the subject of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> article in March.
The designer's attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly Bartholow</ENAMEX>, said that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garratt</ENAMEX> was forced to start bankruptcy-law proceedings because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerell</ENAMEX> began withholding her royalty payments last month.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerell</ENAMEX> paid Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garratt</ENAMEX> royalties for the line known as Multiples by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Garratt</ENAMEX>, which are sold primarily through department stores. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garratt</ENAMEX> sued the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> apparel maker earlier this year, charging that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerell</ENAMEX> developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned after her designs, in violation of their contract. That lawsuit is still pending.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerell</ENAMEX> couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garratt</ENAMEX>'s assets and liabilities weren't disclosed.
