Backers of legislation aimed at revising the federal racketeering law are scrapping one of the most controversial provisions in the bill.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Deconcini</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>), a chief sponsor of the legislation, has indicated he plans to drop the provision that would make the bill apply to pending racketeering cases, not just future ones.
The overall legislation is designed to take some of the bite out of the 1970 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racketeer Influenced</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrupt Organizations</ENAMEX> law, or RICO. A key part of the bill would eliminate the ability of RICO plaintiffs to get triple damages in most civil RICO suits.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deconcini</ENAMEX>'s move followed a flurry of negative press articles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, highlighting his campaign contributions from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating Jr</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> was hit with two major RICO suits this year following the collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX>, which he owned. Opponents of RICO reform have argued loudly that the retroactivity provision of the bill would bail out Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> and other current RICO defendants.
The business coalition that has fought long and hard for RICO revision is reluctantly going along. ``The real issue is halting these suits prospectively,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Moe</ENAMEX>, who represents the insurance industry. ``There is broad consensus that this is the last chance for passing RICO reform. No one wants to jeopardize it.'' Similar RICO legislation has died on the vine each of the past four years.
``They are throwing things overboard to keep the balloon afloat,'' maintains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Waldman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Citizen</ENAMEX>, part of the odd but potent alliance of consumer groups, plaintiffs attorneys and some corporations (most of which are plaintiffs in pending RICO cases) that has so far blocked the RICO legislation.
The legislation's outlook in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, is hazy as staffers to Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hughes</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>), head of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary</ENAMEX> subcommittee, ponder various approaches.
``What looked like a done deal earlier this year is now a wild card,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> lawyer fighting the legislation.
A FORMER <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> OFFICER pleaded guilty to federal stock-fraud charges.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheldon Kanoff</ENAMEX>, 53, who served as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>'s chief examiner for broker-dealer inspection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> regional office from 1970 to 1983, pleaded guilty yesterday in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>,
The charges stemmed from an alleged stock-conspiracy scheme engineered by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kanoff</ENAMEX> and other former officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.D. Roberts Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kanoff</ENAMEX> was a former president, partner and director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paramus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>-based pennystock firm that ceased operating and filed under bankruptcy-law proceedings in February. None of the charges were related to any of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kanoff</ENAMEX>'s activities at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kanoff</ENAMEX>, who agreed to cooperate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX> U.S. Attorney's investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">F.D.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>, faces a potential prison sentence and fines on two counts of stock-fraud conspiracy and a combined count of stock and tax fraud, according to the agreement read by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas H. Politan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Weiss</ENAMEX>, 44, another former president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">F.D.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>, pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud and one count of filing a false income-tax return in 1987. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weiss</ENAMEX> also faces a potential prison sentence and fines.
Also, three former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">F.D.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> brokers yesterday pleaded guilty to stock-fraud charges. A total of 12 F.D. Roberts investors and employees so far have pleaded guilty to stock-fraud conspiracy, said Assistant U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph G. Braunreuther</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braunreuther</ENAMEX> said the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">F.D.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> conspirators bilked clients out of ``tens of millions of dollars'' by inflating prices of stocks sold.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEXAS PRISON</ENAMEX> OFFICIALS block publication of inmates' monthly newspaper.
The officials apparently are concerned about whether legal articles written by inmates have been accurate -- and about whether they have incited other inmates to file more legal grievances.
The actual censorship started with the suspension of a staff-written legal column in the June issue of the newspaper, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echo.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subsequently</ENAMEX>, the newspaper wasn't allowed to be published at all in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX>.
The columnist, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Farrar</ENAMEX>, a lawyer who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inmate Legal Services</ENAMEX> office, said he received conflicting information from prison officials about the reason for the ban on legal articles. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrar</ENAMEX> said the Echo traditionally has been barred from publishing articles about civil rights issues, the basis for many lawsuits by prisoners. His column deals with recent state court cases on detention and appeals.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrar</ENAMEX> said the suspension of his column and other law articles is under investigation by the court-appointed special master who has been monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> prisons since a federal judge found widespread civil rights violations in the penal system in 1982. The investigation focuses on whether the censorship violates prisoners' right to access to the courts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prison</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Brown</ENAMEX>, who is also the adviser to the inmate editor and staff of the Echo, said the 35,000-circulation newspaper will resume publication -- under closer scrutiny by the administration -- with a double issue to cover August and September. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farrar</ENAMEX>'s column will return in the October issue.
``As long as the information is appropriate and accurate, it will be allowed in the paper,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> said. He said appropriate articles would include almost anything ``as long as it's of interest to the inmates.''
But, he added, ``you wouldn't want to supply inmates with information that would come back to haunt you.''
AIDS CASES: In the past five years, AIDS has generated enough legal issues to fill a 1,000-page text. The newly published, ``AIDS: Cases and Materials,'' is the first casebook to cover the impact of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome on the law, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael L. Closen</ENAMEX>, a key editor of the book and a professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Marshall Law School</ENAMEX>. About 40 law schools in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> are currently conducting or planning to conduct courses on AIDS, and Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Closen</ENAMEX> estimates that by the end of the spring semester the casebook should be used in courses at 10 of the law schools.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYERSON & KUHN</ENAMEX> DEFECTOR: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Halprin</ENAMEX>, formerly a partner in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> office of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myerson & Kuhn</ENAMEX>, has joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Verner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Liipfert</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bernhard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcpherson & Hand</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Halprin</ENAMEX>, 41, specializes in telecommunications and was previously chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX>'s common carrier bureau.
