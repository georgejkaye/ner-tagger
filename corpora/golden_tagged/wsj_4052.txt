<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin S. Ackerman</ENAMEX> and corporate raider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asher Edelman</ENAMEX> fired a volley of charges at each other as the bitter battle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint Corp.</ENAMEX> began officially.
In a letter to shareholders accompanying his recently mailed consent solicitation, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX>, who is seeking to oust the board controlled by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX>, said that since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> took control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, maker of computer products in 1985, shareholders' equity has fallen 35%, to $151 million from $232 million. And while the company lost $126 million during that time, the letter says, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX>, his associates and companies controlled by him have received more than $15 million in salaries and fees from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelogic Trace Inc.</ENAMEX>, which was spun off from Datapoint a few years ago.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> responded with his own letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> shareholders, accusing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> of trying to replace an elected board ``with his own hand-picked nominees.'' In the letter, he said the company is still preparing information about the corporate bankruptcies with which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> has been associated, as well as ``other interesting data.'' It didn't provide further details.
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> vie for shareholder loyalties, what may be the deciding battle is being fought in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> court, which must decide whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> may vote the three million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> shares he bought after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> announced his consent solicitation. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> is challenging the purchase on several grounds, saying it was improper and made ``solely to thwart the consent solicitation.''
A decision in favor of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> -- giving him control of 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>'s shares -- could well doom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX>'s takeover bid. To gain control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>'s board, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> must obtain by Nov. 6 consents from holders of more than 50% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>'s shares outstanding.
