At a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> cocktail party this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mccabe</ENAMEX> was approached by a British lawyer who asked about rumors that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccabe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearman & Sterling</ENAMEX>, would merge with a British counterpart.
Moments later the two were joined by a lawyer from the British firm they were just discussing. He immediately asked whether they were plotting a merger.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearman & Sterling</ENAMEX> wasn't negotiating to affiliate with either firm. But the incident reflects the uproar that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law firms are creating on the international legal scene as they scramble to take advantage of the dismantling of internal European trade barriers by 1992.
For big U.S. law firms the goal is simple: to capture the business of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, European and Asian companies doing -- or planning -- cross-border transactions within the 12-nation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>. Many U.S. firms also want to be a lobbying presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> headquarters, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> writes the rules that will govern the industrialized world's biggest market.
``The effect of 1992 on American firms is here and now,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccabe</ENAMEX>, whose law firm has offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. ``I don't think there is a major foreign client of the firm that hasn't undertaken a major transaction that perhaps was spurred by 1992 -- or is considering trying one.''
The big U.S. firms are betting they will have an edge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> not only because they dwarf their foreign rivals but also because they are years ahead in putting together complex mergers and acquisitions. They maintain that the increase in these transactions is sure to generate work for U.S. corporate lawyers, even when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law isn't a factor.
U.S. firms work fast and are used to throwing dozens of lawyers at a deal, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lee</ENAMEX>, a partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearman & Sterling</ENAMEX>'s 25-lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> office. European lawyers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> says, ``go home for the weekend. You can call an American lawyer at three in the morning and ask a dumb question and he'll answer it. You wouldn't dare call a European lawyer at 3 a.m.''
European lawyers don't necessarily agree. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Thoma</ENAMEX>, a West German lawyer, insists that European lawyers are as available as their U.S. counterparts and that the results of their work are comparable. But, he says, ``surely we don't produce so much paper. Our legal system is different.''
Nonetheless, U.S. corporations are accustomed to dealing with the big U.S. firms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Richard Edmondson</ENAMEX>, senior vice president and general counsel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bristol Myers Co.</ENAMEX>, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> invasion of the European legal market should be helpful to corporations such as his. He has already consulted a European firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> on issues related to the changing European marketplace, but he sees an increasing need for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law firms in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predictably</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law firms' interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> has generated a lively turf war. Some major law firms based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> are trying to expand their small offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>. Others are planning assaults on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, forming loose affiliations with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> firms or opening offices there.
Suddenly Belgian lawyers, especially those with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> practices, are being courted by U.S. firms. Last spring Akin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gump</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strauss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hauer & Feld</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, opened a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> office in conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">De Smaedt & Danssesse</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> law firm. The move triggered the kind of upheaval that is common in the volatile <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> legal market but that has been rare in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillippe-Francois Lebrun</ENAMEX>, a senior partner in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> firm, decided he didn't want his practice controlled by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> firm and defected with a group of associates.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Norall</ENAMEX> said his small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> law firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Forester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norall & Sutton</ENAMEX>, has been approached by five to 10 U.S. law firms. ``At the present time I think our view is we prefer to go it alone,'' he said. For law firms with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> expertise like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norall</ENAMEX>'s, the dilemma is whether to remain independent and hope to receive referrals of business from many sources, or to join forces with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> firm and perhaps limit the number of firms willing to exchange business.
Partnerships between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and European lawyers are permitted in some nations and not in others, though the rules of many countries are under review. But less formal affiliations between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and European firms are in vogue. ``It's sort of a mating dance but no engagement and no marriage,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Shapiro</ENAMEX>, a partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skadden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arps</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meagher, Slate & Flom</ENAMEX>, which is studying its European options. The firm has a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> office.
In recent weeks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunn & Crutcher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phillips</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nizer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Benjamin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krim & Ballon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> have both associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> firms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Melveny & Myers</ENAMEX>, the giant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> firm headed by former Deputy Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Christopher</ENAMEX>, has affiliated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macfarlanes</ENAMEX>, a mid-sized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> firm.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macfarlanes</ENAMEX> continues to play the field a bit. Recently a representative from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macfarlanes</ENAMEX> paid a visit to at least one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> firm and explained that the relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Melveny</ENAMEX> isn't exclusive and that the firm still wants to do business with other U.S. firms.
``We have bean approached by an endless stream of people with rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skadden</ENAMEX> is doing this or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skadden</ENAMEX> is doing that,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX>. ``Everybody's saying,'Don't do anything without talking to us.''' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX> contends <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> ``is going to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.'' His firm recently sent an associate to work at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> office of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law Offices</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.G.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archibald</ENAMEX> for six weeks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Venit</ENAMEX>, the partner with whom he worked, has decided to defect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilmer</ENAMEX> has chosen not to affiliate but to go it alone in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, where it will open an office Dec. 1.
As U.S. firms clamor to make their mark in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, most agree that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottlieb</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Steen & Hamilton</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, has the clear edge. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleary</ENAMEX>, which opened its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> branch in 1960, has more than 30 attorneys there, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and European lawyers. ``We think of ourselves not as the European office of an American firm,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter W. Oberreit</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleary</ENAMEX> partner. ``We are very much a European office.
