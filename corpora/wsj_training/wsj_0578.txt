If this battle were a movie, the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common.
In the opener, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> would agree to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> in a transaction valued at close to $5 billion. Shortly after that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> would offer to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> for $200 million and offer its co-chairmen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX>, the chance to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> would fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> with the intention of telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven J. Ross</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>.
That's where the two scripts would diverge. In affidavits filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Superior Court</ENAMEX> in connection with the $1 billion breach-of-contract suit Warner brought against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> for hiring the two producers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> tell one story. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> tells another.
In the affidavits, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> says he was ``shocked'' when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> claims he reminded Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Semel</ENAMEX>, the top executives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Brothers</ENAMEX> studio, had ``repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept'' an offer such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s. In response, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> says, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> referred to his colleagues at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> with an ``obscenity'' and said: ``Tell them that they don't have a job. You can take them with you.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> denies Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> ever said any such thing, and, in fact, denies virtually everything Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> say in their affidavits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomorrow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> will file another batch of documents contending that ``the essence of everything these guys are saying is basically lies,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s chief outside counsel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Rabinowitz</ENAMEX>. Thursday, a judge is scheduled to rule on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s motion seeking to block the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> duo from going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>.
The battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> dogfight. But they also make it clear that the first thing a judge will have to decide is which, if any, version of events in this morass is fiction, and which fact.
The matter may never even be tried in court. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations, but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, which is in the process of merging with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX>, says it is willing to settle the matter out of court. So far, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> hasn't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> don't have much to gain from a protracted battle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, for its part, could decide that the cost of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> settlement or court fight is too high, choosing instead to find someone else to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>. In that case, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> might not suffer financially, but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>.
At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and the two producers, but other murkier issues will play a big role. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> team are hanging much of their case on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> denies such an agreement was made, and disputes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter.
Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides' current business dealings. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> say in their affidavits that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, notably the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvester Stallone</ENAMEX> film ``Tango and Cash.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> says in his affidavit that the movie's staff was told last week that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> was ``taking over'' the picture, and another producer would be giving all of the orders. Over his objections, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> says, the film's release date was moved up ``by many months'' to December, and plans for a soundtrack ``worth millions of dollars'' were dropped.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert de la Bouillaire</ENAMEX>, an editor on the film, backs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> in a separate sworn declaration. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Bouillaire</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Brothers</ENAMEX> production president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Canton</ENAMEX> called him Oct. 19 and said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> is ``off the picture. If he calls you up, just tell him everything is fine.'' The editor also says the new producer on the film, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Baird</ENAMEX>, told editors to screen the picture without telling stars <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvester Stallone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Russell</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>. ``The less they know, the easier it is for us. If someone asks, just lie and tell them it will be done,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de la Bouillaire</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baird</ENAMEX> told them.
That, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabinowitz</ENAMEX>, is ``a total 100% lie.'' The movie, he says, is in its post-production stages of ``cleaning up the film.'' He says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>, as the contractual producers with consultation rights, have been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film. Dozens of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> staffers are still working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> lot and consulting on various projects on a ``daily basis,'' the attorney says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>, in his affidavit, says that when he advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Semel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> offer at lunch on Sept. 25, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> ``hugged and congratulated me, and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says he brought to lunch a release document <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> had agreed to in 1988, when he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> made an aborted bid to buy part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX> studio. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says he had crossed out ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>'' with a red pen and written in ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>,'' giving the document to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX>. ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> said absolutely nothing to indicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> would have any objection to our assuming management positions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX>, in his affidavit, doesn't mention any hugging or congratulating. He says he told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> he couldn't sign any documents and that ``the deal, although apparently a good one for him and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>, would have a very negative impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner.</ENAMEX>'' He said he would contact Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Brothers</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Daly</ENAMEX> and that, in a conference call, the three agreed they couldn't let the producers out of their contract.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX>, in his own affidavit, says he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> instructed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> to tell the producers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> wouldn't terminate their agreement.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> did convey that information and that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> was ``crazy because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> deal,'' meaning, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says, that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> ``did not want to communicate to his new merger partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> also says in his affidavit that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> ``told us that even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> did not want us, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s relationship with us already was irreparably damaged, that there was no way `to put the egg together,' and that it would sue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> for tons of money.''
Moreover, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> claims, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> told him that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> probably wouldn't object ``if it were anybody other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is a problem.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> side has said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge Japanese company controlling important segments of the U.S. entertainment business.
Some in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> suggest Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> took encouragement from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> studio executives such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canton</ENAMEX> too literally. According to this theory, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives, hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers, encouraged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers they could get out of their written contract.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabinowitz</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> attorney, says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract. ``They are like a mini-studio; they have 50 projects in development for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>,'' he says.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used. For example, he says that since 1985, he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> have developed over 85 movie projects, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has ``passed'' or chosen not to produce at least 76.
As for the projects remaining at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> says, ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Semel</ENAMEX> informed me that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s producers have already started a `feeding frenzy' for our projects.
