Three top executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s beleaguered U.S. sales arm resigned suddenly and a fourth accepted reassignment to an unspecified job with the auto maker in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
The sweeping changes are a further disruption for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX>, which hasn't rebounded from safety allegations last year against its Samurai sport utility vehicle. The moves also come on the heels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX>'s inability this year to successfully sell its first car in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
The three executives who resigned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Suzuki Motor Corp.</ENAMEX>, effective yesterday, are: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Mazza</ENAMEX>, vice president and general manager; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dorsey</ENAMEX>, director of sales; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Messelt</ENAMEX>, national sales manager. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Suzuki</ENAMEX> officials also said that the company's president for the past five years, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshiyuki Arai</ENAMEX>, will return to a job in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> at the beginning of October.
The company said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenji Shimizu</ENAMEX>, who was brought in above  Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arai</ENAMEX> as America <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> chairman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, will assume Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arai</ENAMEX>'s title. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimizu</ENAMEX> also oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> motorcycle, outboard motor and generator sales. The company is also transferring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yoshi Fujii</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> to become executive vice president of the U.S. subsidiary.
No successors were named to replace the American executives who resigned. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mazza</ENAMEX>, a former U.S. distribution manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Motor Corp.</ENAMEX>, joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> in 1985 shortly before it launched the Samurai in the U.S. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mazza</ENAMEX> lured Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorsey</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> and he, in turn, hired Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Messelt</ENAMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mazza</ENAMEX> said in an interview yesterday that the recent arrival of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimizu</ENAMEX> and the pending arrival of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fujii</ENAMEX> had ``no direct role'' in his resignation.
Speaking for the other two American officials, he said in a prepared statement: ``As a result of changes in the company's operating goals and philosophies, we have decided the time is right to move on to new challenges.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mazza</ENAMEX> declined to state more specifically what changes caused the resignations. But a spokeswoman for the company said the changes involved product-marketing priorities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> enjoyed impressive growth selling only the Samurai during its first three years in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> But last year, Consumer Reports magazine published an extensive story that condemned the Samurai as unsafe because of its alleged tendency to roll over during sudden turns.
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ENAMEX> refused to open a safety investigation into the allegations and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> aggressively challenged its critics, Samurai sales evaporated.
Last fall, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX>'s U.S. officials hoped to improve their standing with the new Sidekick sport utility vehicle and the subcompact Swift, which was the first car sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Neither vehicle has met expectations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> officials expected to ship 20,000 cars and 30,000 trucks a year at first. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki</ENAMEX> has sold only 4,000 Swifts so far this year and watched its truck sales drop 65% from already depressed levels to just 17,419 units.
