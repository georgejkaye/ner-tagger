<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb Corp.</ENAMEX> bought marketing rights to a family of experimental drugs that, its developer claims, hold promise for treating acne, skin wrinkling and baldness.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Squibb</ENAMEX> is buying the rights, for an amount that wasn't disclosed, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chantal Pharmaceutical Corp.</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> company that discovered and has been testing the drugs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chantal</ENAMEX> said it is in advanced stages of testing one of the drugs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyoctol</ENAMEX>, as a topical treatment for mild to severe acne. Another chemically related drug, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethocyn</ENAMEX>, is being tested as an anti-wrinkling cream.
The acquisition is expected to generate wide interest because there has been much publicity in recent years over drugs which are being touted as hair-growing or wrinkle-fighting treatments. Sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson & Johnson</ENAMEX>'s Retin-A acne drug have increased sharply since reports were released that it can smooth some wrinkles.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn Co.</ENAMEX> last year received the first government approval to sell a drug, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogaine</ENAMEX>, for hair loss.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chantal</ENAMEX> drugs are different from these compounds in that they are so-called anti-androgens. The drugs apparently block the action of male hormones that, when released by the body in excessive amounts, are believed to cause such problems as acne and baldness. Many drug companies have searched in vain for years for safe anti-androgen drugs. The first compound which led to the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chantal</ENAMEX> drugs was discovered by the company's chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chantal Burnison</ENAMEX>, in 1978. The company, formed in 1979, began clinical trials of the drugs about four years ago, but has yet to release any results publicly.
``We have data that indicate that the drugs are working, that they are very safe and effective,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burnison</ENAMEX> said in a telephone interview. ``We showed the studies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb</ENAMEX> and that's why they agreed to sign a deal.''
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burnison</ENAMEX> said the company didn't want to release the studies, performed by outside researchers, until it had received patent protection and had found a marketing partner. She said a study of the drug's use in treating baldness would be released at a medical meeting in December. In over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chantal</ENAMEX> shares were trading at $3.1875, down 18.75 cents.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb</ENAMEX> declined to release details of the drugs' studies, but said that ``there was sufficient data to support our interest in this opportunity.'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burnison</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb</ENAMEX> was especially interested in the acne treatment.
She said the drug would compete against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Accutane</ENAMEX>, the anti-acne drug sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoffmann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Roche Inc.</ENAMEX>, the U.S. unit of the Swiss company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F. Hoffmann-Laroche & Co.</ENAMEX> Accutane, while very effective, is restricted to very severe acne cases because it can cause birth defects when taken by pregnant women.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burnison</ENAMEX> said Chantal wanted to sign on with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb</ENAMEX> because of that company's pending merger with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bristol-Myers Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chantal</ENAMEX> believes the drugs, which are being developed for the prescription market, may be safe enough to sell eventually as non-prescription products. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bristol-Myers</ENAMEX> has a large non-prescription business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chantal</ENAMEX> said the agreement ``brings solid financial resources to the company.
