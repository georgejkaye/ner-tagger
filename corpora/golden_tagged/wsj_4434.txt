If you're looking for that special card to say you're sorry, forget Hallmark. Fly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maureen Macfadden</ENAMEX> did. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, consumer sales representative was jolted around earlier this month when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> jet that she was on landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Hare International Airport</ENAMEX> with its front landing gear collapsed. Passengers hadn't been warned of the rough landing and few were prepared. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macfadden</ENAMEX>'s briefcase shot forward as the plane careened 6,600 feet down the runway. When it stopped, the travelers -- relieved that they had survived -- cheered.
Suddenly, a flight attendant screamed. Another shouted, ``Get off the plane '' The businessman sitting in a window seat beside Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macfadden</ENAMEX> trampled over her to get out. She herself rushed toward an emergency chute in the evacuation, which turned out to be precautionary.
Then came a different kind of shocker. As the dazed passengers filed off a shuttle bus that ferried them to the terminal, they were greeted by agents passing out white cards embossed with this sentiment: ``Dear Passenger: No matter how hard we try, there are inevitable occasions when there is a problem. Please accept our apology for the inconvenience.''
``It was like a joke,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macfadden</ENAMEX> scoffs. ``Yeah, you almost killed me, and you're saying,'Sorry, for the inconvenience.' Right.''
Adds passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard Behague</ENAMEX>, a professor of music at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>: ``I overheard some people saying exactly the same thing I was thinking: What a strange form. I felt,'Oh  my gosh, they anticipated that an accident would happen. They have an apology ready.'''
Sure enough, the ``oops'' card is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American's</ENAMEX> airport emergency kits, and has been for several years. ``We think it's good customer service policy,'' says a spokesman. The flip side of the card has blanks for passenger name, seat number, address and other statistics, so travelers can, say, register for lost luggage. Adds the spokesman: ``Would they have preferred that we had handed them blank sheets of paper?'' The card doesn't cover acts of God: American won't pass it out for flights delayed by weather problems. But no problem on this flight -- it arrived five minutes early.
