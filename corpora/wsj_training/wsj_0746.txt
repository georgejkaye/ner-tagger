Swedish rolling-steel and ball-bearing group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB SKF</ENAMEX> said its pretax profit rose 78% to 1.78 billion kronor ($278 million) in the first nine months from one billion kronor ($156 million) in the corresponding period a year earlier.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX> said demand for the group's main product, rolling bearings, remained favorable in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, which accounts for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales. Latin American markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX> said.
The company said the situation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is still uncertain as reduced production in the country's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings.
Analysts said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX>'s results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of 1.74 billion to 1.86 billion kronor.
The three business areas engaged in rolling bearing operations continued to show favorable sales development. Sales of rolling bearings increased 19% to 15.7 billion kronor from 13.2 billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year.
