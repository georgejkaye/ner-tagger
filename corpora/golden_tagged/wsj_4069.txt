The outlook for the British stock market is turning foggy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s economy is slowing visibly and few people expect it to grow much more than 1% next year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inflation</ENAMEX>, which recently receded to a 7.3% annual rate, might turn higher because of recent and impending wage settlements for increases of around 9%.
Many analysts expect a generally flat stock market near-term, although a few hardy optimists say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 100-stock index may hit 2700 soon (it closed at 2299.4 Friday). Last week's current-account figures for August showed the third-worst monthly deficit in history. The numbers reinforced the belief that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s already high base lending rate will remain at 14% for several more months, and prompted fears that it could go higher.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s bulls have been counting on a continuation of the takeover boom here. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Hodgson</ENAMEX>, chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> Scrimgeour <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vickers</ENAMEX>, suspects the takeover explosion is coming to an end, with ``fairly serious implications for the equity market.''
So much bank lending has gone to finance takeovers, he says, that companies now are using a record amount of internally generated money to finance capital expansion. Soon corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> will face a tough choice, he says: Curb takeovers, or pay for them with newly issued equities, which would dilute shareholdings.
Despite a rocky week last week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> stock market as measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times-Stock  Exchange</ENAMEX> 100 Share Index isn't too far from its historic high of 2443, set two years ago. Although almost no one is predicting a repeat of the 1987 crash, many analysts are doing the British equivalent of circling the wagons. They are looking for short-term defensive investments.
Many say the best stocks now are the food retailers and manufacturers, brewers, life insurers, banks, pharmaceutical makers and international conglomerates whose industrial eggs aren't all in the U.K. basket. Popping up on the ``sell'' lists these days are building and real-estate concerns (because of high interst rates), retailers (especially upscale ones), chemical companies and full-service insurers.
Shares of many British companies are traded in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> markets through American depositary receipts. Others can be bought or sold through U.S. brokers who place orders directly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Kersley</ENAMEX>, U.K. equity strategist at Barclays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Zoete Wedd</ENAMEX>, ticks off a ``defensive'' triad: Companies with hefty overseas operations, ``particularly in dollars,'' cash-rich concerns able to sustain dividends and companies with ``low volatility of earnings.''
Among food retailers, he prefers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tesco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Sainsbury</ENAMEX>, while among food makers, he says, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Biscuits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> ``are reasonable defensive plays, with the added spice'' that they could be takeover targets. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn Moses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX>'s investment strategist, calls food manufacturing ``a solid area'' now and finds Nestle well-placed in that group.
Among brewers, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> favors Guinness, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Brown</ENAMEX>, U.K. equity strategist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBS Phillips & Drew</ENAMEX>, has a longer list: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied-Lyons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenall Whitley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish & Newcastle Breweries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitbread</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays</ENAMEX>' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kersley</ENAMEX> picks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legal & General Group</ENAMEX> as a good bet among life insurers, an industry he calls ``a safe haven during anything that looks like a recession.'' Life insurers' average dividend yields of about 5 1/2% are above the overall market's 4% average, he adds.
Banks, with an average 6% yield and a demonstrated willingness to bite the bullet on doubtful Third World loans, are on some ``buy'' lists. Of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Four</ENAMEX>, which include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Westminster Bank</ENAMEX>, only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midland Bank</ENAMEX> is giving analysts real pause. ``There's a lot of fluff in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>'s price,'' asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Hennefeld</ENAMEX>, director of European research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch International.</ENAMEX> She says that the price reflects repeated rumors of a takeover by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai Bank</ENAMEX> and that on fundamentals, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX> is overpriced.
Rounding out defensive lists at many firms are pharmaceutical makers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaxo Holdings and conglomerates Hanson PLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BTR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BET</ENAMEX>.
What stocks should be avoided? Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kersley</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor Woodrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMC Group</ENAMEX> are among the vulnerable builders. ``Stay as far away as possible from the stores {retailing} sector,'' warns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX>'s Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX>. The group, already slumping, is in for ``a much weaker'' second half because high interest rates will further crimp credit purchases, she explains. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storehouse</ENAMEX>, with its Habitat furniture chain, ``is at the bottom of the barrel'' and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ratners Group</ENAMEX> jewelry chain also is worth unloading, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> says.
According to analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alasdair Nisbet</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips & Drew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Chemical Industries</ENAMEX> is grappling with rising labor costs and sagging prices for some bulk chemicals. ``These point to a performance that can't be anything other than disappointing,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nisbet</ENAMEX> says.
Insurers that rely on property-related premiums also are expected to come under pressure. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kersley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays</ENAMEX> says he's ``particularly concerned about'' Commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Assurance, Guardian Royal Exchange</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Insurance.</ENAMEX> But he is ``quite keen on'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Alliance & London Insurance</ENAMEX> because its ``very strong balance sheet'' and cash flow augur a continued healthy dividend policy.
