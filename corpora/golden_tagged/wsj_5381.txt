Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> ousted two hard-line conservative members of the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> as part of a Kremlin reshuffling that appears to further consolidate his power.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vladimir Shcherbitsky</ENAMEX>, the 71-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ukraine</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viktor Chebrikov</ENAMEX>, former head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX> secret police and head of a committee overseeing legal reform, both ``retired'' in the reshuffling, which was announced following a meeting of the party's policy-setting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX>.
A third full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> member, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viktor Nikonov</ENAMEX>, who had been nominally in charge of agriculture, also was dropped, as were two candidates or nonvoting, members.
Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shcherbitsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chebrikov</ENAMEX> were both widely seen as opposing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s reforms. A friend and colleague of the now discredited former leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonid Brezhnev</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shcherbitsky</ENAMEX> battled to keep the Ukraine a bastion of ``old thinking,'' resisting efforts to introduce contested elections in the republic and cracking down hard on nationalist groups.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chebrikov</ENAMEX>, 66 years old, lost his job as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX> chief in a reshuffling one year ago but used his continued power base to snipe at perestroika. In recent weeks, he has made tough speeches urging drastic action to prevent the nation sliding into anarchy. His ouster may have been hastened by an article in the weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> News this month that linked him to the brutal killing of demonstrators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Georgia</ENAMEX> last April.
The reshuffling doesn't remove all the hard-liners from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s leading conservative critic, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yegor Ligachev</ENAMEX>, remains a powerful member, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chebrikov</ENAMEX>'s successor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vladimir Kryuchkov</ENAMEX>, was elevated to the ruling body. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kryuchkov</ENAMEX> has been given the task of opening the secret police to greater public scrutiny, but his loyalty to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> isn't certain. The head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Commission</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Maslyukov</ENAMEX>, was also promoted to full membership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX>. Many reform-minded Soviet economists say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maslyukov</ENAMEX> is a cautious advocate of change who believes that the rigid economic planning system shouldn't be dismantled too rapidly.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikonov</ENAMEX>, 60 years old, appears to have lost a tussle with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ligachev</ENAMEX> over who should be in charge of overhauling the nation's beleaguered farming system. Both men were officially supposed to run agriculture, with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ligachev</ENAMEX> setting policy and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikonov</ENAMEX> implementing it. The efforts of neither have yielded fruit, and consumers complain about worsening shortages of basic foodstuffs such as meat, cheese and sugar. Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikolai Ryzhkov</ENAMEX> hinted at an impending shake-up in July when he told a meeting of party leaders it was unnecessary to have two men in charge of agriculture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Politburo</ENAMEX>.
The reshuffling comes amid a growing sense of gloom and despondency in the nation as numerous problems such as ethnic unrest and economic decline have grown more acute. Many Soviet reformers have expressed fears that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> himself may be in trouble unless he can seize the initiative, while conservatives have complained publicly that perestroika has already gone too far.
As well as ousting the two hard-liners, the Soviet leader has been strongly advocating party unity and the restoration of national calm since his return from summer vacation earlier this month. But so far, there are no signs of any major shift in his policies.
He told the two-day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX> meeting that the Soviet leadership ``shouldn't submit to those who would like to leave us in the past and put us into reverse gear, or to those who offer adventurist programs instead of serious policies.''
The two nonvoting members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> who were ousted are both marginal figures whose departure was expected. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuri Solovyov</ENAMEX> lost his job as head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leningrad</ENAMEX> party organization earlier this year after failing to be elected to the new Soviet parliament even though he ran unopposed; he was unable to get the required 50% of the votes. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikolai Talyzin</ENAMEX> lost much of his power when he was succeeded by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maslyukov</ENAMEX> as head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Planning Commission</ENAMEX>.
In their place, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX> appointed Yevgeny <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Primakov</ENAMEX>, a reform-minded academic who heads one of the Soviet parliament's two chambers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boris Pugo</ENAMEX>, head of the party's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Committee</ENAMEX>, to the posts of nonvoting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> members.
