<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual. That may be the last thing she needs.
As the air clears from last week's storm of resignations and reshufflings, the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies. The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer, the untested <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Major</ENAMEX>, need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> has to come to terms with European economic integration, beginning with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> is committed to joining fully someday. Finally, the government has to convince a rattled financial community -- and voters -- it is proceeding coherently toward its goals.
It sounds like the work of a decade, but the deadline is late 1991, when Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> is expected to call another national election. What's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable. She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation, high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit.
Though Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> has pulled through other crises, supporters wonder if her steely, autocratic ways are the right formula today. ``There's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s style of management has become a political liability,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Martin</ENAMEX>, senior economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> brokers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBS-Phillips & Drew</ENAMEX>.
The prime minister's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> -- confused the financial community. Last week, the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up: Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> quit in exasperation and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Walters</ENAMEX>, the adviser, announced his resignation within an hour.
The confusion could be costly. Currency traders, suspecting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major</ENAMEX> won't defend the pound strenuously, sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark. Analysts expect further jitters this week.
A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate, currently 15%. That could shove a weak economy into recession. Economists have been anticipating a slump for months, but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s economy ``is developing rapidly toward no-growth,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Paul Horne</ENAMEX>, international economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Upham Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
A mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991, economists say, while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992. Recovery could be hampered if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s major trading partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, which are enjoying robust economic activity, cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991.
That would leave Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> little room for maneuver. For the Tories to win the next election, voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand. Though Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> doesn't need to call an election until June 1992, she would prefer doing so in late 1991. ``If the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year's time, she will be very vulnerable,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Barnes</ENAMEX>, a lecturer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London School of Economics</ENAMEX>.
There's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>. It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Monetary System</ENAMEX>, which links the major EC currencies. At a June EC summit, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership, saying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> would join once its inflation rate fell and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> liberalized capital movements.
Since then, the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join. Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX> assailed the monetary arrangement as ``half-baked'' in an article being published in an American economics journal. That produced little reaction from his boss, reinforcing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for avoiding full EMS membership.
Despite the departure of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> and Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan</ENAMEX>, the tug-of-war over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX> could continue. Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoffrey Howe</ENAMEX>, deputy prime minister and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> ally on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EMS</ENAMEX>, has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership.
Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> and responding in kind when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> authorities move interest rates. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> ``doesn't like taking orders from foreigners,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Congdon</ENAMEX>, economist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerrard & National Holding PLC</ENAMEX>.
As Conservatives rally around Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> during the crisis, many harbor hopes last week's debacle will prompt change. ``We won't have any more of this wayward behavior,'' says Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Hordern</ENAMEX>, a backbench Tory member of Parliament. ``The party is fed up with sackings of good people.''
It's an unrealistic expectation. As long as a decade ago, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> declared she didn't want debate in her cabinet; she wanted strong government. Over the weekend, she said she didn't intend to change her style and denied she is authoritarian. ``Nonsense,'' she told an interviewer yesterday on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> Weekend Television. ``I am staying my own sweet, reasonable self.
