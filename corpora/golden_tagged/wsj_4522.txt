A group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas & Partners Inc.</ENAMEX> said it offered to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Intertech Corp.</ENAMEX> for $27.50 a share, or $355 million.
Despite the significant premium over market value offered in the bid, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Intertech</ENAMEX> said its board unanimously rejected it. ``The board is committed to enhancing shareholder value and believes that can best be achieved by pursuing the company's long-range strategic growth plan under existing management,'' the company said in a release. In over-the-counter trading Wednesday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Intertech</ENAMEX> closed at $19 a share, down 37.5 cents.
The rejection clouded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haas</ENAMEX>'s hopes for a friendly transaction. In a prepared statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert B. Haas</ENAMEX>, chairman, said, ``We have never engaged in a hostile acquisition... nor have we ever engaged in a'break-up' transaction.''
The offer is the largest acquisition bid in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas & Partners</ENAMEX> has been involved. The private investment firm formed after the recent break-up of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hicks & Haas Inc.</ENAMEX>, the leveraged-buy-out firm that became a major player in the soft-drink industry. In its first transaction earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas & Partners</ENAMEX> agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Products Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of Radnor <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airgas Inc.</ENAMEX>, for $70 million in cash and debt.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haas</ENAMEX> has previously said that his company intends to acquire publicly held and closely held companies with niches in manufacturing, commercial and industrial areas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Intertech</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Youngstown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, maker of hydraulic components, fluid purification devices and metal products, employs about 4,000 people in 30 facilities around the world. In 1988, the company reported net income of $16.6 million on revenue of $398.6 million.
The offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Intertech</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckeye Acquisition Co.</ENAMEX>, a corporation formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas & Partners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth F. Yontz</ENAMEX>, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sybron Corp.</ENAMEX>, a maker and marketer of laboratory and dental products.
