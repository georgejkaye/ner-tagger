Forget about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Lou Retton</ENAMEX>. In a few years, the face on your box of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheaties</ENAMEX> could be that of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota Fats</ENAMEX>.
Once dismissed as the province of hustlers and other unsavory types, billiards is bucking to get into the Olympics.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andee Atkisson</ENAMEX>, two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> enthusiasts, are lobbying to make billiards, pocket or otherwise, a demonstration or exhibition sport as early as the 1992 Summer Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>. They've held informal talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Rowan</ENAMEX>, general counsel for the U.S. Olympic committee, and plan to participate in a trade show in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barcelona</ENAMEX> this fall.
The couple -- who happen to own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peter Vitalie Co.</ENAMEX>, a pool-table maker in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rosman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX> -- is also drumming up support from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Billiards Congress</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>. Billiards ``is finally getting all the respect it deserves,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCA</ENAMEX> spokeswoman says.
With over 33 million billiards players in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and another 20 million world-wide, the couple reason that the games belong in the Games just as much as, say, ping-pong. It's also good business. ``Every {billiards} manufacturer in the world would be interested in having the sport in the Olympics,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitalie</ENAMEX> spokesman.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atkissons</ENAMEX> have work ahead. Few new sports are selected each year, and the choices are highly political as countries push for the events in which they perform well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brunswick Corp.</ENAMEX>, which makes bowling equipment, spent about five years and almost $1 million to help make bowling an exhibition sport -- a category that isn't even officially recognized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Olympic Committee</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacqueline Barrett</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOC</ENAMEX> spokeswoman, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOC</ENAMEX> has already chosen three demonstration sports, which rank below medal sports, for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barcelona</ENAMEX>: rink hockey, jai alai and tae kwon do. ``It's possible'' that others could be added, she says, but points out that board sports such as billiards and chess are ``a long way off. A very long way.''
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkisson</ENAMEX>, whose husband once played professionally, says the chances might be brighter in 1996 if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, a strong contender, sponsors the Games. An American organizing committee may look favorably on an American proposal.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkisson</ENAMEX> sees one thing on their side: ``There's nothing you can do to adulterate'' a billiards player. ``Steroids don't make any difference.
