The stock price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX> is expected to plummet when a three-week trading halt ends tomorrow after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s disclosure that its alleged fraud-related write-offs will total # 185 million ($297.9 million) after tax.
On Friday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> defense electronics company said a special audit has ``convinced'' its board that it was ``the victim of a serious fraud'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal & Control</ENAMEX>, with which it merged last year. That company's books, it said, included nonexistent weapons contracts that inflated its reported assets. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correcting Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s own accounts, the company said, will mean a profit restatement.
In an interview, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> Chairman Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Alun-Jones</ENAMEX> said company lawyers are considering action to recover damages. He said he is continuing efforts to seek a buyer for all or part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> and that he expects this week to prepare a list of three or four companies with which to intensify partnership talks. He declined to name them, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> analysts speculated that they include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace PLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siemens AG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> statement ``is very bleak reading,'' said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles Saltiel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoare Govett Ltd.</ENAMEX> But forecasting market reaction will be difficult: Though the writeoffs have nearly halved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s net worth to # 196.9 million, speculation about the price and timing of any merger would help buoy the stock price, analysts said.
Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek</ENAMEX> declined to identify suspects in the alleged fraud. But transactions involving the U.S. unit's former chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Guerin</ENAMEX>, are being investigated by U.S. agencies for compliance with export-license requirements and other laws. Friday's Ferranti statement said the books of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal</ENAMEX> unit had reported ``sales contracts and subcontracts which didn't in reality exist, {and} which led to the removal of money from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISC Group</ENAMEX> in the guise of payments to purported subcontractors.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guerin</ENAMEX>, in statements issued by his attorney, has denied any wrongdoing. His attorney couldn't be reached for comment over the weekend.
