<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Corp.</ENAMEX> said it sold its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">F.N. Thompson Inc.</ENAMEX> construction subsidiary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polar Construction Corp.</ENAMEX>, a Finnish construction company, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BE&K Inc.</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alabama</ENAMEX> construction concern.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX>, a general builder, said the sale would have ``a modest positive impact'' on earnings. The unit, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, was acquired in 1979.
A spokeswoman said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> also owns a subsidiary, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, ``that covers that area fairly well.'' The sale ``avoids duplication'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX>'s construction activities, she said.
