<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> may be a heartthrob in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, but in this town he gives his neighbors heartburn.
``He's a jerk,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penny Larson</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heber City</ENAMEX> hardware-store clerk.
``The people in general are disgusted with him,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Ferrell</ENAMEX>, a power-company executive.
``Probably the most hated man in this county,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonni Schwinn</ENAMEX>, a reporter for the weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wasatch (County</ENAMEX>) Wave.
What does the actor himself say? ``They'd like to lynch me,'' he admits as he munches a turkey sandwich on a patio at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundance Ski Resort</ENAMEX> a few miles south of town.
The animosity centers on his long opposition to improving a treacherous 27-mile strip of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Route 189 winding south through Provo Canyon, past Sundance and on to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Provo</ENAMEX>, where most <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heber City</ENAMEX> residents work, shop and worship.
Built atop an old logging road, the narrow, two-lane highway clings to the canyon's steep silver-blue walls as it weaves above the swift Provo River. In winter, ice makes its dozens of blind curves especially dangerous. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heber City</ENAMEX> resident <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ila Hulse</ENAMEX>'s mother was among the 38 people killed on the highway since 1972. ``I think all of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heber</ENAMEX> blames <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX>,'' she says.
For nearly 20 years, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> has been trying to cut a wider, straighter four-lane highway through the canyon. For almost that long, the environmentalist-actor has tried to stop the bulldozers from chomping up any of the landscape, which includes a world-class trout stream and rock formations that are photographed for textbooks.
Amid the bitter local criticism, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> two years ago backed down and got behind a less intrusive highway plan. Construction could start as early as next year.
But many locals haven't forgiven him. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>, sagebrush conservatives belittle his liberal politics, developers grouse about his environmental stance, and descendants of the Mormon pioneers are suspicious of an outsider with so much money and clout. When a Soviet-American environmental conference that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> arranged at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundance</ENAMEX> drew headlines around the world last month, it spawned only grumbling among some of his neighbors.
The state originally proposed building a broader highway in the late 1960s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heber City</ENAMEX> residents were ecstatic. However, some Provo residents near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham Young University</ENAMEX> protested that it would dump more big trucks into their neighborhoods, and environmentalists complained about damage to the canyon. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX>, who became the project's best-known opponent, helped organize some Provo students for a protest march to the governor's office.
The highway plan was delayed because of budget problems and because the state had to do studies to answer environmental issues raised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX>. ``He was just very loud in saying that this road shouldn't be improved,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> aide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sammye Meadows</ENAMEX>. But after public hearings indicated that most local residents wanted some sort of improvement, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> began working on a compromise plan. ``It was a bitter pill to swallow,'' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meadows</ENAMEX>. ``But that's what the public wanted. We decided that if we continued to push we would likely lose everything.''
Besides helping organize a committee that included environmentalists, local politicians and state highway officials, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> made some television commercials telling people they could have a new highway without ruining the canyon. The result is a new plan, apparently destined for adoption, that provides for a four-lane highway generally following the canyon's contours and avoiding the river.
Though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> now is being lauded by some officials who once opposed him, he is still seen as ``the outside guy with money,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Rushforth</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham Young botanist.</ENAMEX> ``Whenever there is an environmental issue, people say it's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Redford</ENAMEX> causing trouble. He gets beat up for a lot of stuff that isn't his.''
Many residents refuse to forgive his battle in the early 1970s against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern California Edison Co.</ENAMEX>'s plan for a huge coal-fired power plant on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaiparowits</ENAMEX> plateau in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>, a rugged area that is considered as different from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Provo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> as upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> is from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Apple.</ENAMEX> Besides creating hundreds of construction jobs, the utility said, the plant would be a boon to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> coal miners.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> galvanized the opposition. Interviewed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s ``60 Minutes,'' he complained about the environmental impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Canyon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lake Powell</ENAMEX>. After the project was canceled, residents in the small southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> town of Kanab burned him in effigy. ``He and other extreme environmentalists want to prevent any economic development in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>,'' complains <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calvin Black</ENAMEX>, a county commissioner from the area. ``They always want to impose their values on where they don't live.''
Such environmentalist-developer struggles are roiling much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, of course, with the issues ranging from protection of woodpecker habitats in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> to clear-cutting of forests in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> state. Symbolizing the struggle are people like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> native, he first motorcycled through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wasatch Mountains</ENAMEX> as a college student in the 1950s. After marrying a Provo native in 1961, he bought two acres on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Timpanogos</ENAMEX> and built a small home. As his acting career and financial resources grew, he built a bigger house and bought more land. Eventually, he bought the local ski resort, now known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sundance</ENAMEX>.
By clearing land to build cottages, restaurants and meeting halls, he himself became a developer, albeit one whose buildings blended into the landscape and who replaced the trees that he cut down. He also established a respected film institute where young actors, dancers, playwrights and film composers could mix with seasoned professionals.
He has helped an equally rare breed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>, contributing to the political campaigns of liberal and moderate Democrats. ``As much as you admire him as a movie star, you still can't forget that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Utah</ENAMEX> doesn't back liberals,'' says one Utah congressional aide. But when Republican Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Bargerter</ENAMEX>, whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> had opposed, held a 1987 conference of Western governors, he took them to Sundance to hobnob with the star.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> meanwhile has carried on some quiet diplomacy. In 1983, he formed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sundance</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute of Resource Management</ENAMEX>, which tries to resolve thorny environmental issues through negotiation. The institute quietly persuaded the heads of several environmental groups and major oil companies to negotiate an agreement on drilling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bering Sea</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> in 1986, though the pact was later scuttled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior Department</ENAMEX>.
For last month's conference, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> and the institute invited luminaries such as scientist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Sagan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> anchorman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Brokaw</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bradley</ENAMEX> to Sundance to confer with a delegation of Soviet politicians and scientists about threats to the global climate. The session produced a communique to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and Soviet President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> on the danger of global warming.
But readers called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provo Daily Herald</ENAMEX> to question why the paper was covering anything associated with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX>. One wanted to know how he could talk about saving forests when he had cut down trees to build a resort.
``Every time I speak up, there's a counterforce that builds up,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> says with a grimace. He has tried to tamp down that ``counterforce'' by staying out of the spotlight on most environmental issues.
He nevertheless is quietly keeping up the sort of pressure that has made him a pariah among some of his neighbors. For years, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> has said its growth will require water from the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jordonelle</ENAMEX> Reservoir project. Now, with dam construction under way, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> is raising questions about the impact on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Provo River</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundance group</ENAMEX> has also joined other environmentalists in complaining about air pollution from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geneva Steel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>, one of the area's largest employers. On that issue, at least, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redford</ENAMEX> is making certain that neighbors can't complain that he doesn't practice what he preaches: The wood-burning fireplaces in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sundance</ENAMEX> cottages are being fitted for fuel-efficient enclosures.
