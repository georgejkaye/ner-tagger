As it marks its 75th birthday in its usual understated style, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> will soon find itself the focus of unwanted attention: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is gearing up for unusually close scrutiny of the powerful institution.
Hearings will be held on two bills that would crimp the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s fierce independence in quite different ways, with both measures sponsored by congressmen who insist the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s recent record is superb. Although these bills aren't given much chance of passing, they are bound to leave an imprint. Their sponsors intend to use the hearings to beam a spotlight on a corner of the government that generally hides from public view and, in the process, to influence future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> policy.
One bill would require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to eliminate inflation, now in the 4 1/2%-5% range, by 1994. The other would add the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary to the autonomous 12-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> committee that manipulates short-term interest rates.
Criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> always appeals to the populist streak in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hamilton</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>), sponsor of the second bill, insists he isn't out to hurt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>, only to help it better coordinate policy with the administration. But he traces his interest in reforming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to complaints from constituents during the deep recession of the early 1980s. ``They say,'I don't like what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> does.' I say,'The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> doesn't really control the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.' They say,'Who does?' I say,'Well, nobody does.'''
One of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s best friends in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Neal</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>), will oversee the hearings and prevent them from turning into unrestrained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>-bashing. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> monetary-policy subcommittee, acknowledges that his no-inflation bill serves as a useful counterweight to proposals less friendly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
Aides to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gonzalez</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>) -- who once called for abolishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> -- say he no longer plans to hold hearings of his own on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> this year, but he's certain to participate actively in the subcommittee hearings. And he also has commissioned a staff study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s structure and ways to rein it in.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>, veterans recall that stormy hearings conducted 25 years ago by the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> Patman when he was chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> didn't produce any significant legislation. The prospect of a new round of hearings is seen more as a nuisance than a threat.
The deceptively simple proposal advanced by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX> would write into law that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s chief mission is to eliminate inflation. This, he argues, would yield the maximum rate of economic growth in the long run. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> basically agrees. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX> would try to make him deliver, although his bill doesn't include any penalties should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> fail to eliminate inflation.
Current law instructs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> ``to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.'' It says nothing about the trade-offs among those objectives. In fact, it's so broad that Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX> complains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> can honestly claim to be fulfilling the will of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, regardless of what policy the central bank happens to be pursuing.
He also figures that reducing inflation would be almost painless. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> might have to raise short-term interest rates for a while to yank down the inflation rate, he concedes. But he claims that that would be offset by an almost immediate drop in interest rates once financial markets understood that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> were serious about eradicating inflation.
That isn't the view of many economists -- or of other members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. ``It's not hard to hit zero inflation,'' says Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Economic Committee</ENAMEX>. ``But it hurts to do it.'' By raising interest rates high enough, he suggests, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> could cause a recession and bring down inflation as it did in the early 1980s.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> itself would welcome the no-inflation goal, accustomed as it is to politicians calling for easier credit policy rather than a tough, anti-inflation stance. Indeed, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> last week gave his support to Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX>'s bill, after convincing him to make some changes.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX>'s original legislation had a rigid formula, calling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to reduce inflation by ``one percent a year'' until it had reached ``zero.'' The new version, introduced last week, simply calls for the ``elimination'' of inflation in five years. And it paraphrases language used by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> in congresssional testimony, saying that ``inflation will be deemed to be eliminated when the expected rate of change of the general level of prices ceases to be a factor in individual and business decision making.''
Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Proxmire</ENAMEX>, though sympathetic to Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal</ENAMEX>'s objectives, says: ``It's best to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> alone. I don't think there should be more administration and congressional influence. I think there should be less.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> and its friends are distinctly unhappy with the bill offered by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Dorgan</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.D.</ENAMEX>) that would restore the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s policy-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market Committee</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary was booted off in a 1936 New Deal restructuring of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>, and subsequent efforts to restore his seat or otherwise reshape the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> have gone nowhere.
To central bankers, the ideal is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> that plots its course with no interference from elected officials. ``We're all in favor of accountability,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Solomon</ENAMEX>, who has served as president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and undersecretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>. ``These proposals really represent a political intrusion into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> rather than accountability.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proxmire</ENAMEX> calls the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX> proposal ``the most dangerous economic legislation before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.'' Politicians always favor easy money and low interest rates, and that means more inflation, he reasons. ``You need the discipline of people who can take the long-term view,'' he insists.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> argues that his bill is far more modest than the reaction suggests. ``I'm not out to gut the independence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>,'' he says. ``But putting the secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> on the open-market committee, you certainly don't hand over control of monetary policy to the president.''
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>,'' he says, ``doesn't fit the usual rules of accountability that we have in a democratic society.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s budget isn't subject to congressional scrutiny; his bill would alter that. Monetary policy is set by seven <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> governors appointed by the president for 14-year terms and the presidents of five regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> banks who are appointed by boards composed of businessmen and bankers. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> would give each president the power to name a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> met with Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> recently to discuss his bill. He won't talk about the meeting, but he says that while some people see his bill ``as a threat to the independence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> and to monetary policy, I don't intend it to be either. I'm not trying to bring down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. I'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> basher.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> says, has been doing ``a very good job'' managing the economy.
But he asks: ``Does everything have to be broken before we try to improve it?''
