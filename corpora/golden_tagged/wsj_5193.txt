Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe Gonzalez</ENAMEX> may not have planned things this way, but a decision by his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmen Romero</ENAMEX>, to run for the Spanish Parliament in next month's elections has sparked a storm.
As third on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Party</ENAMEX>'s list of candidates in the province of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cadiz</ENAMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romero</ENAMEX>, a 42-year-old former teacher who -- like all married Spanish women -- retains her maiden name, is practically certain to be elected.
But the prospect of what could turn out to be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>'s first husband-and-wife political team since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferdinand of Aragon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isabella of Castile</ENAMEX> in the 15th century has met a mixed welcome.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX>, charged the opposition newspaper ABC, drawing parallels between Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romero</ENAMEX>'s candidacy and the roles once played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imelda Marcos</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabel Martinez de Peron</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>, ``governs <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> as if it were a banana republic.''
``The idea {of her candidacy} hasn't been presented well,'' commented sociologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amando de Miguel</ENAMEX>. Though it may win votes locally, he added, ``it gives a rather Third World, paternalist view of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>.''
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romero</ENAMEX>'s candidacy, leaked to the media last week, hasn't yet been officially rubber-stamped by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Party</ENAMEX>.
But officials said it is certain to get approval later this month, as part of a drive to ensure that at least 25% of Socialist candidates are women.
Assuming Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romero</ENAMEX> is approved, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>'s electoral system means she can hardly fail to get elected. Seats in the 350-seat Parliament are allotted, on the basis of proportional representation, to closed lists of party candidates in 52 provinces; in the last poll in 1986 the first seven on the Socialist list won election in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cadiz</ENAMEX>.
Despite her personal charm and credentials as a former union activist and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Party</ENAMEX> member since 1968, the Socialist premier's wife may not have an easy time out on the stump.
She has no direct connections with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cadiz</ENAMEX>, where she will be up against candidates such as the populist mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pedro Pacheco</ENAMEX>.
``What seemed like a brilliant electoral trick... could turn out to be counterproductive,'' wrote columnist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abel Hernandez</ENAMEX> in the newspaper Diario 16.
