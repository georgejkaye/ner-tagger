A major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> newspaper reported that a Japanese department store concern is planning to offer about $1.3 billion to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>, the chain's owner, declined to comment on the report.
A spokeswoman said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> has received ``expressions of interest'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nihon Keizai Shimbun</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s leading economic newspaper, reported Wednesday that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyu Department Store Co.</ENAMEX> is planning to team up with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western European</ENAMEX> financing to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based retail chain, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> has put up for sale. The service didn't identify its Tokyu sources.
``This is the first of many rumors we expect to hear during the sale's process,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale's</ENAMEX> spokesman. ``We won't comment on them.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyu</ENAMEX> executives weren't available for comment early Thursday morning in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX>, said at its annual meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> that he valued <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s at $2 billion. Among previously disclosed possible bidders is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Traub</ENAMEX>, who has aligned himself with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX> bankers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyu Department</ENAMEX> Store is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a management committee headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Traub</ENAMEX>. But they said detailed financial figures haven't been passed yet to any prospective buyers.
``Nobody is going to make a real bid before the middle of November,'' said one investment banker familiar with the discussions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyu</ENAMEX> is one of the potential buyers who might raise its hand. But it's in very early stages still.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s is a 17-store chain acquired last year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> in its $6.6 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s does an estimated $1.2 billion in annual sales.
The sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s is a condition of efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX> to arrange $800 million in bridge financing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, which disclosed last month that its retailing units, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied Stores Corp.</ENAMEX>, were strapped for cash. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reichmann</ENAMEX> family, is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based real estate and retailing company.
One executive familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s situation said, ``No book has been issued regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, there are no projections, so I doubt very much whether any bid has been made.''
Separately, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> shareholder filed suit, charging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX> and other officers with violating securities law.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, seeks class-action status. The suit accuses the retailer and several of its officers of making false and misleading statements about the company's business affairs. The suit says the company failed to disclose material adverse information about its financial condition.
A spokesman for the company said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> hasn't seen the suit and declined to comment.
