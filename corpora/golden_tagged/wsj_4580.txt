Need a second-hand refrigerator? Maybe a used counter top, calculator or desk? Better yet, a robot or fire truck?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob Fittro</ENAMEX> sells it all, everything the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck & Co.</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Point</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, doesn't need anymore. Like lots of other companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> is discovering there's gold in corporate garbage.
Last year, the first for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fittro</ENAMEX>'s program, he sold $500,000 of surplus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX> supplies to wholesalers, retailers and other drug companies. This year, he expects to move $1.5 million to $2 million of goods out of a 30,000 square-foot warehouse.
Selling off what might have been thrown out means ``getting that final return on your investment,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Wenberg</ENAMEX>, the ``investment recovery'' manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wenberg</ENAMEX> has sold $12 million of surplus Phillips goods in the first eight months of this year, up from $11 million for all of 1988 and $7 million for 1987. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips</ENAMEX> first tries to reuse discarded or surplus items somewhere else inside the company. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck</ENAMEX>, what it can't reuse it sells directly to the public, opening its ``showroom'' -- a 66,000 squarefoot warehouse -- one day every other month. Earlier this month, 3,000 people showed up at its store, buying $60,000 of goods in five hours.
``The beauty of it is, it all goes directly to the bottom line,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wenberg</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX> recovery does have its headaches. Department managers say they are constantly having to convince skeptical senior executives that their operations will be profitable. Senior officials, they say, frequently ask where buyers will come from, although investment-recovery managers say they are abundant. And other department heads often have to be begged or bullied into sending their castoff supplies to the investment-recovery department rather than to a garbage bin.
More than 200 major U.S. companies now belong to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment Recovery Association</ENAMEX>, a nine-year-old organization based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>. That membership is up 54% from four years ago.
In 1988, according to a new recovery association survey, the 93 member companies that responded sold a total $285.5 million of surplus goods at their corporate garage sales. In addition, the same companies avoided spending a total $157.6 million by reusing old equipment and leftover raw materials.
Among 12 giant companies with annual sales of $4 billion to $7 billion, the association says the average 1988 return (both sales and avoided costs) was $7.4 million, while the average recovery-program budget was just $496,550. Among 14 small companies with less than $1 billion in sales, the average return totaled $1.2 million and the average program cost a mere $53,079.
The value of such a program is actually even higher because it cuts down on garbage-disposal costs. Indeed, many companies say they are starting investment-recovery programs because of rapidly rising disposal costs brought on by an ever-worsening landfill shortage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
``You just can't dump stuff like you used to,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fittro</ENAMEX>.
Companies with large capital-equipment needs, plus businesses whose excess raw materials can pose an environmental hazard, dominate the investment-recovery field. Electric utilities lead the way, followed by chemical, forest products, petroleum, food and computer concerns.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co.</ENAMEX>, which has one of the most extensive programs, investment-recovery manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.G. Shaver</ENAMEX> boasts he can recycle just about anything.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaver</ENAMEX>'s 15-member department includes two specialists who sell surplus manufacturing equipment to other companies and brokers. He also has three commodity specialists who sell chemicals and solvents, plastics and resins, metals and waste paper. And every November 3M holds a clearance sale of lower-value manufacturing equipment. Last year's take at that event: nearly $300,000.
All told, in 1988 Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaver</ENAMEX>'s department generated $34.5 million in sales, up from $10 million five years ago. At the same time, 3M avoided having to spend another $30 million on new equipment and supplies. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaver</ENAMEX>'s department accounted for 3.7% of 3M's 1988 domestic pretax profit, or nine cents in the corporate per-share earnings of $5.09. So far this year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaver</ENAMEX> says his department is running about 30% ahead of 1988.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mead Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, the focus is on surplus mill equipment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosalie Vance</ENAMEX>, engineering-services administrator, is a one-man band, seeking first to transfer old equipment to other Mead paper mills. She does this by ``advertising'' to 25 or so plant managers. If they aren't interested, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> solicits 500 or so potential equipment buyers, half of them dealers. ``I'm a bulletin board,'' she says, adding that even a limited-scale program like hers is ``very profitable,'' returning $10 or so for every dollar spent.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mead</ENAMEX> illustrates another advantage of investment recovery: For industries that are expanding, as the paper industry is right now, lead times on new equipment orders can run as long as three years. Readily available old equipment can either fill the need temporarily or, with some refurbishing, eliminate the need to order new, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vance</ENAMEX> and others say.
Other companies with active programs include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Telecommunications Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frito</ENAMEX>-Lay unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> has found a ready market for its outdated analog switching equipment among small telephone companies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frito-Lay</ENAMEX> has stressed reusing equipment not just within the division but also at Pizza <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taco Bell</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX> units. Ovens, fryers and blenders, for instance, are always in demand.
Then there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weyerhaeuser Co.</ENAMEX>, whose 15-year-old investment-recovery program, one of the granddaddies, has evolved into a full-fledged retailing operation. The company has two stores open to the public, one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Olympia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, and one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wilson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX> To keep them chock-a-block with used lumbering equipment and other gear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> even buys other companies' surplus goods. The timber products company recently sold the Venezuelan government an entire plywood plant made up of 30% old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> equipment and 70% equipment bought from other manufacturers.
This year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> stores will gross about $12 million, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Knutz</ENAMEX>, the company's investment-recovery manager. Besides chain saws and such, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weyerhaeuser</ENAMEX> sells trains, planes, automobiles, trucks and recently a 500,000-ton cargo ship. While there are no helicopters in stock right now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knutz</ENAMEX> is quick to say, ``I can get you one. Cheap
