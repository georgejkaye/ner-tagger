The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> banned all imports of mushrooms from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms.
``The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>,'' an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> spokesman said yesterday. The agency won't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> until ``satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> to prevent'' bacterial contamination.
On May 19, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> became ill from eating tainted mushrooms. In subsequent tests, the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated.
The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables. A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March.
In 1987, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms, valued at $47 million, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants.
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> government has taken ``many effective measures'' to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes. He predicted the problem will be solved ``very soon.
