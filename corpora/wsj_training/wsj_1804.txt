<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitbread & Co.</ENAMEX> put its spirits division up for sale, triggering a scramble among global groups for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British company</ENAMEX>'s brands.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> already has been approached by ``about half a dozen'' companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business, a spokesman said. Analysts expect the spirits operations and some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about # 500 million ($788.8 million).
Among the brands for sale are Beefeater gin, the No. 2 imported gin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and Laphroaig single-malt whiskey. Also for sale are Buckingham <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wile Co.</ENAMEX>, which distributes Cutty <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sark</ENAMEX> blended whiskey in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX>'s Atlas Peak <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vineyards</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley</ENAMEX>.
Beefeater alone is worth as much as # 300 million, analysts said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for # 174.5 million.
That purchase represented an attempt by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX>, a venerable British brewer, to become a major player in the global liquor business. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry. Now, it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations.
For rival liquor companies, the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands. ``It's not very often something like this comes up,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Littleboy</ENAMEX>, a liquor company analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Research Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
``The division will be sold off quite rapidly,'' predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neill Junor</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> brokers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Natwest Woodmac</ENAMEX>. Among possible buyers, Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX> might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio. Grand Met owns <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bombay</ENAMEX> gin, the No. 3 imported gin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>; rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness PLC</ENAMEX> has the No. 1 imported brand, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanqueray</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> spirits auction ``is an extremely interesting development... and naturally we'll be considering it carefully,'' a Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness</ENAMEX>, which owns several leading whiskey brands plus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX>'s gin, the world's No. 1 gin, is considered less likely to bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> spirits. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guinness</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment.
Two other global liquor giants, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied-Lyons PLC</ENAMEX>, also are possible buyers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX>'s gin is the world's No. 2 gin brand, but the company doesn't own any of the major gin brands imported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allied-Lyons</ENAMEX>, while powerful in whiskey, doesn't own any major white-spirit brands. ``We will certainly have to take a look at'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> spirits business, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied-Lyons</ENAMEX> spokesman said. ``We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio.'' A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment.
Smaller liquor companies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown-Forman Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Brands Inc.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, also are likely to be interested. Such companies ``are increasingly being left behind'' in the global liquor business, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Littleboy</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Brands</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown-Forman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX> distiller, also declined to comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX>'s wine, spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of # 35.4 million on sales of # 315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25. The company, which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests, didn't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell. But analysts estimate their trading profit at # 30 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of # 223.2 million, on sales of # 2.26 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX>'s spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry. Earlier this year, the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry. British brewers currently own thousands of pubs, which in turn sell only the breweries' beer and soft drinks. Under new rules, many of the country's pubs would become ``free houses,'' selling beers of their choice.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> now intends to bolster its brewing interests, in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses. The company, which last month paid # 50.7 million for regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British brewer Boddington Group PLC</ENAMEX>, has about 13% of the British beer market. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> also owns the license to brew and distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heineken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stella Artois</ENAMEX> beers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> intends to focus on its newer hotel, liquor store and restaurant businesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico Inc.</ENAMEX> of the country's Pizza <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hut</ENAMEX> chain. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> owns The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keg</ENAMEX> chain of steak and seafood restaurants.
Focusing on beer, restaurants and hotels means ``we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Jarvis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX>'s managing director, said in a statement. The spirits business ``would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitbread</ENAMEX> also announced that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarvis</ENAMEX>, who is 48, will become the company's chief executive March 1. At that time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Whitbread</ENAMEX>, the company's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder, will retire from executive duties. He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman.
