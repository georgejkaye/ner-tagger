When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mcduffie</ENAMEX> was 14, he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX> Unfortunately, his mother had tickets for a recital by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Itzhak Perlman</ENAMEX> the same night, and she was adamant about his attending. ``I threw such a fit,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX>, who had begun violin studies at the age of six. ``But once <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perlman</ENAMEX> started playing, I didn't give a damn about basketball.... Afterwards, I went home and practiced for three hours.''
Today, it's obvious that the brawny, six-foot, one-inch musician made the right choice. At 31, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX> has a rich, full-bodied tone, an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule. He's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yehudi Menuhin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw Sinfonia</ENAMEX>, with stops including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX> (Oct. 25), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sarasota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX> (Oct. 28), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla</ENAMEX>. (Oct. 29) and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> (Oct. 31). Later this season he gives a recital at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kennedy Center</ENAMEX>, and appears as soloist with several major orchestras.
Yet Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX>'s career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries. During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical ``brat pack'' -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juilliard School</ENAMEX> with the noted pedagogue <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorothy Delay</ENAMEX>. His violin classmates included Shlomo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mintz</ENAMEX>, a protege of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Stern</ENAMEX> who performed with major orchestras while still a student; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cho-Liang Lin</ENAMEX>, who joined the roster of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM Artists Inc.</ENAMEX> at the age of 18; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg</ENAMEX>, who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition.
``I thought I was over the hill at 22,'' recalls Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX>, an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl. ``But I wasn't ready for a career at that time.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young Mcduffie</ENAMEX>'s first violin teacher was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henrik Schwarzenberger</ENAMEX>, a Hungarian refugee who taught in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macon</ENAMEX> public school system. ``He taught me how to play like a gypsy,'' jokes the musician. ``I didn't learn to count until I got to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juilliard.</ENAMEX>'' After studies at that conservatory's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pre-College Division</ENAMEX> with an assistant to the legendary instructor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Galamian</ENAMEX>, he switched at the college level to Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delay</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Galamian</ENAMEX>'s longtime assistant and, ultimately, his rival. ``I think I had to prove myself to her,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX>. ``But she was always encouraging. She only put her foot down twice,'' he continues. ``In my freshman year, my roommate was known as a party animal. She thought I wasn't getting my practicing done.'' As the violinist tells it, his grandmotherly looking teacher ``put her hands on her hips, stomped her foot and said, `You've just got to get the {expletive deleted} out of there.'''
The second incident took place after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX> gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself. Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delay</ENAMEX> requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital. ``We listened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chausson `Poeme</ENAMEX>,''' he recalls, ``and she said, `You hear the first note, that B-flat? That's the only note that's truly in tune...'.''
``That's the most important experience I've had with any teacher,'' he says, ``because she taught me how to listen. Now, when I play with orchestras, the musicians often compliment me on my intonation.''
It was also at Juilliard that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX> discovered his predilection for conservative, 20th-century American composers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Diamond</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Barber</ENAMEX>. After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter's ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX> was invited to play the work for the composer, who was dying of cancer.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> was seated by the fireplace looking very pale,'' recalls the violinist, who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer's apartment. ``He didn't say much, but what he said was important because it's not in the score. There's a beautiful, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coplandesque</ENAMEX> motif -- he'd kill me if he heard me say that -- throughout the first movement... The only time the violin has it is right at the end. It's written `marcato' in the score, and I played it that way, kind of gigue-like. And he yelled out `dolce  dolce ' {`sweet sweet '}.''
``So we did it over,'' he adds. ``I played very transparently, with the tip of the bow. If a conductor is sensitive enough to bring down the orchestra {volume} at that point, it makes the piece magical. I don't know why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barber</ENAMEX> never told anybody else. On <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isaac Stern</ENAMEX>'s recording it's very biting.''
Since leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Juilliard</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX> has made some smart moves and some controversial ones. His guest appearance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> soap opera ``Another World,'' scandalized musical elitists. By contrast, he's won kudos for his espousal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Schuman</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX>,'' which he recently recorded for Angel\ along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Bernstein</ENAMEX>'s engaging ``Serenade for Violin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Solo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Percussion.</ENAMEX>''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX>'s sweet tone, heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works. Aided by the fluid playing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Symphony</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Slatkin</ENAMEX>'s direction, this ``Serenade'' really swings. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schuman</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Violin Concerto</ENAMEX>,'' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment, meanders until the propulsive ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agitato</ENAMEX>, fervente.'' But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist, brass and timpani. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avery</ENAMEX> Fisher Hall here, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX> was heard recently with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menuhin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX> Sinfonia in more conventional fare -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruch</ENAMEX>'s overwrought ``Violin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concerto in G Minor.</ENAMEX>'' His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed. The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big, lush sound that belied its size.
Whatever he plays, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcduffie</ENAMEX> finds satisfaction in the music itself -- ``something greater out there than me,'' as he puts it during an interview at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> apartment he shares with wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Camille</ENAMEX>, a literary publicist. ``A normal person did not write the Beethoven `Violin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concerto</ENAMEX>,''' he declares. ``Even when I hear it played badly, I'm still humbled by the piece. If I could ever feel I've contributed to it in some way, then all the hard work has been worth it.''
