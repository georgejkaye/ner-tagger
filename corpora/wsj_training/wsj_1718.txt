The Canadian government introduced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Commons</ENAMEX> legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government-owned telephone utilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manitoba</ENAMEX>.
The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the three provinces, federal officials said.
The federal government initiative follows a recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision that held that the major telephone companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manitoba</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative authority. Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>, British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Territories</ENAMEX>.
The governments of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manitoba</ENAMEX> have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies. The extension of federal regulatory authority over telephone utilities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic provinces</ENAMEX> hasn't required special legislation because they are investor-owned.
