The dollar finished mixed, restrained by an unexpected intervention by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</ENAMEX> and two gatherings that could shape the outlook for the U.S. currency.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Bank Council</ENAMEX> is slated to meet tomorrow, and although an increase in German interest rates isn't widely expected to result, participants are reluctant to risk new positions in case the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> defies predictions, foreign-exchange traders said.
Also, a meeting of finance chiefs from the Group of Seven major industrial countries set for Saturday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> is expected to issue a statement on the dollar that may ruffle an already sensitive market, traders said.
In the meantime, the dollar, which tumbled hard in a rumor-fraught market Friday, isn't likely to post significant gains while participants cautiously probe for a safe trading range, dealers predicted.
``It's going to take some time to get the volatility out of trading,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Mondschein</ENAMEX>, vice president and managing director of foreign exchange at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. Until then, it'll be hard to coax participants who were burned by the dollar's dramatic fall Friday to re-enter the market.
In late afternoon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday, the dollar was at 1.9545 marks, up from 1.9520 marks late Monday, and at 145.85 yen, almost flat from 145.88 yen. Sterling was at $1.5700, about even with $1.5705.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Wednesday, the dollar opened for trading at 146.23 yen, up from Tuesday's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of 145.73 yen.
After sliding in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monday</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading, the dollar began the Asian day on a soft note, with participants wary of intervention by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX>. But as the day wore on and the central bank remained inactive, the dollar crept higher. The U.S. currency continued to nudge higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, shored up by light shortcovering ahead of the release of August U.S. data on consumer prices and housing starts.
When the data showed no increase in consumer prices despite forecasts for a small rise, and a fall in housing starts after calls for a modest gain, the dollar slipped. Participants viewed the slower economic data as increasing chances of renewed interest rate reductions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Fed, traders said.
Lower interest rates generally hurt the domestic currency by reducing the attractiveness of interest-bearing investments denominated in that currency.
The dollar rebounded after a more careful analysis suggested the data alone won't prompt reaction by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. Until U.S. interest rates decline, a lower inflation rate will keep inflation-adjusted yields attractive, dealers noted.
But an intervention by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> caught the market off guard around midday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. Dollar sales by the central bank when the currency was trading at 1.9530 marks knocked the dollar substantially lower and seemed to cap the rise.
Because the dollar wasn't rallying energetically when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> entered the market, many traders were at a loss to explain why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> acted. A few, however, suggested the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> may have been concerned by the market's easy absorption of a coordinated intervention early Friday, when the dollar was rallying, and wanted to ensure support for the U.S. currency didn't build greatly.
The yen continued to display softness. The yen has weakened against the mark in recent days because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> is seen as more likely to raise interest rates in the near future than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s central bank.
Traders noted that the mark's gains against its Japanese counterpart may quickly erode if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> indicates it isn't eager to raise rates soon. Such an indication may follow tomorrow's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Bank Council</ENAMEX> meeting.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, gold for current delivery settled at $361.20 an ounce, down 50 cents. Estimated volume was a light 2.1 million ounces.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Wednesday, gold was quoted at $360.25 an ounce.
