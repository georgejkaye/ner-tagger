<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines Inc.</ENAMEX> is talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX> about forming a joint computer reservation system that could become a significant new competitor for domestic travel-agency bookings.
The move is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>'s second try at improving its standing in the computer reservation business. Earlier this summer, the government effectively quashed on antitrust grounds a plan under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> would have merged its existing system with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sabre</ENAMEX> reservation system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX>, No. 1 in the business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> is the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>.
The control of computer reservation systems is considered a big advantage in the airline industry. The systems, which travel agents use to book airline, car-rental, hotel and other reservations, can generate substantial fees. Industry experts say the systems also tend to create more bookings for the airlines owning them.
The latest venture proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> would operate autonomously with its own management, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>'s brief announcement. Beyond that, none of the companies would discuss what form the transaction would take.
Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX>, jointly operate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARS</ENAMEX>, the industry's fourth-largest reservation system. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delta</ENAMEX>'s system, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Datas II</ENAMEX>, is in fifth place.
``What we see is a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Datas II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARS</ENAMEX>, resulting in a strong third company that's a more effective competitor for the two big systems, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Covia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sabre</ENAMEX>,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> spokesman. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covia</ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Inc.</ENAMEX> and several other carriers, is the second-largest system.
A combined PARS-Datas II system would place it neck-and-neck with third-place Systemone, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delta</ENAMEX> was forced to give up its effort to combine its system with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabre</ENAMEX> last June after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> said it would fight any merger of the systems. A merger of Sabre with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>'s system would have given the two about 46% of the domestic travel-agency market.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>, which can make recommendations on airline mergers, also raised objections in May to the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> transaction. It said the two airlines should include other partners in the new company.
Although at least three smaller airlines said they were interested, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> still said it would sue.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delta</ENAMEX> was to have paid $650 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> for the right to buy half of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sabre</ENAMEX>. An interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PARS</ENAMEX> isn't as valuable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA</ENAMEX> paid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> $140 million for a 50% share in 1986. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> would have to pay roughly $125 million for a one-third share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARS</ENAMEX>, analysts estimate.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delta</ENAMEX>'s bringing something to the table,'' said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Pettee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX>. ``It's not like they don't have anything to contribute. It's Datas II system and not just cash.''
In addition to providing travel agents with back-office assistance, computer reservations systems enable them to make reservations on any major carrier. But the airlines operating the systems possess an edge, industry experts contend, because of so-called architectural biases in the software.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>'s Datas II system is considered technologically competitive with other computer reservation systems, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>'s late start in designing and marketing the system put it at a disadvantage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delta</ENAMEX>, unable to increase its base of 3,500 travel agents by winning them from rival systems, finally turned to the merger route last January with the unsuccessful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> proposal.
