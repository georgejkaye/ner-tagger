<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Penn</ENAMEX>, the 17-year-old former crack dealer and street gang member whose attempted rehabilitation was featured in a front page Wall Street Journal story Sept. 8, has been charged with three misdemeanor offenses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha City</ENAMEX> Prosecutor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bucchino</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penn</ENAMEX> was arrested Monday following a scuffle with several youths in a parking lot. He was charged with one count each of possession of an unregisterd firearm, discharging a projectile within city limits, and being a minor in possession of a firearm.
The first two charges carry penalties of as much as $500 in fines and six months in jail each. The third offense carries a fine of as much as $100 and six months in jail. Trial is set for Oct. 11.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Gray</ENAMEX>, a TV producer at station KETV in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>, who had tried to rescue Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penn</ENAMEX> from a life of crime, said the youth took one of his assailants' guns and fired in self defense after being accosted by former gang members angry at his renunciation of gang life. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> conceded that, after being taunted, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penn</ENAMEX> threw the first punch.
``We're hoping that they drop the charges, out of self defense,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX>. But he added, ``I'm afraid that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> is not going to win at this.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Winkler</ENAMEX>, news director at television station <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KETV</ENAMEX>, where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penn</ENAMEX> had a summer job, said that until the youth's legal status is determined, the station will no longer employ him. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert</ENAMEX> is an extremely bright young man,'' he said. ``Not all kids can be saved. But to the extent that you can help, you've done something remarkable.
