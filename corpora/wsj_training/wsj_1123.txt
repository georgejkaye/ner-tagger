Blue-chip advertisers have plenty of complaints about the magazines they advertise in, ranging from inadequate consumer research to ad ``clutter'' and a seemingly unchecked proliferation of special interest magazines.
Criticism from such big advertisers as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estee Lauder Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram Co.</ENAMEX> put a damper on the euphoria at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Magazine Conference</ENAMEX> here. The conference opened Monday with glowing reports about consumer magazines' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in the past year.
``Magazines are not providing us in-depth information on circulation,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar Bronfman Jr.</ENAMEX>, president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seagram</ENAMEX>, in a panel discussion. ``How do readers feel about the magazine? How deeply do they read it? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research</ENAMEX> doesn't tell us whether people actually do read the magazines they subscribe to.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reuben Mark</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate-Palmolive</ENAMEX>, said advertisers lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of magazines' audiences. ``We need research that convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader's lives, that readers are really involved.''
The critics also lambasted the magazine industry for something executives often are very proud of: the growth in magazine titles during the 1980s. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Lauder</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estee Lauder</ENAMEX>, said consumer magazines are suffering from what he called ``niche-itis,``the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers.
``Niche-itis fragments our advertising dollars,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauder</ENAMEX>. ``We are being over-magazined. We are constantly faced with deciding which partnerships {with magazines} we can keep.'' He added: ``There's probably even a magazine for left-handed golfers... but the general interest magazine is something we all miss, and it should come back.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauder</ENAMEX> also attacked what he sees as the wide imitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elle</ENAMEX>, a fashion magazine published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamandis Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, and criticized the practice of stacking ads at the front of magazines. ``Readers don't want to face all those ad pages at the front of a magazine,'' he said.
Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down. ``We spend a fortune on research information,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Burzon</ENAMEX>, publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meredith Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Home.</ENAMEX>
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Brown</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conde Nast Publications Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX>, said advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter. ``But advertisers wouldn't think of it,'' she said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Leser</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conde Nast</ENAMEX>, added: ``Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues... because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for.
