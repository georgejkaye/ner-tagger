The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Mine Workers</ENAMEX> union was ordered to pay $3.4 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston Co.</ENAMEX> for being violent on the picket line during its five-month strike.
Meanwhile, mine workers have taken over a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX> coal-preparation plant near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dante</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, halting coal shipments from that site, one of the company's largest. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX> members termed the occupation a peaceful sit-in, while company officials say the union members ``seized the plant.''
The $3.4 million fine, ordered by Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Mcglothlin</ENAMEX>, circuit court judge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russell County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, is the first fine to be paid directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, company. However, since the beginning of the strike, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX> has been ordered to pay nearly $27 million in various fines to the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> and two southwestern counties.
The strike follows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX>'s refusal last year to sign the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX>'s industrywide labor contract.
There were about 100 union members and supporters inside the plant, and another 750 outside.
