THANKS TO THE DOLLAR'S relatively strong showing against the yen during the past year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has regained a little ground from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> in the rankings of the world's largest companies and financial institutions.
But Japanese companies still retain the commanding lead they have built up over the past decade. Ranking the world's 100 largest companies by stock-market value, 50 are Japanese this year, down slightly from 53 a year earlier. That includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Telegraph & Telephone</ENAMEX>, the top-ranked company, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, ranked No. 2. By comparison, 35 of the 100 largest companies this year are U.S. concerns, one more than the year before.
Among banks, all of the top eight are Japanese. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> squeaks in at No. 9, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banque National</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> rounds out the top 10. Overall, 31 of the world's 100 largest banks are Japanese; 12 are American. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> have, respectively, 10 and eight banks on the list.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> fares better in the rankings of the world's largest insurance companies and securities firms.
These are some of the findings that emerge in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>'s fourth annual global ranking of companies and financial institutions. The world's 100 largest public companies were monitored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>. Rankings of the 100 largest banks, 50 largest insurers and 25 largest securities firms were compiled from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldscope</ENAMEX> database. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldscope</ENAMEX> is a joint venture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wright Investors Service</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bridgeport</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, and the Center for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Financial Analysis and Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>
The lists generally don't include state-owned entities or some closely held institutions for which data aren't available. In some cases, 1987 data and rankings have been restated.
