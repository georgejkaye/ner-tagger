<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX> negotiated a new debt agreement with its major foreign creditors for about $8 billion of its foreign debt outstanding, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Stals</ENAMEX>, governor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> and the country's chief debt negotiator.
The new agreement will last for 3 1/2 years starting July 1, 1990, when the current agreement expires.
The announcement coincides with the start of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commonwealth Ministers Conference</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>, where proposals for renewed sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>, including moves to block settling of a new debt agreement, were scheduled to be discussed.
As with the previous pact, the new agreement covers the country's debt ``inside the net,'' which applies mainly to repayments due to overseas creditor banks by the private sector.
The agreement calls for South African debtors to make repayments in eight installments, starting in December of next year. The redemption then would be at 1.5% of the total debt, increasing to 2.5% in February 1991, and to 3% at six-month intervals thereafter. A revised provision would be included for the conversion of short-term claims inside the net to long-term loans outside the net. These claims would be repayable over a 10-year period.
Foreign debt falling outside the net of affected indebtedness -- which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stahl</ENAMEX> estimated at $12 billion -- would remain not subject to the debt arrangements.
