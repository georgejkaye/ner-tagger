<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">August A. Busch Jr.</ENAMEX>, the 90-year-old retired head of brewing giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anheuser-Busch Cos.</ENAMEX>, died Friday.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX> controlled a 12.5% stake in the world's largest brewer, and trading in the company's stock was halted pending disclosure of his death.
However, early speculation that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX>'s approximately 35.4 million shares, once they were in the hands of his heirs, might flood the market and depress Anheuser-Busch share price apparently was unfounded. The company said that under a previously approved accord between it and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX> family, the shares can be sold only through an underwritten public secondary offering.
The purpose of the agreement, which was filed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> in 1987, ``is to provide a mechanism for the orderly sale of Anheuser-Busch stock by family members who inherit or receive shares from trust funds previously administered by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch Jr.</ENAMEX>,'' the company said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX> ``fully endorsed'' the agreement, which the company said ``affords maximum protection for all shareholders of Anheuser-Busch stock.''
In composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading Friday, Anheuser-Busch shares ended at $43.375, up $1.125, giving his stake an indicated value of $1.54 billion.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX>, the third generation of his family to head the brewing concern, began his career with the company in 1922. In 1975, he stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer, to be succeeded by his son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">August A. Busch III</ENAMEX>.
