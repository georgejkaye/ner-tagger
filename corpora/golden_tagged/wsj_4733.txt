<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>, in turn, will acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX>'s 25.77% equity interest in Block 210/24A in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern North Sea</ENAMEX> and Block 21/20A in the central sector.

In Block 21/20A, two wells have been drilled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> group showing that the area contains oil. So far, insufficient reserves have been discovered to justify development, but the block has exploration potential, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX> said.
