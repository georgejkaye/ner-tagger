As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> geared up a couple of decades ago to become a trade bloc on the Western scene, the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council for Mutual Economic Assistance</ENAMEX> began presenting itself to the world as its Eastern counterpart. In one sense, that attempt at communist image-making wasn't a total sham. Comecon certainly does block trade.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> might speak, as he recently did in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strasbourg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, of creating ``a vast economic space between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urals.</ENAMEX>'' And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> might speak, as he recently did in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, of creating a Western ``clearinghouse'' of economic aid to the reform communists of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>. But after an East-West estrangement of 40 years, it might well take 40 years more, Cold War or no Cold War, to clean up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX>'s mess and at last put <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> back together again.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Comecon</ENAMEX> (pronounced commie con) was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalin</ENAMEX>'s baby, born in 1949 as his answer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Plan</ENAMEX>. Its purpose in life was to wrench the six newly subjugated countries of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> from their natural trading family in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> and chain them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Empire</ENAMEX>.
Standing colonialism on its head, the Soviets foisted oil and ore on their more-advanced vassals and took home finished goods. It worked beautifully, for the Soviets. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Marer</ENAMEX>, an American specialist on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> economies, figures they milked <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> for $14 billion in the 1950s -- as much as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> got in aid from the U.S.
Obeying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Europeans</ENAMEX> built heavy industry and have lived ever since under its soot cloud. Because Soviet raw  material was cheap, they became masters of waste. Because Soviet standards were low, they became makers of junk. Without real prices or real money, the members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> swapped their crude wares with less know-how than nomads in a 13th-century souk.
They still do. Only now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalin</ENAMEX>'s vacuum-packed empire has popped its lid. Knowing his country can't survive sealed off from capitalism, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> has opened it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>. Nor does he mind if his vassals get to know their Western cousins. But having knocked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>'s door, Comecon can't expect too warm a welcome. The West won't take Comecon seriously until it has something decent to trade. And that won't happen until Comecon turns itself into a serious market.
For its most eager reformers -- the Soviets, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungarians</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poles</ENAMEX> -- rehabilitating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> will prove even harder than making sense of their own ruined economies. The organization runs by consensus, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX>'s other European members -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Romania</ENAMEX> -- still worship the central plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mongolia</ENAMEX> are also members, and they feel the same way. Their refusal to give ground deepens a bitter schism in the Soviet bloc.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarians</ENAMEX> and Poles now talk of quitting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Comecon</ENAMEX>. Or they want it partitioned into camps of planners and marketeers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> may sympathize, but he hardly wants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX>'s unsealing to undo his empire -- not when he still expects <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>'s workers to help pay perestroika's bills.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Comecon</ENAMEX> is a dinosaur trying to find a place in a world that has no need for dinosaurs,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihaly Simai</ENAMEX>, a Hungarian economist who has studied the trade group. The man who oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s trade with the West calls Comecon a ``deadweight.'' ``We have reached the point where trade is a question of life or death,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrzej Olechowski</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>. ``Comecon doesn't give us a window on the world. It doesn't add to our bargaining power. We can think about dropping the whole thing.''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> is just what the commissar ordered. ``We need a strong wall between the world economy and ours,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Heinz Stiemerling</ENAMEX>, a professor of socialist political economy there. ``We have to protect ourselves from the destructive influence of the world market. We won't risk our socialist achievements.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russians</ENAMEX> will. But for all Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s longing to share a ``common European home,'' it isn't nearly so certain that he plans to retire as the dominating landlord. At least one skeptical Pole, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solidarity</ENAMEX> sociologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jadwiga Staniszkis</ENAMEX>, strongly doubts it.
``The system's main interest is to maintain the empire,'' she says. ``This crisis will keep it together, not make it fly apart. To guarantee its survival, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russians</ENAMEX> will give up everything -- except our belonging to them.''
The nations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> are so at odds now that they canceled their last summit and haven't scheduled another one. But nothing puts off Comecon bureaucrats. They go on blocking trade as usual. Every year, they rig a cat's cradle of barter deals vaguely based on world prices (albeit with thousands of different exchange rates fancifully set for different products and commodities) and transacted in the transferable ruble, a whimsical currency that can't be transferred. With oil that Soviet reformers would prefer to ship west, East Europeans fuel outmoded factories they would prefer to scrap. The factories produce hugely subsidized rubbish they can't pawn off on anybody but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russians</ENAMEX>.
The last thing a Comecon dealer wants to end up with in this fantasy land is a trade surplus. In 1986, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> ran one with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> of roughly $4 billion. But when the price of oil dropped, the ink turned red. East Europeans kept swapping the same goods for oil worth less. So in 1988, the $4 billion surplus was theirs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russians</ENAMEX> made up for it in transferable rubles, which won't buy anything anywhere. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>'s surplus thus became a gift to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> for the preservation of perestroika.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protectionism</ENAMEX> reigns in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Comecon</ENAMEX>, too, but in these empty-shelved economies it serves to block exports, not imports. This inverted logic was used last February to hobble the only traders Comecon has who behave rationally: smugglers, black marketeers and tourists.
Liberated to travel abroad, Polish nomads dishing out bribes had been looting the shops of their neighbors for anything short at home. Over the first 10 months of 1988, Soviet customs officers watched 50,000 washing machines, 200,000 refrigerators and 400,000 televisions drain out of the country. To calm their angry consumers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russians</ENAMEX> banned exports of those items, throwing in children's shoes, instant coffee and caviar. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovaks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungarians</ENAMEX> and East Germans followed suit, their customs officers beating up a few Poles in the process. Then the Poles retaliated with export bans of their own.
The immediate effect was the wondrous reappearance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dniepr</ENAMEX> refrigerator in the department stores of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ukraine</ENAMEX>. And across the border, in the Polish city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bialystok</ENAMEX>, the pickings from abroad turned slimmer in the muddy market at the edge of town known to the locals as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevsky Prospect</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television</ENAMEX> sets were scarce there on a cool Saturday earlier this year. They had been replaced by a range of lesser rarities laid out over scraps of plastic on the ground: Russian chocolates, curling irons, cutlery, shower nozzles, juice extractors; plus East German fishing rods, a Czechoslovak carpet, a Turkish fire extinguisher.
``Now that you can't take out much equipment, it's mostly gold I trade,'' said a man in the crowd with a ring on every finger and a sack filled with jewelry around his neck. Past him, three Russians stood in the mud, trying to sell an electric meat grinder.
``It's easy to come over,'' said one. ``We buy jeans here.''
``This works better than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Comecon</ENAMEX>,'' a Pole put in. ``It includes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yugoslavia.</ENAMEX>'' Said his friend: ``We took everything from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> -- now we start on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> ''
Back when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikita Khrushchev</ENAMEX> still thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> would be the one to take everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> did start trying to make sense of itself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khrushchev</ENAMEX> wanted one central plan for the whole bloc. He never got it, or much else.
In 1971, mimicking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Comecon</ENAMEX> drew up the Comprehensive Program for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Socialist Integration</ENAMEX>. Its prospectus noted the utility of two companies in two countries doing business directly, in exchange for money that can actually be spent. It then forgot the whole idea until Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> came along with his Complex Program for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scientific and Technological Cooperation</ENAMEX> Until the Year 2000.
This is a network of 2,000 joint ventures intended to break the state monopoly on foreign trade and simultaneously smash the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>'s lead in high technology. It has failed. A recent Comecon bulletin wondered, with a touch of glasnost, if the 650 projects already completed have boosted economic growth. ``Such an influence can not yet be observed,'' it concluded.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>'s joint ventures seem more like far-flung searches for anything, other than oil, to buy from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. One of them uses supposed Soviet know-how to make semiconductors. Another has Russians digging a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Budapest</ENAMEX> subway. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, several companies on an official list profess not to know that their joint ventures exist.
``It's like marrying kids before they meet,'' says a Pole who has looked into the ventures. ``They don't stimulate the hormones of greed.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Undeterred</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> now has come up with the Collective Concept for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist International Division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Labor</ENAMEX>. Designed to mesh the bloc by assigning restrictive production tasks to each country, this is the identical idea that teed off Romania in 1964. This time, aping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> again, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> pledges to do it in a ``unified'' market. But that's teed off not only Romania again, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>.
Never mind. It won't work anyway. ``They don't know what they're talking about,'' says Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simai</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>. ``How can you have a common market when you don't have a market?''
One answer is to chuck your rubles, forints and zlotys, and do business in dollars. The Soviets and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hungarians</ENAMEX> already use the dollar for nearly a third of their trade. Many a Hungarian also buys his new Lada from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> for marks. Trouble is, nobody in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> wants to squander hard currency in the East when everything worth buying is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>. Cozying up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> makes more sense.
Last year, after seething over it for years, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> finally opted to wink at the status of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Berlin</ENAMEX> in return for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>'s formal recognition. Every member, save <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Romania</ENAMEX>, has since sent an ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, the seat of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>. Though it still won't dicker with Comecon as a bloc, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> has signed separate deals with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, and may do as much with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>.
Comecon reformers are elated. They want to plug into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> power grid, get a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s Eureka high-tech research program and set up as an export platform for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> to conveniently manufacture and ship its wares into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>. And the trade tide is turning. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>'s westward exports rose 20% last year. The Soviets now sell as much to capitalists as they sell to socialists.
From the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, though, the view isn't so stirring. True, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> states and companies are falling over one another (and the Americans and the Japanese) to start joint ventures, train East Bloc managers, advance credit and ease debt. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> still ships less to Comecon than it does to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>. For now, its preoccupation is politics.
When it moved in April to harmonize its Comecon contacts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>'s wary purpose was to let <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> lead the way, without letting it get too far out in front. Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>'s July foray into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, and the rush of Western aid following Solidarity's takeover of the Polish government, making <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> economically whole again remains a matter for some distant date when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comecon</ENAMEX> learns to do business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meantime</ENAMEX>, as always, the people will do it themselves.
A Hungarian sells Polish ham in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>, buys computers, sells computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, buys clothes, sells clothes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>. A Pole sells Russian bedding in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Holland</ENAMEX>, buys computers, sells computers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>, buys pianos, sells pianos in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>.
And, long after the big export clampdown, the private stalls of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX> still stock all the Russian beluga caviar you can eat.
``No Russian law will stop us,'' says a man behind a pile of tins one day. ``I guarantee it. We'll fish for it ourselves if we have to -- but in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX> we will always have caviar.''
