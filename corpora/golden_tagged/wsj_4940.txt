A group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> is expected to step in for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp Venture</ENAMEX> Capital as the buyer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> canned-foods business from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>
An announcement is expected as early as today of the details of the sale, which was revamped after the staff of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> balked at allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> unit to lead the purchase. However, the price of $1.48 billion isn't expected to change.
Federal banking rules bar banks from holding more than 5% of the voting stock and 25% of the non-voting stock in non-financial companies. But some banks have participated in leveraged buy-outs under waivers allowing them to buy nearly 50% of small businesses.
In the current climate in which several leveraged companies have run into trouble, unsettling the entire junk-bond market, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> apparently drew the line at allowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> unit to qualify as a small business.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>, which had been advising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> on the proposed purchase, will instead lead a group of buyers in the realigned sale, which will account for about 75% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del</ENAMEX> Monte equity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> is expected to take the remaining 25%.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill group</ENAMEX> may include a Japanese company but won't include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>'s own leveraged buy-out fund, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Partners</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> may try to round up other equity participants even after the sale announcement.
If completed, the restructured transaction will be the last major transaction in a plan by RJR to sell $5.5 billion worth of food assets within the first year after its record $25 billion leveraged buy-out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> already announced an $875 million sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX>'s fresh-fruit business to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polly Peck International PLC</ENAMEX>. Earlier last summer, it sold several European food businesses for $2.5 billion. Although the price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> canned-foods unit came in slightly less than expected, one reason was that operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> weren't included.
