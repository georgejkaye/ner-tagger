A unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition Partners</ENAMEX> launched a $10-a-share tender offer for the shares outstanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts Corp.</ENAMEX>, and said it would seek to liquidate the computer-printer maker ``as soon as possible,'' even if a merger isn't consummated.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition</ENAMEX> is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crescott Investment Associates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson Investment Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kernel Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catalyst Partners</ENAMEX>. The investor group owns 1,534,600 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX> common shares, or a 7.6% stake.
The offer is based on several conditions, including obtaining financing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition</ENAMEX> said it had received the reasonable assurance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chase Manhattan Bank N.A.</ENAMEX> that the financing can be obtained.
In a filing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition</ENAMEX> said it expects it will need about $215 million to buy the shares and pay related fees and expenses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition</ENAMEX> added that it has not begun discussions with financing sources, and said it expected to repay the amounts borrowed through proceeds of the liquidation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX> officials declined to comment, and said they had not yet seen a suit filed in federal court by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition</ENAMEX> that seeks to nullify a standstill agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX>.
Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPC Acquisition</ENAMEX> made a $15-a-share offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX> board said it rejected because the $283.7 million offer was not fully financed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataproducts</ENAMEX> has since started a restructuring, and has said it is not for sale.
