<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico Inc.</ENAMEX>'s international soft-drink division, in a major realignment, said it is creating six new geographic business units, each with self-sufficient operations and broad local authority.
The new organization, covering 150 nations in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola International</ENAMEX> operates, will report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher A. Sinclair</ENAMEX>, who was named president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola International.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sinclair</ENAMEX> was formerly president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola USA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> division.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Enrico</ENAMEX>, who had been serving temporarily as president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola International</ENAMEX>, will remain as president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico World-Wide Beverages</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola International</ENAMEX> said the changes are designed to help increase sales overseas by moving operations and executives closer to the point of sale, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
Wall Street reacted favorably to the news. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX> closed at $57.625 a share, up $1.625.
Industry analysts generally praised the move, saying it would allow the international unit to be more responsive to the demands of soft-drink markets in different areas of the world. ``The opportunities abroad are much greater than they are here domestically,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Romm</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> ``I think what you're seeing is the structure being built to get more active in that area.''
Creation of the units follows the decision last year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola USA</ENAMEX> to start four autonomous domestic divisions, each with its own field-based president and integrated staff. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frito-Lay Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX>'s snack-food division, undertook a similar reorganization in June.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola International</ENAMEX>'s hand may have been forced, according to one analyst, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX>'s aggressive pursuit of joint ventures with overseas bottling companies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>, which dominates many foreign soft-drink markets, can be expected to continue those investments, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Thompson</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>, using some of the money it receives from the proposed sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX> owns 49% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures.</ENAMEX>
Headquarters for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola International</ENAMEX>'s new operations will be <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rio de Janeiro; Nicosia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cyprus</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>. Presidents of the new areas, respectively, will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Meils</ENAMEX>, formerly executive vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola International</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Suarez</ENAMEX>, formerly region vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Jones</ENAMEX>, formerly region vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Blossom</ENAMEX>, formerly a senior manager, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi USA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsi-Cola International</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Ham</ENAMEX>, formerly zone vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Mailloux</ENAMEX>, formerly region vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsico</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Purchase</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>
