The former president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holly Farms Corp.</ENAMEX> has sued his ex-employer, alleging that an error committed by Holly's lawyers cost him and other employees more than $35 million.
In a suit filed last month in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chancery Court</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Lee Taylor II</ENAMEX> alleged that an ``inadvertent drafting error'' in an amendment made to Holly's stock bonus plan in January has financially hurt him and more than 600 other plan participants. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> is also suing Holly on behalf of the others.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wachtell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lipton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen & Katz</ENAMEX> drafted the amendment for Holly. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> hasn't sued <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wachtell</ENAMEX>, but legal experts say that the law firm might be liable if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>'s claim is found to have merit by a court. That is so, the legal experts say, because if Holly loses the suit, Holly could seek to recover its losses by suing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wachtell</ENAMEX>.
``When a lawyer acts negligently and causes injury to a third party, most state courts now recognize that the lawyer may be liable to the third party,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen F. Gillers</ENAMEX>, a professor of legal ethics at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York University</ENAMEX>'s law school. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillers</ENAMEX> and others say that attorney liability to third parties is an area of the law that has been changing rapidly in the past 10 years.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> was fired from his job in August, less than two months after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyson Foods Inc.</ENAMEX> acquired Holly for about $1.29 billion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyson</ENAMEX>'s purchase ended eight months of bidding and litigation with Holly.
Holly has filed a suit of its own against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> Chancery Court. That suit alleges that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> breached his fiduciary duties to Holly by making ``false and misleading statements'' about the stock bonus plan after it was amended in January. Holly seeks compensatory damages and attorneys' fees from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wachtell</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment on the suits. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skadden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arps</ENAMEX>, Slate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meagher & Flom</ENAMEX>, which is representing Holly, also wouldn't comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie A. Nicholson Jr.</ENAMEX>, who is representing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>, declined to comment, as well.
In his suit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX>, where Holly is based, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> contends he interpreted the plan properly and that ``based on the drafting error in the plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyson</ENAMEX> is inequitably causing Holly Farms to take advantage of that error to defeat the rights of the participants in the plan.''
The stock bonus plan, adopted in 1986, was intended to reward Holly employees. The plan was amended by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holly's</ENAMEX> board early this year to provide for a change of control of Holly. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>, who was also a Holly director, described the amendment to Holly's board in a memo distributed to directors in January. He said that under the terms of the amendment, the size of the bonus would depend on the performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holly's</ENAMEX> common stock until the date of an acquisition and the performance of the acquiring company's stock afterward.
However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> now concedes, because of the ``drafting error'' that he later discovered, the amendment called for a payment to participants in the plan based only on the value of the acquirer's stock. That wasn't the board's intention, he says now. The value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyson</ENAMEX>'s stock under the terms of the plan was less than a blended value of Holly and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyson</ENAMEX> stock.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> seeks to recover money he believes he and others are owed by Holly. Holly has moved to dismiss Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> action. A hearing on that motion is scheduled for later this month.
