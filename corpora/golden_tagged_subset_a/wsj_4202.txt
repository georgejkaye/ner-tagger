Right-wing media magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hersant</ENAMEX> won a court battle in the politically charged fight for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s third-largest television station, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> civil court decided to freeze the 16.8% stake held in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX> by insurance group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutuelles Agricoles</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> had feared the group was preparing to sell out to his adversaries, who want to oust him as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX> chairman.
Two other leading shareholders in the station, pro-Socialist businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Seydoux</ENAMEX> and Italian businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silvio Berlusconi</ENAMEX>, want to replace Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> with an as-yet unidentified person of their choosing.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX>'s media group, which also controls the newspapers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Le Figaro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">France Soir</ENAMEX>, owns 25% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX>, the maximum allowed by law. An ally holds another 10.8%. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlusconi</ENAMEX> controls 25%, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seydoux</ENAMEX> controls 6.9%. The two sides are battling for control of the remaining shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX> is among the five television stations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> that are accessible to all viewers.
While the two sides officially are simply arguing over the station's mounting financial losses, the battle has a political background. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> won control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX> under a former center-right government, which lost power in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> last year. Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seydoux</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlusconi</ENAMEX> had controlled the station under the previous Socialist government, and with the Socialists back in power, the two men are seeking to regain control.
While the two sides await a ruling from the court, the board seat controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutuelles Agricoles</ENAMEX> is in the hands of a neutral party. A lawyer for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> said the effect of the litigation, including appeals, will be to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX> chairman in place until year end. That would give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> time to try to improve the station's finances and possibly seek a compromise.
The judge has scheduled a hearing in about a month on the substance of the dispute over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutuelles Agricoles</ENAMEX> shares. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> says a sale would violate an agreement that shareholders offer their shares among one another on a prorated basis. The insurance group denies that it is preparing to violate the agreement.
