Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hamilton</ENAMEX>, the chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Economic Committee</ENAMEX>, wants to do a little remodeling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX>. His timing may seem strange, since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> now is generally well regarded. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Lance</ENAMEX>, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>'s budget chief, once said, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
That theory of government, however, has often led to crash programs amid chaos. Maybe now would be a good time to take a look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX>'s proposals are something less than revolutionary. But they could provide an occasion for a thorough examination of an important government institution, now marking its 75th year, that has often been shaped largely by happenstance.
The proposal that may attract the most attention would put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Board</ENAMEX> and thus on the policy-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market Committee</ENAMEX>. This would be nothing new; before passage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1935 Banking Act</ENAMEX>, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary and the comptroller of the currency were ex-officio board members.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> eliminated the ex-officio members as part of the desperate effort to fix a financial system that was, indeed, broke. It's unclear just how much of a role the secretary had ever played at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. In arguing for removing the ex-officio members, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter Glass</ENAMEX> said, ``When I was secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, I had considerable influence with the action of the board, and I have suspected that frequently since the secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> has had too much influence upon the board, and I do not think he ought to be there.''
The argument for having the secretary on the board is that it might diminish intragovernment warfare. ``There's a lot to be said for it,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Poole</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown University</ENAMEX> economist and former presidential economic adviser. ``It would promote clear lines of responsibility.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poole</ENAMEX> also supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX> plan to require the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market Committee</ENAMEX> to announce immediately the decisions of its policy-making sessions, instead of about six weeks later. ``Nearly all economists,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poole</ENAMEX>, ``would favor the freest possible flow of information.'' Under congressional pressure, the committee's decisions have been announced earlier and earlier, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> has often expressed fear of market disruptions. The trouble hasn't occurred, and few non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> economists see any chance that immediate disclosure would be damaging.
Another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX> proposal is to allow each incoming president to pick his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> chairman. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chairmen</ENAMEX>, like presidents, serve four-year terms but the terms in recent decades have not coincided. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry L. Jordan</ENAMEX>, chief economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Interstate Bancorp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, says, ``It would be a better idea to allow a year between the arrival of a new president and the choice of a chairman. That might separate the action a little from the politicking that surrounds the inauguration.''
Yet another <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX> provision would require publication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s budget. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has always been a little nervous about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>'s ability to create funds through its open market operations. The late Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright Patman</ENAMEX> frequently hounded the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> Banks for data, often on minor expenditures. It's hard to see, however, how publishing budgets could do any damage.
But published budgets alone wouldn't satisfy Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX>. He also wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> to audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> procedures much more closely. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>, however, suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> already is a pretty busy outfit. ``An agency already exists,'' he says, ``that could do the audits.''
This agency is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Advisory Council</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> was established by the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> Act in 1913. There was considerable controversy over which was to run the system -- the banks or the government -- and the council was set up to monitor the system. Each district had a member, and the council was empowered to get any information it wanted.
Until the 1930s the council was quite powerful, but it has been allowed to dwindle to a sort of public relations agency, meeting four times a year in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> but doing very little. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> suggests reviving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAC</ENAMEX> to do any necessary auditing.
There are a number of other issues that could profitably be examined in the current non-crisis atmosphere. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Friedman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> economist, argues that appointments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Bank</ENAMEX> presidents, who make government policy as members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market Committee</ENAMEX>, should require Senate confirmation; at present, they are named by the banks' directors with the approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reserve Board</ENAMEX>. There are arguments against such a change; some analysts fear it would unduly politicize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. But it's an issue well worth study.
Other issues: Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen L. Neal</ENAMEX> has submitted a joint resolution that would instruct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to stabilize prices -- and keep them stable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allan H. Meltzer</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie-Mellon University</ENAMEX> economist, proposes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> be required to announce its plans for a coming year. If it failed to achieve its aims, it would explain why. The president could accept the explanation -- or accept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> officials' resignations.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> may be starting something.
