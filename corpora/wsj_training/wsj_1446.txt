Move over, pornographic phone services: A legal service with a ``900'' number has been launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newport Beach</ENAMEX> law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Telelawyer</ENAMEX>, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communication Corp.</ENAMEX>'s toll-tele-phone service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cane & Associates</ENAMEX> touts its $2-a-minute service as the ``cheapest legal hour you'll ever find.''
Though the service is available only in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telelawyer</ENAMEX> founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Cane</ENAMEX> says he plans to franchise it in other states. He says his aim is to reach people who are bedridden, have no access to transportation, can't find a lawyer to take their case or simply can't afford lawyers' consultation fees.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cane</ENAMEX> stresses that he isn't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep. ``We will only deal with clients on the phone,'' he says. ``We have no in-office business.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telelawyer</ENAMEX> is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit. Local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law. There also are ``800'' hotlines which refer people to lawyers, usually personal-injury specialists, for in-office consultation.
When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing 900-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TELELAW</ENAMEX>, a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys. In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue, Cane lawyers review documents and perform research, if necessary, with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers. There is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone. If the matter requires further legal work or litigation, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cane</ENAMEX> says, his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm. But he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cane & Associates</ENAMEX> doesn't receive referral fees.
So far, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cane</ENAMEX>, most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems, tax problems, divorce, and probate questions. The firm is getting about 50 calls a day, and the average call lasts about 15 minutes. Out of the $2 charge, the law firm pockets about $1.55.
JURY CONVICTS congressman in connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech Corp.</ENAMEX> scandal.
A federal court jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> found U.S. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Garcia</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>) and his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Lee Garcia</ENAMEX>, guilty of extorting $76,000 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> in return for official acts by the congressman. The jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $20,000, interest-free loan from a Wedtech officer. The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments, some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX>, which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise, formerly was a minority-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Bronx</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, defense contractor. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J.M. Little</ENAMEX>, one of the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorneys who prosecuted the case, said the Garcia trial ``is the last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> prosecutions.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little</ENAMEX> said more than 20 people have been convicted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wedtech</ENAMEX> cases, including former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Biaggi</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>).
Lawyers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garcias</ENAMEX> said they plan to appeal. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX>, who represents <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s 18th congressional district, which includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bronx</ENAMEX>, said he hasn't decided whether he will resign.
``In the next few weeks, I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX>, 56 years old. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX>, 49, formerly was a member of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX>'s congressional staff.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garcias</ENAMEX> were cleared of four other felony counts, involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities.
U.S. Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard B. Sand</ENAMEX> set the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garcias</ENAMEX>' sentencing for Jan. 5.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIVE SHEA & GOULD PARTNERS</ENAMEX> are leaving to form a new firm.
The new firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti</ENAMEX>, will be based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. The five partners who resigned from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shea & Gould</ENAMEX> late last week are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Hutton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Ingram</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Yuzek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Carroll</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Bertolotti</ENAMEX>. They will be joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gainen</ENAMEX>, who resigned from the firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lepatner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gainen & Block</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Rubenstein</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> publicist who represents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shea & Gould</ENAMEX>, said, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shea & Gould</ENAMEX> understands they're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubenstein</ENAMEX> said the five, who weren't on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shea & Gould</ENAMEX>'s management committee, ``are leaving on good terms.''
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shea & Gould</ENAMEX> held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hutton Ingram</ENAMEX> will have a general corporate, securities, real-estate and litigation practice, and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community.
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS against lawyers open to public in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>.
While investigations into lawyer misconduct will remain secret, the public will be notified once a formal complaint is filed against an attorney. The actual disciplinary hearings will be public.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them. Non-lawyers will be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX>.
One vocal critic of the changes, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Lupel</ENAMEX>, says non-lawyers shouldn't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships. In addition, he says, publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation.
Nevertheless, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lupel</ENAMEX> anticipates no legal action to reverse the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s decision to institute the changes.
``There's no constitutional right involved in the rule change,'' he says. ``You don't have a right to practice. You only have a privilege to practice.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc.</ENAMEX> agreed to pay a $50,000 fine to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX>, the 26th state to settle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> in the wake of the firm's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> doesn't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> office, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon. The firm has said it expects to pay $11.5 million overall to settle with states. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud; it also made a $650 million civil settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>.
