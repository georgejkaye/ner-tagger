whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina Mcnamee</ENAMEX> WCRS agency created liar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Isuzu</ENAMEX>, among others -- announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX>.
The complex restructuring, which was long expected, transforms <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> from primarily a creator of advertising into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s largest buyers of advertising time and space. It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and headed jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> ad man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Della Femina</ENAMEX> and two top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> executives. The merged agency's admittedly ambitious goal: to become one of the world's 10 largest agencies, while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>'s restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, the move gives it a strong U.S. foothold in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX>, and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide. It also gives the outspoken Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> -- who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients -- an international platform that he most certainly won't be loath to use.
According to terms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> will pay 2.02 billion French francs ($318.6 million) for the 50% it doesn't already own of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat Holding S.A.</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s largest media buyers. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX>, which had held 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>'s ad unit, will pay # 43.5 million ($68.5 million) to raise its stake to 60%. That price also covers Eurocom raising to 60% its 51% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belier Group</ENAMEX>, a joint venture ad agency network it owns with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> will also have the right to buy the remaining 40% of the merged ad agency group in six years.
The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd.</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWDB</ENAMEX>. The merged agency will include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina Mcnamee</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX>'s various agencies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belier Group</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WCRS</ENAMEX>'s other advertising and direct marketing operations.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> will be joint chairman with former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Wight</ENAMEX>. Both will report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Breene</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency.
In an interview in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breene</ENAMEX>, fresh from a Concorde flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> where executives had worked through most of the night, outlined big plans for the new agency. ``Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 position... by the end of three years from now. It implies very dramatic growth,'' he said. He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> had agreed to provide a development fund of # 100 million for acquisitions. The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breene</ENAMEX> said it also plans to make acquisitions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and elsewhere.
Cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> had billings of just $660 million last year and ranked as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s 24th-largest ad agency. The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $2.6 billion -- most of that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide. To make it to top-10 status, it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey Advertising</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnicom</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX>.
The merged agency's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may prove equally difficult. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> created <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina Mcnamee</ENAMEX> out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988, it said it did so in order to attract larger clients, especially packaged-goods companies. Since then, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> won <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>'s Saran Wrap.
But major packaged-goods players of the world -- such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate-Palmolive</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> -- have steadfastly eluded the agency. ``Three of our favorite names,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> calls that roster, adding hopefully, ``We're a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday.''
Still, the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> has seen. As part of the restructuring, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
What's more, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and brothers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert Gross</ENAMEX>, who founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX>, will acquire 14.99% stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS Group</ENAMEX>, creating a powerful link between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carat</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> will receive its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> stake as part of payment for the 50% Carat stake that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> is buying, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> said it expects to pay about # 32 million for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> stake.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency, serving as a sort of ``creative conscience.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise Mcnamee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX>'s president, will continue running the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> agency day-to-day. They and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Della Femina</ENAMEX> will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum, which some industry executives pegged at about $10 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS Group</ENAMEX>, for its part, will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming ``a holding company for a series of media-related businesses,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Scott</ENAMEX>, the firm's chief executive. In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> will hold onto its public relations, TV programming and other businesses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> says its debt will be cut to # 24 million from # 66 million as a result of the transaction.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, the alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> is intended to strengthen its own push outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gross</ENAMEX> brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space. By buying the space in bulk, they obtain discounts as high as 50%, which they can pass on to customers. They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fiat S.p. A.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>. But now, other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> wants to expand to the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
To help finance the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carat</ENAMEX> purchase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> said it plans an issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euroconvertible</ENAMEX> preferred shares once the market settles down. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCRS</ENAMEX> added that ``in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets,'' it has arranged medium-term debt financing, which would be underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samuel Montagu & Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ltd.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earthquake</ENAMEX>'s Damage
Tuesday's earthquake brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday, with only a few staffers showing up at their offices, mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new-business presentations.
While no agencies reported injuries to employees, the quake damaged the offices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Walter Thompson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiat/Day/Mojo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX>, among others, spokesmen for those agencies said. Staffers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson</ENAMEX>, whose offices are in the ultramodern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Embarcadero Center</ENAMEX>, watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet, according to a spokeswoman. Plaster fell and windows were broken at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiat/Day/Mojo</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for that agency said.
Late yesterday afternoon, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX> executives were scrambling to figure out what to do about a new business presentation that had been scheduled for today, a spokesman said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDB Needham</ENAMEX>'s office building may have sustained structural damage, the spokesman added. ``All operations have stopped,'' he said. A number of agencies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foote</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cone & Belding</ENAMEX>, said some employees who live outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, fearful that they wouldn't be able to get home, spent the night at the agency.
