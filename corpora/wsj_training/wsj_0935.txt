<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman Kodak Co.</ENAMEX>'s data-processing needs. But the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> to archrival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maynard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> to manage all of its voice and data communications needs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> also had bid for the business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Armonk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>
The loss is a setback to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, which pointed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> contract as an example of its success in systems integration. That's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kodak</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract, which is still in negotiation. He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochester Telephone Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> itself would likely be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s subcontractors on the project.
``When we decided to look outside the company for critical data-processing and communications services, we wanted to get the best vendor for that service,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Allen</ENAMEX>, the spokesman. ``That's why we went with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> for data center management... and now Digital for voice and data telecommunications.
