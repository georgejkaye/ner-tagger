Through the ages, certain names have become inextricably linked with geographical locations: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roald Amundsen</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pole</ENAMEX>, for instance, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Rose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>.
In the New Age, there may be a new pairing: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Buffett</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX>, the 31-year-old son of billionaire investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Buffett</ENAMEX>, is channeling his energy into transforming the Midwestern city known for breweries and bratwurst into a mecca for the New Age.
New Age is a vague term that has come to be associated with a variety of spiritual, astrological and even psychological endeavors. ``It has some pretty funny connotations,'' admits Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX>, a New Age musician and former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> ad man.
But for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX>, who has written music for milk commercials and ads for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Sprint</ENAMEX>, New Age is ``a philosophy of being concerned for something other than yourself.''
So how does one go about turning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> into the New Age capital?
For starters, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> and his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary</ENAMEX>, who is also a musician, are merging their ad agency with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> company that recorded his two albums.
Next, the couple bought a house. They spent nearly $1.2 million last month on a nine-bedroom Italian Renaissance-style mansion in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whitefish Bay</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> suburb.
The house could become a landmark of the New Age. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffetts</ENAMEX> plan to play host to musical performances and benefits for causes such as protecting the environment and combating homelessness. The house wasn't bought ``strictly for my own sense of importance,'' he says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> says he settled on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> not just because the record company was located there: ``The quality of life was the single biggest factor,'' he says.
With all this activity, it's no wonder city officials seem so happy to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffetts</ENAMEX> in town. ``New Age music is wonderful '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kristine Martinsek</ENAMEX>, the city's director of marketing and civic development. And, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buffetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>'s mayor is also a strong advocate of a clean environment, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martinsek</ENAMEX> adds.
Making Milwaukee a New Age model may sound like a lot of work. But, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buffett</ENAMEX> says, it ``seemed like the way to make a mark that's broader than just an advertising business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
