<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar PLC</ENAMEX>, with few defenses to ward off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s unfriendly advance, appears to be pinning its hopes on finding a friendly partner.
The board of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s leading luxury-car maker confirmed late Friday that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s surprise bid for a minority stake was ``unwelcome.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> directors, after their regular monthly meeting, also vowed to ``pursue plans that would preserve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s independence.'' A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> spokesman said, ``That means they have some ideas in their heads, but they aren't prepared to say what it {the defense plan} is.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> caught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> off guard Tuesday by disclosing intentions to buy as much as 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s shares -- the maximum permitted under British government restrictions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s best bulwark looks like a friendly tie-up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, through a substantial minority holding or a joint venture, say several takeover experts and industry analysts. During the weekend, the British news media speculated on an imminent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> alliance, giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> a minority holding that eventually would rise to no more than 30%.
A rival car manufacturer's purchase of a sizable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> stake ``might well do'' the trick for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>, said an individual knowledgeable about the situation. ``If two people are interested in this thing {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>}, it could drive up the price quite dramatically.'' Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s share price is zooming. It soared 33 pence, to 581 pence ($9.18) a share, this year's highest level, in late trading Friday on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, after gaining 143 pence during the previous three days.
A partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> could offer Jaguar another line of defense against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>. ``It might give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> antitrust problems if it tried to acquire a company which had a major joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Gordon</ENAMEX>, a takeover lawyer at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> office of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown & Platt</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX> isn't involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> matter. But there is a hitch. It isn't clear how badly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> wants to strike a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> executives have held fruitless talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> Chairman Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Egan</ENAMEX>. The tough-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> boss probably hopes he can woo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> by offering more attractive terms. But with its car-market share sagging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> doesn't need another problem child. In addition, the giant auto maker generally avoids bidding wars.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alternatively</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> could join forces with one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s European competitors, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen AG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB Volvo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peugeot S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. But all three car makers have denied market rumors about their possible interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>. Analysts reckon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s value in a takeover fight lies between # 6 and # 10 a share -- or between about # 1 billion ($1.58 billion) and # 1.8 billion.
The British government limits will keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> a minority shareholder for more than a year, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> breathing space to construct defensive walls. The restrictions prevent any outside investor from buying more than 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> shares without permission until Dec. 31, 1990.
But unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> lands a rich and protective ``sugar daddy,'' it may have difficulty finding an alternative defense strategy, takeover specialists said. A political campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> as an unwanted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> invader could backfire.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> ``doesn't want to whip up anti-American feeling if it's trying to do a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Jones</ENAMEX>, a professor of motor-industry management at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Cardiff</ENAMEX> business school in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wales</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s active courting of British government officials is costing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> some potentially powerful allies. On Thursday, for instance, Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s stake purchase should strengthen the luxury-car maker. Many auto-industry watchers say Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> may relax the government's antitakeover barrier prematurely if a full bid would assure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s financial security.
Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s union leaders, unhappy with Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>'s anti-union sentiments, are willing to embrace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> because they fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> is too small to survive alone.
On Friday night, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> executives tried to assuage unionists' fears by telling them <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>'s long-term survival plan involves a collaborator. But one union officer said he and other auto-industry union representatives will confer with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> officials tomorrow about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> car maker's plans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>.
In its current financial dilemma, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> also can't easily rally support from institutional shareholders. Two weeks ago, largely blaming setbacks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market, the company reported a 94% plunge in pretax profit for the first half.
Some form of corporate restructuring might fail to fend off Ford as well. ``I doubt {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>} shareholders will be very enamored of a restructuring'' especially when ``they see a possible bid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX>, the lawyer.
A management buy-out also seems unfeasible. ``The sums involved just don't stack up,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Barber</ENAMEX>, a car-industry analyst at British brokers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Capel & Co.</ENAMEX>
