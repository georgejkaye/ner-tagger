<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerica Corp.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penncorp Financial</ENAMEX> insurance unit for $300 million to an investment group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJS/Inverness & Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penncorp Financial</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Fund Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans Pacific Life Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> For the first six months of 1989, the group earned about $10 million, or about 9% of total Primerica first-half profit. The group had been projected to have full-year net income of $20 million to $25 million, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerica</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said. All three insurance firms underwrite and market specialized individual life, accident and health insurance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerica</ENAMEX>, a financial services concern, said sale proceeds would be used to reduce debt or buy back common stock. The spokeswoman said no decision on how the proceeds will be spent will be made until after the company completes the purchase of a minority interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.L. Williams Co.</ENAMEX>, another insurance concern. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams</ENAMEX>'s holders are scheduled to vote on the proposed transaction in late October.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerica</ENAMEX> stock rose 87.5 cents a share to close at $28.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mitchell</ENAMEX>, a partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weiss Peck & Greer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerica</ENAMEX> holder, said the deal ``looks OK,'' but that given the size and complexity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primerica</ENAMEX>, ``it's kind of a non-event.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJS/Inverness</ENAMEX> is a closely held financial services company. It said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William M. Mccormick</ENAMEX>, a former chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, will become chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penncorp Financial.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccormick</ENAMEX> also is a member of the buy-out group, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJS/Inverness</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJS/Inverness</ENAMEX>'s principal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald J. Stone</ENAMEX>, said the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penncorp Financial</ENAMEX> will give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJS/Inverness</ENAMEX> an entree into the insurance arena, ``a business in which we hope to have an expanding presence,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJS/Inverness</ENAMEX> has been involved in leveraged buy-outs both as a principal, as with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penncorp Financial</ENAMEX>, and as an intermediary, as with the recent acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX> unit by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diamandis Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>
