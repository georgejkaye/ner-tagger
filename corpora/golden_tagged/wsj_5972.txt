<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee Corp.</ENAMEX> said it created an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee Stock Ownership Plan</ENAMEX> to be funded by a $125 million loan guaranteed by the company.
At current market prices, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX> would be able to purchase about 2.5 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee</ENAMEX> shares, or 5.2% of the 48.3 million shares now outstanding.
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee</ENAMEX>'s May proxy statement, officers and directors own only 4.4% of the company, so the projected combined ownership of management and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX> still would be less than 10%.
A spokesman for the energy and chemical company said the move wasn't intended as a defensive measure. ``This is intended for employee benefit reasons,'' he said.
The company has long been viewed as a potentially attractive takeover candidate, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders IXL Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an Australian concern, disclosed in July that it owned 4.7% of the company. Just a few days before that disclosure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerr-Mcgee</ENAMEX> strengthened provisions of its anti-takeover measure.
The company said that beginning Jan. 1, the company will match employee contributions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX> instead of matching contributions to the company's current savings investment plan.
