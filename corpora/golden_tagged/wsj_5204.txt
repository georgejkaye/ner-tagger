A battle for control over a technology critical to computer publishing is testing the mettle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, for years a darling of investors because of its high profits and seemingly impregnable market position.
While the battle turns on arcane points about software, it illustrates how in the computer industry small companies are coming under increasing pressure from the industry's giants. It also demonstrates the risk of alienating customers by aggressively pursuing high profits from a near-monopoly.
In an attempt to preserve the pre-eminent role of its Postscript software, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> on Wednesday said it would release technical information that will make it easier for competitors to copy the software, which controls how computer printers produce typefaces and other images.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s move came a day after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s largest customer, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Inc.</ENAMEX>, the biggest maker of personal-computer software, announced they would offer a product that would rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postscript</ENAMEX>. The companies said their software would have different features than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s, but neither would say when it would be available.
Fears over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> agreement sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> shares plunging. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> plummeted $4.125 a share to close at $15.625 -- a drop of 40% from levels at the beginning of the month.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Warnock</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s chief executive officer, said his company's decision to make available the technical data was ``inevitable, it was only a matter of time.'' He conceded that the move was prompted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> announcement.
Some industry observers say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> may be more interested in breaking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s monopoly than in offering better software. ``If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> were a larger company, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John {Warnock</ENAMEX>} would not have caved in, he would have been in court,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Shaffer</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Letter</ENAMEX>. ``Faced with the pressure from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>, it was an easy choice: your money or your life.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaffer</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s involvement also points to a double standard for the computer industry's giants. ``It's ironic... that Apple should team up to deliberately produce an imitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s product,'' he said, ``when Apple itself fears the same kind of attack'' on the system software for its popular Macintosh computer.
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> last year for copying parts of its Macintosh software. The case is pending.
Analysts suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> might have avoided its current straits if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> had moved more rapidly to mollify critics, who have complained about the company's steep royalties and withholding of technical information. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> might have... done this 12 months ago'' and prevented Apple from teaming up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Nelson</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman.</ENAMEX>
Many analysts think Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warnock</ENAMEX> also could have cut royalty rates -- long a sticking point with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> and other Adobe customers. For years, makers of personal computers and top software companies have chafed under royalty charges that bring Adobe as much as $250 for every printer sold that functions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postscript</ENAMEX>.
In the past, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s customers had little choice but to ante up. That's because a string of small competitors have found it difficult to duplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s software -- and customers haven't embraced the few companies who do offer rival products. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postscript</ENAMEX> is ``a complicated program to copy legally,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lecompte</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Printout</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newtonville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, newsletter. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lecompte</ENAMEX> estimates that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> still holds ``well over 90% of the market for Postscript products.''
Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> can retain its dominant position in printer software may depend on how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> responds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> moves. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX>, chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Next Inc.</ENAMEX> and an Adobe proponent, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has the clout to either protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s position or promote a rival standard.
So far, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> hasn't indicated what it will do. The company is an Adobe customer, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick Donofrio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> vice president, advanced workstation division, said at an industry conference here this week that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> approach for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OS</ENAMEX>\ software, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> uses for its latest generation of personal computers.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s concession comes too late for them to alter their plans. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall S. Battat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s vice president for product marketing, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> might have continued to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s software ``if years ago'' the company had lowered royalty rates and provided greater ``flexibility and openness'' about its software.
Founded in 1982, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> is credited with supplying the software instrumental to turning the desktop computer into a personal print shop. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> agreement isn't expected to have any short-term impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX>'s revenue, which is expected to top $115 million for the fiscal year ending Nov. 30.
