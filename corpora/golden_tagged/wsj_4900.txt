<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Inc.</ENAMEX>'s ``Where's the beef?'' ads made a mint for the hamburger chain and turned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clara Peller</ENAMEX> into a stentorian, crotchety cult hero. But since the 1984 campaign, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s has spun its wheels with an ill-fated omelette, slipshod stores and forgettable ads.
Now the company has turned to another improbable television personality: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. David Thomas</ENAMEX>, who founded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s 20 years ago. The round-faced, bespectacled Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> hopes his folksy on-air demeanor will improve the company's image.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Iacocca</ENAMEX>, he's not. ``I'm a hamburger cook, not a celebrity,'' says the 57-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>. ``I'm only trying to sell hamburgers, and if I don't, I'm history.''
Selling hamburgers is tough these days for fast-food restaurants. The $60-billion-a-year industry expects little growth this year, and heavy discounting to boost market share is cutting profits. Small drive-through hamburger stands have saturated some markets, while beef consumption in general is falling.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s desperately needs to increase customer traffic for its 1,159 company-operated restaurants and 2,609 franchisees. In the first half of this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s operating profit fell 29% to $10.1 million, largely because of higher costs related to couponing, local advertising and chicken prices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dublin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, has seen its market share fall to 4.8% last year from 5.5% in 1984. Competition with the three leading hamburger chains -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX>'s Burger King and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imasco Ltd.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hardee</ENAMEX>'s -- is expected to intensify.
Burger King in May switched advertising agencies, dropping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N W Ayer</ENAMEX> and splitting its $215 million account equally between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising</ENAMEX>. The first ads are expected to appear this fall. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met</ENAMEX>, which acquired Burger King last year, is expected to heavily promote the chain.
That will put added pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy's</ENAMEX>, which has sunk most of its $50 million television advertising budget for 1989 into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Thomas</ENAMEX> commercials, produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX>. Trade publications, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advertising Age</ENAMEX>, have panned the ads, saying that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> is stiff and awkward, but polls conducted in July by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gallup Organization</ENAMEX> show that the ads have increased consumer awareness. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s hasn't released sales figures since the campaign went into full swing in June.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s still appears to be searching for the right TV ad formula. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James W. Near</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive officer, says the ads with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> are a ``bridge until we find out what we want to do with our marketing.'' The company also plans to run ads featuring Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>'s daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>, for whom the chain was named. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>, now 28 years old, and her husband operate a golf course in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>)
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Near</ENAMEX> acknowledges that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s has had trouble forging a consistent, strong identity. Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's</ENAMEX>, whose ads always include the same type of happy jingles, family images and golden arches, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s hasn't been able latch on to lasting slogans or motifs. Further, its expanded menu of salads, chicken sandwiches and small buffets with Mexican food and pasta may have detracted from what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s says is its strong suit -- high-quality hamburgers. An omelette introduced in 1985 flopped -- partly because customers couldn't eat it in the car -- and was discontinued by most stores.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s problems have also stemmed from neglecting store operations during the years of runaway growth. During much of the 1980s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s added hundreds of stores each year, and customers came by droves after the ``Where's the beef'' campaign. They found the beef, but they also found poor service, messy tables and inconsistent quality.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s ``didn't watch the stores as carefully as they should have been, and some credibility was lost between the franchisee and the company,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Near</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s franchise owner.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Near</ENAMEX>'s effort to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s around began when he joined the company as chief operating officer in 1986. He cut 500 positions, or about one-third of the staff. Last year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s sold or closed 26 more stores than it opened. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Near</ENAMEX>, 51, has also introduced a smaller, less expensive hamburger and several 99-cent items, such as junior bacon cheeseburgers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s also is seeking to ensure that bathrooms are mopped and employees smile. This month it is offering cash incentives to the operators of the best-looking restaurants, and the manager of the cleanest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX>'s gets a Corvette.
