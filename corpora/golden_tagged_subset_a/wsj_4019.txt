<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin Corp.</ENAMEX> said the top officers of its two biggest shareholders were elected the company's chairman and chief executive officer, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David G. Sadler</ENAMEX> resigned those posts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles A. Muench</ENAMEX>, the 52-year-old president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorocs Corp.</ENAMEX>, which holds 30% voting control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> securities, was elected chairman. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.P. van den Boogaard</ENAMEX>, 40, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCS Technology N.V.</ENAMEX>, which holds 25%, was elected chief executive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCS</ENAMEX>, which holds 25% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> and has indicated that it might buy as much as 55%, holds about 30% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorocs</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norcross</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>, maker of color copiers.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadler</ENAMEX>, 50, is credited with a major restructuring that decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX>'s debt to $45 million from $223 million and increased equity to $66 million from a negative $94 million, the company said.
The change in management reflects ``the emergence of Savin from a period of financial uncertainty to one of growth and expansion,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadler</ENAMEX>, who headed the distributor of copiers and facsimile machines since December 1986, said he will ``walk out with $3 million in cash'' as severance pay and plans to take a sabbatical. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadler</ENAMEX> said he has been in talks with investment bankers about consulting or working as an interim chief executive.
After five years of losses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> was profitable in 1987 and 1988, but sales have been weaker this year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sadler</ENAMEX> said. He added, ``I think (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> will) have a fairly strong fourth quarter.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> closed at 37.5 cents, unchanged, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> Friday.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van den Boogaard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.J.G.M. Sanders</ENAMEX>, the 33-year-old chief financial officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCS</ENAMEX>, were elected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX>'s 12-member board. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David M. Deans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Leland Strange</ENAMEX>, who represent Colorocs, resigned from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> board.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCS</ENAMEX> has interests in software and hardware development, automation projects and visual communications. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCS</ENAMEX> recently launched a joint effort to sell color copiers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
No other management changes are expected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savin</ENAMEX> said.
