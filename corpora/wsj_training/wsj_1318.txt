<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX> said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and, eventually, to U.S. theaters, too.
The operator of cable-television networks said the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX> unit will produce movies that will premiere on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Network Television</ENAMEX> channel, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX>, and then will be released internationally in movie theaters.
The unit's first two offerings are slated to be ``The Secret Life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Fleming</ENAMEX>,'' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Bond</ENAMEX> novels, and ``Treasure Island,'' produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlton Heston</ENAMEX>, who also stars in the movie.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX>'s chairman, was named chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry Hogan</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Entertainment Networks</ENAMEX>, was named president of the unit.
In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogan</ENAMEX> said the subsidiary's primary mission will be to make movies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNT</ENAMEX> and to distribute them internationally. But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting</ENAMEX> already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
``When that occurs, and when the time is right, we'll release the films in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,'' he said, adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Pictures</ENAMEX> may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner</ENAMEX> has made several movies, docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years, but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hogan</ENAMEX> said ``The Secret Life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ian Fleming</ENAMEX>'' and ``Treasure Island'' cost more than $6 million each to make, which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release.
The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Inc.</ENAMEX> formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Pictures</ENAMEX> to produce 12 low-budget movies a year that will premiere on Showtime network and be distributed later in various markets, including foreign theaters.
