<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> is in negotiations with the Turkish government to build between 50 and 100 Chinook helicopters in that country, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puget Sound</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Journal</ENAMEX> reported.
The newest version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chinook</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CH</ENAMEX>-47D, costs about $15 million each, giving the total deal a potential value of $750 million or more. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> has purchased 472 of the twin-rotor helicopters, or about half the world fleet, during the past two decades. But as the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinook</ENAMEX> has risen, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> has been refurbishing its existing helicopters rather than purchasing new ones, and the aerospace firm has had to look elsewhere for buyers.
The talks were disclosed by Turkish Ambassador Nuzhet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kandemir</ENAMEX>, who was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> earlier this month for a trade conference. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burl Zorn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Helicopters</ENAMEX>' area-sales director for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, also confirmed that the Turkish government had inquired about building the helicopters under some form of co-production agreement, the newspaper said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> already has an agreement under which F-16 fighter planes are being built in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>.
A version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinook</ENAMEX> is being built in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> under a co-production agreement, but it is limited to the Japanese market. However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kandemir</ENAMEX> said he hopes any agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> would allow <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX> to eventually export Chinooks built there, the newspaper said.
