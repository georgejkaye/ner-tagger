Launching a battle in a bitter war, federal regulators filed a civil lawsuit seeking more than $1.1 billion from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles H. Keating Jr.</ENAMEX>, various members of his family and officers and directors of the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX>.
The suit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, headquarters city, alleges Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> and his family profited through insider dealing, illegal loans, sham real-estate and tax transactions, and the fraudulent sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> stock to employees of the parent company. The suit also named a number of subsidiaries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX>, which itself was taken under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy-law protection the day before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> was seized by regulators last April.
Moreover, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> and six of the other defendants Friday were charged with racketeering. Of the damages sought, $250 million stem from charges brought under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racketeer Influenced</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrupt Organizations</ENAMEX> law and could be trebled by the court.
Although the suit alleges that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> sustained total damages in excess of $1.1 billion, total damages could exceed $2.5 billion, according to an attorney familiar with the complaint.
In addition to naming Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX>, the 160-page suit alleges wrongdoing by his wife, several of their children and their childrens' spouses, many of whom work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX> or its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> unit, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irvine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
The action also names <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Keating</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating</ENAMEX>'s brother and a former judge and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> congressman from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> who more recently was publisher of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati Enquirer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Keating</ENAMEX>, who was an American Continental director for roughly one year, said he received a copy of the suit only yesterday and declined to comment until after reviewing it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating</ENAMEX>, the 66-year-old real-estate developer and heavy political contributor to candidates of both political parties, has vociferously complained that the government has waged a personal vendetta against him for repudiating its thrift-industry policies. He was said to be traveling and unavailable to comment over the weekend. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Melvin Mcdonald</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> who represents <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX> and its principals, said the allegations in the suit are ``trying to take things that are completely harmless and trying to make something sinister out of them.'' He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX> was ``absolutely confident'' that a jury would find in its favor.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonald</ENAMEX> said he was struck by ``the mean-spirited nature of the lawsuit, which isn't surprising. It identifies personal members of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX>'s family -- wives, husbands -- virtually seeking not only to destroy Keating but to destroy members of his family as well.'' He also charged regulators with leaking to reporters substantial portions of the suit as it was being prepared, saying that ``we've now been defending this lawsuit for six weeks'' in the press. Charging racketeering, he said, is an attempt ``to get sex appeal in their case. These {defendants} aren't racketeers, these are people that are builders, that have been patriots of this country.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating</ENAMEX> has said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX>'s acquisition of Lincoln more than six years ago was designed to allow it to benefit from liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> thrift rules that permitted high levels of direct investment in real estate, junk bonds and other activities potentially more lucrative for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX> than the traditional thrift-industry home-mortgage vehicle.
But the suit by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> -- the first it has filed since being signed into law by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in August to oversee sales or mergers of the nation's insolvent thrifts -- charges that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> as a way of using its government-insured deposits as a personal cache for real-estate deals. It says they engaged in circular transactions that benefited the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> family and parent-company officials at the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> and the savings-and-loan deposit insurance fund.
For example, the suit contends that family members sold personal American Continental stockholdings to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX>'s employee stock ownership plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> put up $15 million of its property as collateral for a loan that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESOP</ENAMEX> needed to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keating</ENAMEX> stock. The transaction resulted in a loss to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> of $11 million, the suit says.
The suit also alleges that American Continental fraudulently siphoned funds from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>, supposedly to pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX>'s share of tax liabilities on certain loans. Regulators say that the loans actually were sham transactions, and that American Continental used the funds for other purposes besides paying taxes. The suit alleges that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> sustained losses in excess of $125 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> also had losses of $76 million, the suit claims, in a series of loans involving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rancho Vistoso</ENAMEX>, a real-estate project near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tucson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz</ENAMEX>. The suit says that the loans were granted without appraisals of the real estate, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX> then drained profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> through a complex series of transactions. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> sold an equity interest in the project to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX>, a purchase the parent financed with proceeds of ``illusory transactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> subsidiaries,'' according to the suit.
Some specific allegations could provide a window on possible criminal charges that could be the next step in the legal entanglements between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX> and the federal government. An industry attorney familiar with the case said a grand jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> has been investigating the company for possible criminal charges, although prosecutors there decline to comment.
One case cited in the litigation Friday involved a sale of stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorex International</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> played a part. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX> was a major customer of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> junk-bond king <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX>.
The suit said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> tried to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorex</ENAMEX> stock to its parent for $2.8 million, based on a fairness opinion it had obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX> regulators rejected the sale. So, according to the suit, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> subsidiary sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorex</ENAMEX> stock to a third party for $1 million, and then American Continental bought the stock for $2 million from the third party, and later resold it for $13.3 million.
For his part, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Keating</ENAMEX> has filed suit in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust</ENAMEX>'s removal as conservator of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> subsequently put <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> in receivership. His suit terms the April seizure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>'s property unconstitutional. The company also has filed a $150 million suit against the regulators, accusing them of ``a pattern of harassment and misrepresentation.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> explained its legal action Friday by noting that ``under the assignment given to us by the president and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to deal with the thrift industry crisis, we have a clear responsibility to take legal action where appropriate to reduce any losses to American taxpayers growing out of fraudulent financial activity.''
Many industry consultants believe that the thrift could cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion by the time it is sold, merged or liquidated.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keating</ENAMEX>, however, lately has been saying that there isn't much that could be recovered from him personally. The executive, who has been most active recently running the Phoenician luxury resort in the Arizona capital, contends that he has been selling off assets and that almost all his family's wealth is in the moribund stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Continental</ENAMEX>.
