Some 433 chief executives on three continents earlier this year completed detailed questionnaires on globalization, as designed by The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Booz-Allen & Hamilton Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nihon Keizai Shimbun</ENAMEX>.
The respondents consisted of 193 executives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, 100 from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, 100 from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and 40 from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> Rim nations such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>. That makes the survey ``one of the largest world-wide pollings of chief executives ever undertaken,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul F. Anderson</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Booz-Allen.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Booz-Allen</ENAMEX> analysts observe dthat the final survey group may be titled slightly toward globally active companies. That's because some executives whose companies have no international operations declined to complete the questionnaires.
Nonetheless, the sample covers a broad range of 20 major industries. To provide the best picture of major national trends, the survey concentrates on executives osf large companies. Of the 433 respondents, 247 of them run companies with annual revenue of $1 billion or more. The survey also includes many executives of smaller U.S. companies.
