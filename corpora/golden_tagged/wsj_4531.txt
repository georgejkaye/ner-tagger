Treasury bond prices drifted yesterday in quiet trading, closely following in the footsteps of the U.S. dollar.
Pummeled by coordinated intervention by central banks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, the dollar fell against all major currencies except the British pound. In late trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, the dollar was quoted at 1.8794 deutsche marks and 140.15 yen, down from 1.8938 marks and 142.4 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was trading at $1.6173, below late Tuesday's 1.618.
The weaker dollar pressured the credit markets, pushing the benchmark 30-year bond 1/8 point lower, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield rose slightly to 8.24% from 8.23%.
``The big cloud over the market was the dollar,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chandross</ENAMEX>, chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank PLC</ENAMEX>. ``Investors are asking whether the major part of the central bank intervention is over or will there be more aggressive efforts to drive the dollar lower.''
Yesterday was the third consecutive day that central banks sold dollars on foreign exchange markets in a relentless attempt to cut the U.S. currency's value.
The bond market often tracks the dollar's movements. That's because a weak dollar is considered inflationary, which, of course, is bad for bonds. Also, a weaker dollar reduces the appeal of U.S. fixed-income securities to foreign investors.
The bond market wasn't affected by yesterday's auction of $7.79 billion of new four-year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> notes. The 8.35% average yield on the new notes was the highest at a government auction of similar notes since 9.70% in March. It was up from the average yield of 8.19% at the previous four-year note auction on June 28.
Demand from individual investors was light at yesterday's auction when compared to previous four-year note auctions. The total $474 million of ``noncompetitive bids,'' which came mainly from individuals, was down sharply from $620 million at the previous sales in June. And it was much smaller than the $1.4 billion of noncompetitive bids at the four-year note auction in March.
``The auction was not an issue. It just happened,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael T. Moran</ENAMEX>, manager of government trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> described yesterday's bond market activity as ``very quiet'' and said the market is likely to remain that way until next Friday, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> releases its potentially market-moving employment report.
``Retail investors won't move off the sidelines until they get a look at some {economic} numbers,'' he said.
Elsewhere, corporate bonds were flat while mortgage-backed securities ended slightly lower.
Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/4 higher, aided by strong demand for new tax-exempt issues. State and local governments issued close to $1 billion of new securities yesterday, including a huge $860 million offering by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Board of Education</ENAMEX>. That comes on top of more than $1.4 billion of municipal bonds issued Tuesday.
``Demand was extremely broad-based'' for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> bonds, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Poll</ENAMEX>, manager of the municipal bond department for lead underwriter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX> He said bond funds, individuals, property and casualty insurers participated, as well as crossover buyers drawn by the attractive yield of the municipals relative to taxable instruments. The largest portion of the offering, $588.6 million of bonds due 2023, was priced to yield 7.55%.
Meanwhile, rumors persisted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> will soon announce details about its first bond offering. The prospect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refcorp</ENAMEX> will soon provide additional supply to an already glutted market also hurt bonds yesterday, according to traders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Refcorp</ENAMEX> is a new government agency created to help rescue the nation's ailing savings and loan associations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency Securities</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities ended modestly lower in light trading. The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 98 18/32 compared with Tuesday's closing price of about 98 21/32. The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 97 30/32 to yield 8.289% compared with 98 2/32 to yield 8.270% Tuesday. The two-year notes that were auctioned Tuesday were quoted in when-issued trading activity at a price to yield about 8.38%.
Short-term rates barely budged yesterday, with the discount rate on three-month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills moving slightly higher to 7.83% for a bond equivalent yield of 8.078% compared with Tuesday's rate of 7.77% and yield of 8.015%. The discount rate on six-month bills rose to 7.84% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.256% compared with a rate of 7.82% and yield of 8.234% Tuesday.
In the agency market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> priced $2.868 billion of short and intermediate-term bonds. The four-part offering included $1.002 billion of three-month bonds priced to yield 8.60%; $1.066 billion of six-month bonds priced to yield 8.65%; $500 million of one-year bonds priced to yield 8.60%; and $300 million of 10-year bonds priced to yield 8.65%.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennessee Valley Authority</ENAMEX> said its board will vote in early October on a plan to tap the federal agency debt market.
The board was expected to vote on the issue yesterday, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX> official said the board will now make a decision nearer to the time of the proposed offering.
If the board approves the plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVA</ENAMEX> expects to refinance $6.5 billion of high-interest debt beginning in the second week of October.
Here are details of yesterday's four-year note auction:
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
Municipals
Investors gave a warm reception to an $860 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Board of Education</ENAMEX> bond offering that dominated the municipal primary market yesterday.
As tentatively priced, the huge offering included a $588.56 million tranche of bonds due in 2023, priced as 7 1/4% bonds to yield 7.55%, directly in line with market expectations. Lead underwriter was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX>
Aided by continued institutional support for new issues and a rebound in Treasury coupon prices, active municipal dollar bonds were unchanged to 1/4 point higher in late dealings.
In the secondary market, some tax-exempts started the day with a downward bias amid signs of dollar weakness and softening Treasurys. But the downtrend reversed by late morning as the government market rebounded, traders said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> Turnpike 7 1/8% issue of 2018 was flat at 96 1/2 to 96 5/8, yielding 7.49%. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Triborough Bridge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tunnel Authority</ENAMEX> 7 1/8% issue of 2019 was up 1/8 at 95 3/8 to 95 5/8.
Foreign Bonds
West German government bonds came under pressure again as market participants become increasingly convinced that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> will boost interest rates at its Oct. 5 meeting.
Investors seemed to ignore comments made Tuesday by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Tietmeyer</ENAMEX>, a finance ministry official who will join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX>'s directorate in January, that the central bank won't be inclined to push up key rates before the next round of negotiations between labor unions and employers.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> trader at a large West German bank noted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tietmeyer</ENAMEX> isn't a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> member yet and that decisions about rates are made by majority vote.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s 6 3/4% issue due 1999 ended 0.20 point lower at 98.20 to yield 7.005%, while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 fell by the same amount to 98.15 to yield 7.23%. The yield curve has become more inverted as yields on 10-year notes have risen nearly.12 percentage point this week, while five-year yields were up.16 percentage point.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, government bonds ended sharply lower for the second consecutive day, reacting further to August's larger-than-expected U.K. trade deficit and to the pound's easing against the West German mark. Long-term British bonds fell more than a point Tuesday after the government said the current-account deficit was nearly # 2 billion {$3.24 billion} in August compared with a projection of # 1.5 billion.
In trading Wednesday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 21/32 point to 111 21/32 to yield 10.12%, while the 11 3/4% issue due 1991 declined 6/32 point to 98 21/32 to yield 12.84%.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, Japanese government bonds firmed. Although now less pronounced, the feeling hasn't diminished that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> will have to raise money-market rates to keep the dollar down.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended at 96.42, up 0.06 point. The yield rose slightly to 5.195%.
Meanwhile, the Japanese government announced that the coupon on its new 10-year notes will be 4.9% and that 500 billion yen {$3.5 billion} of bonds will be offered. A portion of the offering will be put on the block today as 40%, or 200 billion yen, will be sold through competitive bidding. The balance will be placed by an underwriting syndicate.
Traders said investors have shown little interest in the bond auction due to the relatively low coupon rate.
Mortgage-Backed Securities
Mortgage securities ended 1/32 to 3/32 lower after moderate dealings.
Traders said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> 9 1/2% securities were aided by purchases by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> for a new real estate mortgage investment conduit issue.
Late in the session, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> issued a $500 million Remic backed by the 9 1/2% securities through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache.</ENAMEX> The Remic was the only derivative securities offering of the day.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> 9 1/2% securities were off 1/32 at 98 4/32 while other major issues were down 2/32 to 3/32.
Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> 9% securities for October delivery ended at 96 22/32, down 2/32.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> 9% securities yielded 9.61% to a 12-year average life, as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> 10-year note held at 1.32 percentage points. The 10-year note was off about 4/32 at 98.
Corporate Issues
A $100 million note offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bibb Co.</ENAMEX> gave the junk bond market its third new issue this week.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>-based textile concern tapped the market late yesterday afternoon, offering 10-year senior subordinated notes priced to yield 14%.
On Tuesday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> priced $375 million of debentures, and on Monday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formica Corp.</ENAMEX> issued $100 million of junk bonds.
