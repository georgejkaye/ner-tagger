Skittish investors have forced media magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> to scotch plans for an ambitious new investment vehicle. But a source close to the situation said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and its investment bank adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> hope to relaunch the proposal in an altered form.
The failure of the proposed venture, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Partners International Ltd.</ENAMEX> -- dubbed Son of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> -- potentially complicates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s long-term international expansion plans. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> needs another vehicle to take the borrowing pressure off his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>, whose debts have ballooned in the wake of a five-year acquisition streak.
``It is a setback,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Viktor Shvets</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX> stockbrokers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capel Court Powell Ltd.</ENAMEX> But, he added, ``I'm sure it's a temporary one.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shvets</ENAMEX> and others think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> is likely to redesign the venture to make it more advantageous to investors other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>
Under the original plan announced in March, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX> intended to raise at least $1 billion in a world-wide private placement by June 30, 1989, the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s fiscal year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> was to own 20% of the new company and manage it and be entitled to certain fees. As part of the plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> would have then transferred its book-publishing assets to the new company, a transaction that would have lowered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s hefty debt.
But analysts say that, among other things, potential investors were concerned about the fees payable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> disclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s intention to abandon the proposal in an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times.</ENAMEX> ``It was a clever idea,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> was quoted as saying. ``But it was too much of a blank check.''
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> officials weren't immediately available for comment.
Signs that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Partners</ENAMEX> idea was in trouble emerged in early June when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX> conceded it had been able to get commitments for only $450 million from investors other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>, which planned to invest at least $200 million.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX> official said then that trying to put together such a transaction within four months was too optimistic. He attributed the tepid response, particularly among Australian investors, to a misunderstanding of the transaction. The investment bank was confident it would reach its $1 billion target by the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, but the commitments stalled at about $500 million.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> began to implement a stopgap measure, which a senior company official said in June was an ``insurance policy'' against the ``remote chance'' that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Partners</ENAMEX> plan could fall through. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> sold its book-publishing interests, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harper & Row Publishers Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">William Collins PLC</ENAMEX>, for about $1.3 billion to a joint-venture company owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and a company associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> also asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> to arrange an $880 million loan repayable over 7 1/2 years and a $120 million four-year loan to be used as working capital for the joint venture.
That transaction helped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> meet bank creditors' demands that it lower its debt-to-equity ratio. But it also reduced the pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> to quickly complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media Partners</ENAMEX> arrangement. Now, any new transaction is probably months away.
