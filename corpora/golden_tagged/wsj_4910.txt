Six months ago on the eve of her 10th anniversary in office British Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> seemed invincible. Today she looks politically vulnerable. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> could -- and should -- help.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s political isolation has come about in part because of her dispute with European unificationists over the extent to which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> must relinquish its sovereignty in order to participate in the Single European Market, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX>. British Conservative Party losses in the June election for the European Parliament and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s decline in subsequent opinion polls both attest to the damage done to her position by the European issue.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s problems derive from her opponents' success at obscuring the distinction between free trade and national sovereignty. Unificationists such as former Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Heath</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Delors</ENAMEX> have so far convinced the British public that it can't trade more openly with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> without also accepting the dictation of internal British policy from the European bureaucracy, Parliament and courts. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s political future and the future of an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> may depend on her ability to divorce the issue of free trade, which she favors, from the issue of diminished sovereignty, which she does not. With Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delors</ENAMEX> pressing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> to assume ``80% of economic legislation, and perhaps even fiscal and social legislation'' within a decade, and with a British general election expected just before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> goes into effect in 1992, she has no time to waste.
Given both Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s steadfast support for North American interests and the unilateralist tendencies of the British opposition, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and Canadian Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX> might do well to help her make her point. They could do so by inviting the U.K. to enter the recently ratified free-trade agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottawa</ENAMEX>. Such a proposal would have several benefits.
First, the inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> in the North American agreement would enhance the economic position of all three countries. The advantages of free trade that have made the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> so attractive to Europeans -- access to new products, markets and raw materials, enhanced competitiveness and lower consumer prices -- also would commend the idea of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Atlantic Free Trade Area</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX>).
An additional 60 million people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> pact would create a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Atlantic</ENAMEX> market roughly equal to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> in population and gross national product. With North American industries increasingly worried about being locked out of a ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fortress Europe</ENAMEX>'' after 1992, a formal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> trade agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> would ensure that North American companies would maintain a vital link not only with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> but also -- via <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> -- with the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The possibilities for greater access to European markets made available by the new pact would help sell the idea to a U.S. Congress worried about U.S. trade deficits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadians</ENAMEX> might particularly welcome the inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> as a means of diluting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> presence and assuaging voter fears of U.S. ``economic annexation.'' For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, freer access to a market of 250 million prosperous and English-speaking people could give a needed boost to its manufacturing and marketing interests.
Second, the offer would give Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> leverage in her battle to resist the loss of British autonomy to a politically unified <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. An offer to include <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> in the North American agreement would dramatize the difference between a beneficial trading relationship based on the mutual respect of national sovereignty and a semi-statist drive for political amalgamation that threatens the power of local and national legislatures. Recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> attempts to extend its authority over everything from cigarette labels and management practices to minimum-wage laws and tax rates compare unfavorably with the less heavy-handed North American agreement -- the administration of which requires no separate parliament or judiciary and no pan-national bureaucracy. In short, it implies no renunciation of sovereignty.
An invitation to join in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NAFTA</ENAMEX> would enable Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> to test European intentions prior to 1992. In the worst case, if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> entered into a separate agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, moves might be made within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> to deny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> membership in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEM</ENAMEX>. If, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEM</ENAMEX> is primarily concerned with promoting free trade, as most unificationists claim, then there should be no reason to expel member states that enter into separate trade pacts with other nations. Thus, giving Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX> another offer will enable her to demand that the Eurocracy either cease promulgating regulations that violate British sovereignty or risk losing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s participation.
Finally, the agreement would strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Atlantic</ENAMEX> ties at a time when the allure of European pan-nationalism not only threatens European leaders who oppose it, but also promises to alienate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American</ENAMEX> allies. The recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Court of Human Rights</ENAMEX> decision to overrule British compliance with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> extradition request (in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soering</ENAMEX> case) suggests <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s European marriage may begin to limit vital aspects of its ``special relationship'' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.
Since World War II, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American</ENAMEX> military and intelligence cooperation has extended, in the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX> historian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Andrew</ENAMEX>, ``far beyond the formal obligations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic alliance.</ENAMEX>'' During the 1980s, the mutual support provided by this alliance proved essential to the success of unilateral British and U.S. military actions against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX>, both of which were opposed by European allies. Both the removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet SS</ENAMEX>-20s from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> occurred as a result of Anglo-American initiatives that were either resisted or ignored on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Continent</ENAMEX>. The diminution of British autonomy inherent in the idea of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European amalgamation</ENAMEX> raises serious questions about the future of this unique strategic arrangement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bismarck</ENAMEX> observed that the most important fact of the modern world was that the British and the Americans spoke the same language. His remark has proved prophetic. Anglo-North American cooperation has played a decisive role in the outcome of both of this century's world wars, in the maintenance of peace in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for the past 40 years and in the reversal of Soviet expansionism during this decade.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American</ENAMEX> alliance, natural and beneficial though it may be, can not be taken for granted. A minimal precondition of decisive bilateral or trilateral policy is sovereignty of participating nations. The current drift toward the multilateral unification of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> threatens British sovereignty and will encourage British indecision and inaction. Yet current economic and political realities make the gradual surrender of British sovereignty seem inevitable. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>'s attempts to resist this trend have left her isolated. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> wish to maintain their historic relationship with a sovereign British nation, then they must act now and make her a better offer.
