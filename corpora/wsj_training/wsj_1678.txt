<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond-trading executive.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> arbitration panel ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> to pay $404,294 in back bonuses to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Kelly</ENAMEX>, the company's former head of high-yield, high-risk junk-bond trading and sales. It also awarded $196,785 in back bonuses to former trader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Newcomb</ENAMEX> and $69,105 in fees to the two men's attorneys.
The sums awarded to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newcomb</ENAMEX> represent bonuses the two men said they deserved from the first half of 1988, but which weren't paid because of a dispute over an incentive contract.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey L. Liddle</ENAMEX>, the two men's attorney at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liddle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finkelstein & Robinson</ENAMEX>, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> began working at Dean Witter in 1987. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> built the company's high-yield bond group, which has been a minor player in the junk-bond arena.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year; in August it paid $666,666 in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate-bond trading chief, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Bachman</ENAMEX>. That award ended a dispute between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bachman</ENAMEX> over who was responsible for certain bond-trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock-market crash.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX>, declined to comment.
