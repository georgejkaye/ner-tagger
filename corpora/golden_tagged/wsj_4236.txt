As part of its intensifying thrust to revive tobacco sales with a new generation of products, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX> said it is rolling out a low-smoke cigarette called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superslims</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> Slims brand name.
The nation's largest tobacco maker said its new ultra-low-tar cigarette will emit 70% less smoke from the lit end than conventional cigarettes through a special combination of porous and nonporous paper. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superslims</ENAMEX> are skinny: only 17 millimeters in circumference, compared with 25 millimeters for standard cigarettes.
Some analysts played down the significance of the introduction, saying the niche product isn't a technological breakthrough and is unlikely to reverse the decline of the tobacco industry. They speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> is simply trying to blunt the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Capri</ENAMEX>, the ultra-thin cigarette made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown & Williamson Co.</ENAMEX> subsidiary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capri</ENAMEX> holds 0.6% of the market. Ads planned for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superslim</ENAMEX> will state that it produces 60% less smoke than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capri</ENAMEX>.
``It's possible that a cigarette with less smoke will permit women to smoke more, but it still isn't going to be a big product,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Burry</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> analyst. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burry</ENAMEX> added that the cigarette probably won't deliver enough taste -- and enough nicotine -- to suit most smokers. ``When you cut smoke, you cut the tar and nicotine,'' he said. Superslims contain 6.0 milligrams of tar and 0.5 milligram of nicotine. By comparison, full-strength Marlboros contain 16 milligrams of tar and 1.1 milligrams of nicotine.
The introduction of the low-smoke cigarette comes just a few months after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> began testing Next, billed as the first virtually nicotine-free cigarette. The product, which looks and burns like a regular cigarette, is a sharp contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>'s ill-fated ``smokeless'' cigarette called Premier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Premier</ENAMEX>, essentially a gizmo designed to deliver nicotine, didn't burn tobacco. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX> is currently testing its own low-smoke cigarette called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vantage Excell</ENAMEX> 100's.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company is so confident about the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superslims</ENAMEX> that it is rolling the product out nationally without the usual test-market phase. (Analysts note that the rush to market is also neatly timed to coincide with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> Slims tennis tournament next month).
The ad campaign for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superslims</ENAMEX>, developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leo Burnett</ENAMEX> U.S.A. agency, will begin late next month with the slogans, ``Introducing the first low-smoke cigarette for women'' and ``Fat smoke is history.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Slims</ENAMEX>, the leading cigarette among women, has about a 3% share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> tobacco market.
