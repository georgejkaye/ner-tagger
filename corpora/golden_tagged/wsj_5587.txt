Banking regulators continued their tug-of-war over industry capital standards, as some members of a House banking subcommittee urged a tough standard.
At a hearing yesterday, Comptroller of the Currency <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Clarke</ENAMEX> defended his proposal that capital be at least 3% of assets, compared with the current 6% minimum. He characterized a 3% minimum as the ``floor'' beneath the industry's new standard, in which capital requirements are based on the riskiness of a bank's loans.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Seidman</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX>, pushed for a 6% minimum, to better protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDIC</ENAMEX> from bank losses. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDIC</ENAMEX>, which had its first annual loss in 1988, is likely to break even this year and rebound in 1990, he said.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Leach</ENAMEX> (R.,<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>) was among those who admonished the regulators to adopt the tougher standard, even if much of the industry would currently fail to meet it. ``Don't cower to the lowest common denominator,'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leach</ENAMEX> said.
Regulators meanwhile, warned of future losses in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> because of falling real-estate prices. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> said that as a result of the deteriorating real-estate market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX>, one large institution recently ceased making real-estate loans in that area.
