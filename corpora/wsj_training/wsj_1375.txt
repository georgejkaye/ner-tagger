At a private dinner Thursday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ENAMEX>. chief executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Joseph</ENAMEX> delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> conceded the junk market was in disarray, according to people familiar with the discussion. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise.
The dinner was a stark confirmation that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $200 billion junk market. And investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve.
Amid the market disorder, even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors, is pulling in its horns. Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults, withdrawn new offerings, redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors.
For many money managers, the past four months have been humiliating. ``This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market, and it could take years before it's over,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Bachmann</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor's Corp.</ENAMEX>, a credit rating company.
In the third quarter, for example, junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns, the only major sector of the bond market to do so. Since the end of last year, junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds, including ultra-safe Treasury securities.
The junk market, which mushroomed to $200 billion from less than $2 billion at the start of the decade, has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments. The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>, which created its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing empire with more than $3 billion in junk financing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s department store chain up for sale. At that point, the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell.
In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX> says his dinner discussion with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential</ENAMEX> executives acknowledged problems for junk. ``What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and, appropriately enough, quite quality-conscious, which is not at all bad,'' he says. ``Nobody's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years, and we're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market.''
What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds. Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, where buyers and sellers are quickly matched, the junk market, where risky corporate loans are traded, is sometimes closed for repairs.
At closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deltec Securities Corp.</ENAMEX>, junk bond money managers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy K. Minella</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannah H. Strasser</ENAMEX> say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise. In recent months, they say, there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market's traditional investors, while new buyers haven't materialized to replace them.
Wall Street securities firms, ``the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market,'' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deltec</ENAMEX> said in a recent, grim report to customers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutual</ENAMEX> funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced ``above-normal'' redemptions by shareholders, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deltec</ENAMEX> said.
Investors, trying to raise cash, have sold ``large liquid issues'' such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroger Co.</ENAMEX>; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market's distress.
And, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deltec</ENAMEX> said, buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation. ``In fact, savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deltec</ENAMEX> said.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minella</ENAMEX> and Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strasser</ENAMEX> say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively, building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality.
Meanwhile, Prudential, the nation's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds, has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $6.5 billion from $7 billion since August because of falling junk prices. ``We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here, and it's something to be concerned about,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Gregoire</ENAMEX>, a managing director. ``I have no reason to think things will get worse, but this market has a knack for surprising us. This market teaches us to be humble.''
The junk market's ``yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson,'' he says.
Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default, the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart Reese</ENAMEX>, manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>'s $17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio. ``But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse. And the risks aren't appropriate for us,'' he says. The big insurer, unlike Prudential, owns only about $150 million of publicly sold junk bonds.
The string of big junk bond defaults, which have been a major cause of the market's problems this year, probably will persist, some analysts say. ``If anything, we're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Asquith</ENAMEX>, associate professor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sloan School of Management</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asquith</ENAMEX>, whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April, says this year's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings. His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34%.
One indication of a growing number of junk defaults, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asquith</ENAMEX> says, is that about half of the $3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> this year are junk bonds sold during the market's big issue years of 1984 through 1986.
These bonds, now rated single-D, include junk offerings by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP Industries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Savings</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Texas Savings Association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gilbraltar Financial Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Resources Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts International Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vyquest Inc.</ENAMEX>
``Obviously, we got [a lot more smoke] than fire from the people who told us the market wasn't so risky,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford Cornell</ENAMEX>, professor of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anderson Graduate School of Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell</ENAMEX> has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cornell</ENAMEX> says: ``The junk market is no bonanza as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> claimed, but it also isn't a disaster as the doomsayers say.''
Despite the junk market's problems, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals haven't found. During the past three weeks, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has sold $1.3 billion of new junk bonds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>, Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Air</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duff & Phelps</ENAMEX>.
Still, the list of troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on Wall Street, as does its successful offerings. Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>-underwritten issues include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts International</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Resources</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette Holdings</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Electric</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>.
``Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Holland</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc.</ENAMEX> ``But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste.
