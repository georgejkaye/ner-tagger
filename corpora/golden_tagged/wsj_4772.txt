Thanks for the enlightening page-one article about the cruel and selfish people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plentywood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mont</ENAMEX>. (``One-Horse Town Has Five Ostriches That Lay $35 Eggs,'' Aug. 21). Why don't those people get real jobs and stop mutilating, breaking up the families of, and killing animals? You reported the unfortunate answer: ``To make money.'' It's a frightening town that allows greed to rule over ethics.
