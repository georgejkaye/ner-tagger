<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia-Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX>, exceeding some analysts' expectations, said third-quarter earnings rose 56% to $178 million, or $2.03 a share, from $114 million, or $1.19 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales increased 10% to $2.65 billion from $2.41 billion.
Per-share earnings were enhanced by the company's share buy-back program, which reduced the average shares outstanding to 87.5 million in the quarter from 95.8 million in the same quarter of 1988.
With strong prices in the company's two major areas -- building products as well as pulp and paper -- analysts had expected a roaring quarter. But the performance exceeded some estimates of around $1.90 a share.
Fueling the growth, among other things, were higher-than-expected prices for certain building products. One reason: efforts to protect the spotted owl led to restrictions on logging in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Northwest</ENAMEX>, constricting supply and forcing prices up. Another reason: strikes, both at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX> and other lumber companies also cut supplies and raised prices, analysts said.
For the nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia-Pacific</ENAMEX>'s earnings increased 49% to $504 million, or $5.58 a share, from $338 million, or $3.41 a share. Sales rose 11% to $7.73 billion from $6.94 billion.
