In a startling turnabout, Members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Boren</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would undertake to warn Panamanian thug <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination.
With due respect to ``highly classified correspondence'' and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> has become a protection service for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX>, the American people ought to know. What went wrong in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naturally</ENAMEX>, Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping ``top secret'' on their own complicity. But there's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania Avenue</ENAMEX>. And if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy, it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too.
The President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> armed forces to move against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX>. When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads. The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity. But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>?
For example, what exactly did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Major Giroldi</ENAMEX> and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations? What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> in custody, but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops? Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noriega</ENAMEX> didn't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol. Maybe we need a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> version of the Miranda warning: You have the right to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you. Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confiding</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> may be fatal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Webster</ENAMEX>, hardly a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> malcontent, got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> paralysis during the coup. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s Deputy Director of Operations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Stoltz</ENAMEX>, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Webster</ENAMEX>'s point. ``The interpretation'' of the executive order, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stoltz</ENAMEX> said, ``and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me.'' In other words, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> won't let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. The pay's the same, and the duty's lighter.
And of course, doing anything that might be second-guessed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> carries heavy penalties. Witness the Walsh prosecution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ollie North</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX>'s ranking Republican, Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX>, joined with Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> to write a best seller about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Contra</ENAMEX>, deploring ``Men of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeal.</ENAMEX>'' No doubt many people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> have read it. What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who've read all this and know what can happen if they fail? Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Cohen</ENAMEX> morality play?
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> syndrome against any executive action. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s national security. There are of course good reasons the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> should start passing out exploding cigars. The world being the nasty place it is, we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed. In such situations, you can not write rules in advance, you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility.
The executive order and the reported agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Committee</ENAMEX> are neither sensible nor moral. As it now stands, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> can bomb Tripoli, but can't ``assassinate'' Colonel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gadhafi</ENAMEX>. It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bekaa Valley</ENAMEX>, but can't shoot <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Abu Nidal</ENAMEX>. Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> are telling the world that the only way the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him.
