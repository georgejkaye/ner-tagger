<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage Inc.</ENAMEX>, executing an end-run around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark Corp.</ENAMEX>'s management, said it named a dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> board member as chairman of its two subsidiaries.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX> said the board of its two subsidiaries also elected five Southmark directors as subsidiary directors, giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> directors six seats on the subsidiaries' 11-member boards.
The moves, the latest in an ongoing power struggle between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>, give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> directors control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s operating assets. But it does so without the approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>'s board or its chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur G. Weiss</ENAMEX>.
As previously reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>, which owns 62.5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>, launched a proxy fight to take control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>'s board and stop a proposed spinoff of two units to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX> shareholders.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage</ENAMEX>, a manager of nursing homes and retirement centers, said it hasn't been able to negotiate a settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX>. Elected chairman of the two subsidiaries was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert B. Parks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark W. Branigan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob J. Gaydon</ENAMEX> and two other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> directors -- who haven't yet accepted the seats -- were elected to the boards.
In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parks</ENAMEX> said the new subsidiary boards probably will proceed with the proposed spinoffs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage Medical Resources</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Heritage Healthcare Management</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> said it didn't have any immediate comment on the moves.
