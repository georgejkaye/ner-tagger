In a startling reversal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries PLC</ENAMEX> proposed a restructuring to fend off Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s # 13.35 billion ($21.14 billion) takeover bid.
The besieged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British conglomerate</ENAMEX> said it plans to break itself up by spinning off or selling about # 4 billion in assets. For sale will be its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing businesses, including its flagship <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saks Fifth Avenue</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> stores, in a transaction that could raise # 1.2 billion.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> is seeking to increase its dividend by 50% and buy back as much as 10% of its shares. The idea is to raise the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares beyond the reach of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>.
Under its proposed reshaping, the big British tobacco, financial-services, retailing and paper giant would shrink itself down to two businesses: tobacco and financial services. In the process, it would undo many of the acquisitions that over the past several years made the company <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s sixth-largest.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s move, which went further than many had expected, suggests that the current wave of takeovers sweeping <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> could lead to a radical restructuring of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European conglomerates.</ENAMEX> Takeover analysts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> said the strong B.A.T reaction marked the first time in recent memory such a large company had undertaken a massive restructuring in response to a takeover bid.
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s proposed sale of its department stores will likely increase turmoil in the retail industry by putting even more big-name retailers on the auction block. ``It's the selling of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Solomon</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investment banker who specializes in retailing. ``Never before have so many great retail assets been for sale at one time.''
Most recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> put its crown jewel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, up for sale as a result of a serious cash crunch at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> may have to sell other stores as well, analysts have said.
Earlier this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.J. Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX>, owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonwit Teller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Altman</ENAMEX>, filed for bankruptcy protection, and industry executives have speculated that one or both chains will be sold. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">May Department Stores Co.</ENAMEX> has also disclosed its interest in selling its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caldor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venture</ENAMEX> discount businesses.
The announcement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> essentially assures that the conglomerate will be dismantled, either on its own terms or those of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>. Up until yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> had steadfastly denied any suggestions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-French financier and others that it would have to take such a drastic step.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s restructuring accomplishes a big chunk of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s agenda and marks a striking about-face from earlier vows not to dismantle, it isn't clear if the moves will be sufficient to preserve the conglomerate's independence.
Besides its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX> stores, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> also would put up for sale in the U.S. its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ivey</ENAMEX>'s department-store chain and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breuners</ENAMEX>, a furniture retailer and renter.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> would divest its big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> paper businesses and U.K. retailing interests to existing shareholders through issues of new equity in the two businesses, which would be separately quoted on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> forecast a 50% dividend increase and said it was optimistic about getting approval for its buy-back proposal and the other plans at an extraordinary shareholder meeting Oct. 19.
Calling yesterday a ``sad'' day, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Sheehy</ENAMEX> said the restructuring was needed to ``address concern of shareholders about the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> businesses on the stock market compared to underlying value.'' He acknowledged that Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s intervention had put pressure on him to make this move. Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> is ``doing something about it,'' without making a big pay-out to Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> and his partners, he said in an interview.
The proposed restructuring makes the British conglomerate -- which after the move would be about two-thirds its size in annual sales and fourth-fifths its size in pre-tax profit -- ``a very good and exciting business for the 1990s and beyond,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehy</ENAMEX> said. ``It's quite clear to the market and to shareholders that the price isn't going to fall back'' to the 694-pence-a-share ($10.99-a-share) level that prevailed before Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> launched his bid in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, he contended.
Analysts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> estimated that the company's restructuring plan values each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> share at between 855 pence and 926 pence, compared with the 850-pence-a-share offer launched July 11 by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s bidding group, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investments Ltd.</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares surged as much as 44 pence to 860 pence after the announcement but lost some of the gains in a declining market to close at 818 pence, up two pence.
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> strategy puts Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> in a bind. His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake group</ENAMEX>, which includes fellow financiers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Rothschild</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kerry</ENAMEX> Packer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, can't effectively accelerate plans for a sweetened, largely cash bid to replace its current all-paper, highly leveraged offer while it remains uncertain of U.S. regulatory approval for a change in control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farmers Group Inc.</ENAMEX> insurance unit.
In an interview, Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> plan was a ``good step forward'' that he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> would support at the Oct. 19 meeting. But he said the plan ``doesn't go far enough,'' and left open the possibility he might mount a bid for the leaner, meaner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T.</ENAMEX>
``I don't believe there is any great synergy between tobacco and financial services and insurance in particular,'' he added. In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> will press ahead with efforts to secure U.S. regulatory approval. ``We say,'Well done. Keep going and you won't need to be restructured by other people if you go all the way. If you don't, other people will have to do it for you.'''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehy</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> hopes to complete its restructuring sometime early next year. He said the disposal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> retailing assets would be orderly. While declining to identify any possible buyers, he said, ``We had approaches from just about everybody for just about everything.'' Analysts have said potential bidders for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> department-store chains are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">May Department Stores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard Department Stores Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Cinema Corp.</ENAMEX>
According to sources familiar with the situation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillard</ENAMEX> contacted Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> several weeks ago and offered to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saks</ENAMEX> chain from him if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s bid for the company were successful.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Dillard</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive, declined to comment on that report. However, he said, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivey</ENAMEX>'s are all desirable properties, and we would be interested in looking at all three when they are available.''
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip B. Miller</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX>, said he intends to make ``an aggressive buy-out offer'' with other managers for the chain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saks</ENAMEX> officials declined to comment on whether they will attempt to make a management buy-out.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Field</ENAMEX>, once an erratic performer, has experienced a revival under Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>'s stewardship. The chain, whose legendary motto, ``Give the Lady What She Wants,'' had lost much of its meaning in the 1970s, now boasts a 14% market share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> area. In 1988, its 24 stores posted sales of $1.02 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Martinez</ENAMEX>, group executive for retailing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s U.S. subsidiary, said 1988 was the most profitable year in Marshall Field history. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saks</ENAMEX> performed at credible levels but didn't equal the gains at Field. He described <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breuners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivey</ENAMEX>'s as ``turnaround situations but good franchises.''
Although only two months ago <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehy</ENAMEX> had said the conglomerate could remain independent without dismantling its empire, yesterday he said the latest restructuring move ``was anticipated five years ago. Today simply hastens the process.''
So while Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> appear to have lost a battle, they may yet win the war. On the public-relations front, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> has largely accepted Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>'s controversial claim that overextended conglomerates need to ``unbundle'' to focus on fewer businesses. Meanwhile, the prospect of a takeover still remains.
Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s unusually broad response, a departure for European bids, could mean corporate raiding will produce potentially big payoffs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
That's the way Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> played it yesterday. ``I consider it a victory for our ideas. We are still in the arena and still moving forward,'' he said. He added that the increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX>'s share price since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> first began accumulating shares has about covered its costs, estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX> currently holds about 20 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> shares, valued at about # 160 million.
