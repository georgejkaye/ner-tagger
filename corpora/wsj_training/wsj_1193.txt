Good grief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Brown</ENAMEX> is selling out.
Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Life</ENAMEX> ads were bad enough. But now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Brown</ENAMEX> is about to start pitching everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chex Party</ENAMEX> Mix to light bulbs. Why is he cashing in now? Turns out that next year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Brown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Snoopy</ENAMEX> and the gang turn 40 -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripps Howard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Media</ENAMEX> unit, the syndicator and licensing agent for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schulz</ENAMEX>'s comic strip, sees a bonanza in licensing the cartoon characters to a bevy of advertisers for ads, tie-ins and promotions.
``Peanuts has become a major part of American culture,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Shore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Media</ENAMEX>'s vice president of marketing and licensing. The comic strip ``has a magical, everlasting quality about it. Our plan is to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schulz</ENAMEX> and the strip all year long.''
The effort will make the Peanuts gang very familiar pitchmen in 1990. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric</ENAMEX> plans to use the characters to plug its Miser light bulb. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teleflora</ENAMEX> will run TV ads at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valentine</ENAMEX>'s Day promoting its ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snoopy</ENAMEX>'s Love Bouquet.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralston Purina</ENAMEX> will promote its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chex Party</ENAMEX> Mix's three new flavor packets named for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Brown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linus</ENAMEX>. The characters will also be featured in a new public service effort for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way</ENAMEX>.
Beyond the advertisements, the syndicator is planning a traveling arena show, new TV specials for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> and even an exhibit at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian Institute</ENAMEX>. The yearlong schedule of festivities will be kicked off officially with a combination live and animation half-time special at the Super Bowl in January.
All the tie-ins, though, have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far. ``There are too many people participating,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Ries</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trout & Ries</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, marketing consulting firm. ``If you want to cut through the clutter, you have to make your message as distinct, sharp and individual as possible. Sharing a character with other advertisers isn't a way to do that.''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Media</ENAMEX> says it's very scrupulous with the contracts it hands out. ``We're not interested in promoting every single product that comes along,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shore</ENAMEX> says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Life</ENAMEX> ad executives couldn't be reached about the use of the Peanuts characters by others. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shore</ENAMEX> says that company's exclusive advertising rights extend only to the insurance and financial services category.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berry Rejoins WPP Group</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Berry</ENAMEX>, the creative executive who was apparently squeezed out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> in June, is returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy's</ENAMEX> parent company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group PLC</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX>, 58, had resigned after being asked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Roman</ENAMEX>, to give up his title as creative head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office and to take a fuzzier international role. Yesterday, just a day after Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> announced he would leave to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> would return to take an international role at the parent company.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> said the timing was a coincidence and that his decision was unrelated to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX>'s departure.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> awarded its national broadcast media-buying assignment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCB/Leber Katz Partners</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York outpost</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foote</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cone & Belding.</ENAMEX>
The naming of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCB/Leber Katz Partners</ENAMEX> as agency of record for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nabisco Brands Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planters Lifesavers Co.</ENAMEX> follows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX>'s announcement last week that it will disband its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Broadcast</ENAMEX> division and dismiss its 14 employees Dec. 1. to cut costs. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> wouldn't say what it spends annually, but industry executives say it will spend more than $140 million this year, down from about $200 million last year.
