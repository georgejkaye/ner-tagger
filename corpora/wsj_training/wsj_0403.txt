Seasonal Stackup
Air-traffic problems, though
often quite grim,
This time of year leave us in
stitches,
When we notice around our
airport
A holding pattern for
witches.

``I am beside myself,''
I've said in moments of
heat,
Without ever bothering To marvel at the feat.

Humility Helper
The ultimate blow to the ego
is learning that even your
mistakes go unnoticed.
