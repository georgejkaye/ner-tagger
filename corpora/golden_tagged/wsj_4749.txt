At 41, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade Whitehouse</ENAMEX> is like a baited bear. He lunges from side to side attempting to escape the torments of his life, but they are too many. He is afflicted by shame, by anger, by lost love and betrayed hopes.
At his core, he is confused and damaged beyond repair by the beatings his father inflicted and his ill-understood inability to resist. Although near-maddened by the accumulated pain, and although his struggles to free himself more often than not only turn the screws that hold him more tightly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> clings to a belief in his capacity for goodness.
If only, he thinks, he could sweep away his rage and his fear he could break free to be a good father, husband and son. ``He could become a good man. That was all he wanted, for God's sake.''
But that is out of reach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>'s wild swings only bring more pain until he becomes not a good man, but truly his father's son.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>, simultaneously repellent and deeply sympathetic, is literary kin to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dubois</ENAMEX>, the protagonist of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell Banks</ENAMEX>'s excellent ``Continental Drift.'' But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> is a greater achievement and ``Affliction'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harper & Row</ENAMEX>, 355 pages, $18.95) is an even finer novel. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX>, himself a victim of an alcoholic, abusive father, has superb command of his muscular, distinctive prose. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> strives against his afflictions, the shortness of breath is ours. From inside the chambers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>'s heart we see the walls closing in.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX>'s terrain is a landscape of limited horizons where even modest goals are unattainable. Despite the confines of their disappointed lives, however, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX>'s characters are dreamers and strivers. They've been cheated, or cheated themselves, out of a better deal in life, and they know it. They just don't understand it. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> does and he knows that people are responsible for the choices they make. He has enormous sympathy for his characters, but he doesn't let them off the hook. Bad decisions bring painful consequences. Good intentions aren't enough. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regret</ENAMEX> doesn't earn redemption.
The setting, as in earlier Banks novels, is small-town <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> bypassed by the American dream. The economic good times of the 1970s and 1980s didn't penetrate into these valleys locked in their long winters. ``For the tens of thousands of years that these narrow valleys and abrupt hillsides have been populated by human beings, life has been characterized by winter, not summer,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> writes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> and townsmen like him work at mind - and body-numbing jobs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> drives a snowplow and is the town policeman, which principally means he directs traffic outside the school early each morning), but they are distantly aware of wealth elsewhere. Poverty presses them down and makes them feel more ashamed, more inadequate.
In their financial lives these men always get the short end. They pay too much for flawed homes. Their cars constantly need repair. The free-market system may be working well elsewhere, but in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>, the human system is breaking down. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawford</ENAMEX>, 20 minutes north of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hanover</ENAMEX>, is a town in which people's dreams are dead before they are 40.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> had many dreams. And he is so brilliant a creation that a reader suffers with Wade one minute only to shake his head the next with those others in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lawford</ENAMEX> who watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>'s bad choices lead him deeper into despair. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>'s violence appalls, but he is no freak. His hopes stir recognition. The dents life has made in his spirit are familiar.
In Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX>'s world, the death of young dreams cracks the heart. Teen-age sweethearts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lillian</ENAMEX>, both children of alcoholic fathers, dreamed of escaping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawford</ENAMEX>'s patterns; dreamed they were special. ``He had promised he would not drink or fight. He had promised. Many times they had decided together that these were stupid activities, drinking and fighting, fine for their stupid insensitive friends to indulge in, perhaps, but not for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade Whitehouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lillian Pittman</ENAMEX>, who were superior to all that, who were finer, nobler, more intelligent than their friends. Because they had each other, they did not need anyone else; they believed that.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> struggled so hard against the trap of Lawford life, but now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawford</ENAMEX> has corralled him and the young, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Hewitt</ENAMEX>, cringe at becoming Wade: ``... the idea of ending up in your forties living a life like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>'s made him shudder and avert his gaze and go quickly back to talking about baseball.''
``Affliction'' is told by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>'s younger brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolfe</ENAMEX>, who escaped the poverty and violence of Lawford by going to college and becoming a high school teacher in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> suburbs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>'s story, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolfe</ENAMEX> explains, ``is my ghost life.'' Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>, he says, ``I have been ashamed and angry practically since birth'' and thus is uniquely qualified to tell the tale.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX>'s undoing is an unrelenting story set against a backbeat of rifle fire from the hills. Deer season opens as ``Affliction'' begins and closes as the novel ends. As his life is falling apart, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wade</ENAMEX> is determined to understand a killing that took place in the woods near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lawford</ENAMEX>.
He can not, of course, understand the central mystery of ``Affliction.'' What happened to his life?
In the fullness and the power with which it answers that question, ``Affliction'' achieves its brilliance.
