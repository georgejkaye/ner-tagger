<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> said it lowered the ratings of some $145 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinnacle</ENAMEX> debt because of ``accelerating deficiency in liquidity,'' which it said was evidenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinnacle</ENAMEX>'s elimination of dividend payments. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Sargent Jr.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pinnacle</ENAMEX> executive vice president, said the action ``won't really have any effect on us.
