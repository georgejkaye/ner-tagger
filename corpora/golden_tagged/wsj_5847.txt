A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesleyan University</ENAMEX> student filed suit against his school and 11 other private colleges seeking damages on behalf of thousands of students hurt in an alleged tuition price-fixing scheme.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, was the first in what could be a series of actions by students at schools whose practices of setting tuitions, financial-aid awards and salaries are under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> scrutiny. The legal action complicates the settlement hopes of some of the schools, who have been counting on resolving the federal case without a trial.
The student, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Kingsepp</ENAMEX>, said the defendants, representing ``the market of Ivy League and upper-echelon schools,'' have ``engaged in a conspiracy to fix or artificially inflate the price of tuition and financial aid.'' The suit seeks triple damages under federal anti-price-fixing laws for overcharges, on behalf of a class of all students who were allegedly harmed by the scheme.
The defendants named by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kingsepp</ENAMEX> -- including all eight Ivy League schools -- have each received civil investigative demands for financial information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>. The 12 defendant schools enroll about 125,000 students. They include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesleyan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale University</ENAMEX>, both in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amherst College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Williams College</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell universities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. Also named were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Providence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.I.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dartmouth College</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hanover</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.H.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton University</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>.
Late Friday, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesleyan</ENAMEX> spokesman said the university hadn't seen the suit, but believed it ``to be without merit'' based on a description of the allegations. All the other defendants either couldn't be reached for comment, or declined comment because they hadn't seen the suit.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kingsepp</ENAMEX> charged that the defendants engage in exchanges of information ``that are routine, systematic and designed to eliminate any real price choices'' for students. The lawsuit heavily cited practices and documents disclosed originally in this newspaper, including an internal Wesleyan rundown of proposed 1988-89 charges at competitor schools. The document stated that the information was confidential and obtained before schools made their final decisions on tuition charges.
Except <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stanford</ENAMEX>, every school named in the lawsuit also participates in an ``overlap'' practice that establishes financial aid awards for students who are admitted. The lawsuit called the practice, which results in identical family expenses no matter where the student goes, as ``unlawful.'' It didn't set a specific figure for the damages it seeks.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, has widened the scope of its probe significantly -- and may broaden it even further. Last week, it acknowledged sending a second wave of civil-investigative demands, after disclosing in August that the requests had gone to about 20 schools. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> spokesperson said more requests may still be made. So far, at least 27 schools have acknowledged getting the requests, including the defendants in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kingsepp</ENAMEX>'s suit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, and several women's colleges.
