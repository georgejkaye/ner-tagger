<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAL Acquisition</ENAMEX>, a group headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter V. Ueberroth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Thomas Talbott</ENAMEX>, said it will extend its $22-a-share tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAL Inc.</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiian Airlines</ENAMEX>, if it can reach new work accords with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX>-based company's unions.
In a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> filing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAL Acquisition</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newport Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, said the extension of the tender offer, which was scheduled to expire tomorrow, was contingent upon obtaining union agreements and financing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAL Acquisition</ENAMEX> is actively negotiating with union representatives and that for agreements to be ``reasonably satisfactory,'' it wants five-year pacts with no wage increases for the first three years, the filing said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAL Acquisition</ENAMEX> won't require wage concessions but will require significant work-rule changes to permit more ``rational and efficient'' use of personnel to increase productivity 30%, the filing said.
Among other things, these work-rule changes would require an increase of about 20% in actual flying time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawaiian Airlines</ENAMEX> pilots, the filing said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAL Acquisition</ENAMEX> said its goal is to produce savings of about $6 million over three to five years.
The filing also said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAL Inc.</ENAMEX> would incur ``substantial'' additional debt in the next 12 to 18 months for working capital and equipment to support its business operations.
If the labor negotiations are resolved, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAL Acquisition</ENAMEX> said it will extend its tender offer until after a special shareholders meeting. It also said it expects senior management changes.
