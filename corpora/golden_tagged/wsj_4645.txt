<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin Group</ENAMEX>, the French company known for making high-priced tires for luxury cars, is taking some unique marketing risks in marrying middlebrow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> could damage the elite name it has long cultivated as it attempts to capture the lower-priced tire market that other tire-makers shun. ``They'll have to be careful that they don't tarnish their hard fought-for reputation and mystique,'' contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Millis</ENAMEX>, a tire-industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>.
In addition, the proposed $690 million acquisition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s second largest tire producer is likely to trigger a brutal price war among the top four producers as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> fights to increase its presence in the robust North American market. With the Uniroyal takeover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> would surpass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.</ENAMEX> as the world's No. 1 tire-maker, but also assume an additional $810 million in debt and undisclosed pension liabilities.
Even as raw-material costs soared last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> slashed prices on tires just to win coveted market share at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> That forced similar price-cutting on tires shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> Sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> are important, because new-car buyers tend to replace original equipment tires with the same brand.
``The price wars will be phenomenal,'' predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch Urbanski</ENAMEX>, an automotive consultant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportek Inc.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Troy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>
Auto makers this year are paying less for tires on the 1990 model year than they did on the 1988 model year, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Descenza</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Springdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, independent automotive analyst. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal Goodrich</ENAMEX> officials declined to be interviewed.
With the planned acquisition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> would about double its market share at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>. According to figures from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Tire Dealer</ENAMEX>, a trade publication, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin / Uniroyal Goodrich</ENAMEX> would supply an estimated 45% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s passenger and light truck tire needs.
But retaining its dominant position with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> is far from assured, acknowledges <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Charles Ames</ENAMEX>, a partner at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investment firm that's selling Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>. He expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> to buy more tires from other producers to lessen its dependence on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>\. ``They'll probably want to balance out the shares and not let one guy get way up there.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has a policy of not commenting on its relationships with suppliers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conceivably</ENAMEX>, such a situation might help unit volume at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodyear</ENAMEX>, which last year supplied 25% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s passenger-tire needs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Tire & Rubber Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. General last year supplied 18% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s tires, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modern Tire Dealer</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bridgestone Corp.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, supplied 18.5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s tires in 1988 but was being phased out as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> announced a move to reduce the number of its suppliers.
With Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich</ENAMEX> under its wing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> also is expected to try to increase its share at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>, says automotive consultant Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urbanski</ENAMEX>. (At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>, the tire market share is more evenly distributed, with the dominant position held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firestone)</ENAMEX>. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodyear</ENAMEX> is vulnerable, because last year it supplied 86% of the auto maker's passenger tires, with the rest supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urbanski</ENAMEX> believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> will use its own name as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich T</ENAMEX>/A brand, popular among sporty car enthusiasts, to try to increase market share at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich T</ENAMEX>/A line is already original equipment on some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> Jeep products.
But the French company may phase out the Uniroyal brand name. ``It will fall by the wayside in a few years,'' predicts Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urbanski</ENAMEX>. ``It's just another tire.'' He notes that Uniroyal tires already have taken a back seat to Goodrich in national advertising.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company intends to keep both Uniroyal and Goodrich tires. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uniroyal Goodrich</ENAMEX>, which has been strapped for cash, had trouble supporting two brands and this year earmarked most of its national ad budget on Goodrich tires.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> may also have to spend considerable amounts of money to modernize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uniroyal Goodrich</ENAMEX>'s aging plants. If it doesn't, contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcdonald</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millis</ENAMEX>, it could damage its 50-year-old prestige image and reputation for quality.
This week Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodrich</ENAMEX> executives are touring the country, meeting with dealers. So far, they have received positive feedback about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX>'s proposed acquisition, a spokesman for the company says.
``Uniroyal has been struggling with national advertising, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> is a stable, big-time player,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Emery</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hombre Tire Centers</ENAMEX>, an independent distributer of Uniroyal tires in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>. ``They bring a lot of assets to the table, and they have a mystique.'' But independent analyst Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Descenza</ENAMEX> notes that if there's a recession in the next two years, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michelin</ENAMEX> could be squeezed for cash trying to service its own debt as well as that of Uniroyal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodrich</ENAMEX>.
