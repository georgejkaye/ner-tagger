<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada Inc.</ENAMEX> said the conclusion of its restructuring will probably be delayed as many as two weeks because of the recent tumult in the junk bond market.
The delay stems from the financing to be arranged for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztar Corp.</ENAMEX>, the new company that will operate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada</ENAMEX>'s gambling operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> is expected to underwrite an offering of high-yield notes: $170 million in first mortgage notes, $130 million in senior subordinated reset notes and $100 million in senior subordinated notes as part of the financing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Rubeli</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada</ENAMEX>'s gambling operations, called the delay an unforseen but minor hitch similar to the slight delay in getting the transaction approved by state casino regulators. When the transaction is completed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aztar</ENAMEX> stock will begin trading over the counter under the symbol <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AZTR</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> has agreed to sell its lodging business to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World Development Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime Motor Inns Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, for $540 million. The final step of the restructuring will be the merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> and a subsidiary of New World, and the distribution to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada</ENAMEX> shareholders of cash and stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aztar</ENAMEX>.
The company had previously planned to finish the restructuring by today. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada</ENAMEX>'s stock closed at $14, up 12.5 cents in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
