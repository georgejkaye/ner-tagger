<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.J. Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> has decided against opening its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B. Altman & Co.</ENAMEX> store in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walden Galleria</ENAMEX> mall in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX>,
In August, L.J. Hooker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Its parent company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hooker Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, also is being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Capital Corp.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>, agreed to purchase as much as $75 million in receivables from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Altman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonwit Teller</ENAMEX> chains. Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonwit Teller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Altman</ENAMEX> are servicing their credit-card customers and will continue to so.
The $75 million agreement is distinct from an earlier agreement under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> Capital is providing as much as $50 million in debtor-in-possession financing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.J. Hooker</ENAMEX>'s various divisions.
