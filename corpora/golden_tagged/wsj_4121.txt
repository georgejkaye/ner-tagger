There's nothing like a snake or two slithering around a moviegoer's feet to put a crimp in box office sales.
Such are the guerrilla tactics of a movie-distribution war in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>. But they haven't stopped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike S. Pae</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> is the general manager in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International Pictures</ENAMEX>, a joint venture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Studios</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX> that directly distributes the studios' movies abroad.
Selling U.S. movies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> looked like it would be relatively easy. The studios were offering a popular product that consumers wanted, and the government was promising to finally remove barriers.
But beginning with the first exhibits last year, South Korean theaters that dared to show <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International</ENAMEX> releases such as ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Rain Man'' were met by picketers and signs declaring ``Yankee Go Home'' and ``Stop Cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invasion.</ENAMEX>'' Protesters released snakes inside the movie houses, sending audiences fleeing. In theaters not adhering to a boycott of the venture's films, tear gas  bombs were set off and screens were vandalized. One theater was firebombed last month.
The dispute has little to do with anti-Americanism. It boils down to money. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX>'s work was disrupting the cozy cartel of producers and directors that for almost two decades had a government-sanctioned lock on the distribution of foreign films. ``They were making tons of money,'' he explains. ``Now they aren't.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX>, a burly Korean-American who fancies Italian-cut suits, has met the intimidation squarely.
Thanks in large measure to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX>'s persistence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> studios are making headway against protests and wedging into the South Korean movie market, which has potential to grow far beyond its $120 million in ticket sales a year. Theater owners who once opposed the newcomers -- out of both loyalty to and fear of the cartel -- are showing the films. U.S. movies are flowing in. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century Fox</ENAMEX> recently opened an office, and other major studios are expected to follow. Theaters are being built or renovated to meet growing demand. South Korean newspapers have lifted their ban on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International</ENAMEX>'s ads. And the police have started arresting those allegedly involved in intimidating theater owners and audiences.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> ``made things happen,'' a U.S. official says.
In fact, how Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> is getting U.S. movies shown may provide lessons for other businesses facing tough times in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>. Increasingly, local businesses -- such as farmers, bankers and the government cigarette maker -- have been wrapping themselves in a cloak of anti-American rhetoric to keep U.S. business out. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX>'s difference wasn't so much in what he did as in what he didn't do: He didn't run.
U.S. movies have never been banned in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>, a fact that blows a hole in the protesters' argument. ``The cultural invasion argument doesn't make sense. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koreans</ENAMEX> have been importing American movies all along,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung Jin Woo</ENAMEX>, a well-known movie producer/director who now exhibits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International</ENAMEX> films. ``There is no difference between Koreans doing it and Americans doing it.''
Except for who makes the profit. As recently as 1987, only about two dozen foreign movies were allowed into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> annually, and then only through the cartel. A cartel member could buy the rights for a major movie such as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaws II</ENAMEX>'' for as little as $300,000. The movie, which could easily sell $2 million of tickets, would then be auctioned off to a theater.
The producers were supposed to plow the profits from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> movies back into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>'s embryonic film industry. But profits were often put into real estate or other ventures.
``In 20 years, the quality of Korean movies never improved,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jo Young Taek</ENAMEX>, a food company salesman and movie fan who had just taken his family to see ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indiana Jones</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Last Crusade</ENAMEX>,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International</ENAMEX> release.
U.S. studios tried and failed to get a foot in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> in 1971. Then in 1985, the Reagan administration made movies a trade issue. It wasn't until <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> threatened retaliatory tariffs on South Korean videocassette recorders that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> government promised to open the market to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> studios.
In 1987, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International</ENAMEX> set up an office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> and hired the gravel-voiced Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX>, who had a good perspective on the cartel: He had been part of it, negotiating film rights for members. ``I know them well,'' he says. ``These are my friends.''
He also understood the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and loved its movies. The 50-year-old had moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> as a student in 1961, later working as a film editor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>. A U.S. citizen since 1972, he also dabbled in the video-rental business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> saw it, the way to break the boycott was to convince theater owners that they could make more money through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International.</ENAMEX> Theaters often couldn't recoup the money paid to the cartel for prize U.S. exhibition rights. Thus, many movie houses often got by with low-grossing Israeli beach-party movies or kung-fu flicks from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>.
Rather than charge for rights, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> offered to split the box office take, with theaters getting 40%. Even so, recruits at first were hard to come by. The cartel allegedly was threatening to blackmail some theater owners, mostly over past tax evasion, if they signed with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX>, whose favorite movie is ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Godfather</ENAMEX>,'' played tough. His staff videotaped the protests. He met repeatedly with newspapers that had refused to take his movie ads. He went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economic Planning Board</ENAMEX>, the powerful haven of the nation's technocrats, and to the police, who used trade, anti-extortion and other laws against the cartel.
The cartel and leaders of the boycott haven't admitted using threats, snakes or attacks and have refused repeated requests for interviews. Several cartel members are hiding from the police.
Meanwhile, some opponents say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> employed the same dubious tactics. There are allegations, which the police and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> call false, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International</ENAMEX> was behind the theater firebombing and the beating of a protest ringleader. ``We haven't done any retaliatory action or anything,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX>. ``We are just here to do business.''
Oddly enough, he says he's still friendly with his former employers. ``When we get together we have drinks, conversations, nice times,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> says. ``But when it comes to business, it is different.'' Asked whether he would use snakes and similar tactics on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International</ENAMEX> if he still worked for the cartel, he replies, ``No comment.''
Because the market is open now, the cartel's future is uncertain. Individual members still import movies on their own, particularly from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, which has 40% of the foreign-movie market. Meanwhile, the boycott is fading and protests have died down since last month, although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> fears a resurgence.
It's been worth the trouble. Under the old system, rights to ``Rain Man,'' for instance, would have sold for about $750,000. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United International</ENAMEX>, the studio's share was about $2 million. Still, there's one movie that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pae</ENAMEX> is reluctant to bring to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>: the controversial ``Last Temptation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christ.</ENAMEX>'' He says, ``I've had enough protests as it is.
