<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts International Inc.</ENAMEX>, the casino company owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merv Griffin</ENAMEX>, unveiled a restructuring plan aimed at keeping the company out of bankruptcy-law proceedings.
Angry bondholders at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, meeting immediately attacked the proposal and predicted it would fail. ``There's a high likelihood this will end up in Chapter 11,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Jacobs</ENAMEX>, first vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Capital Funding.</ENAMEX>
The proposal calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic City</ENAMEX>, to swap its $925 million in secured and unsecured bonds for new secured subordinated debentures, cash and stock. It would allow Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin</ENAMEX> some time to sell off assets and shore up operations, but also requires the approval of 90% of the bondholders.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>, which announced a moratorium on bond payments Aug. 28, is one of several recent leveraged buy-outs financed by junk bonds that is crumbling under a crushing debt load. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David P. Hanlon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>' president, blamed some of the company's problems on former owners but said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Resorts</ENAMEX>' value is ``diminished'' without current management.
``In the absence of a consensual restructuring, this company is headed toward insolvency,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Higgins</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Bros.</ENAMEX>, said in an interview. ``Bankruptcy could be catastrophic, so we're asking everyone to take a hit.''
But many junior and senior bondholders, who have split into two factions, argued that the plan doesn't treat all parties fairly. They noted that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin</ENAMEX> would retain 75% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>' equity, and contended that that their risk is substantially higher.
Some also criticized Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanlon</ENAMEX>'s $1.5 million 1989 salary, and accused management of not making the same sacrifices as the debtholders. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin</ENAMEX>, who was negotiating a game-show pilot, didn't attend the meeting.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin</ENAMEX> bought the company for $365 million last November after a takeover battle with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>. The businessman and entertainer apparently won't inject any more cash beyond his initial $50 million investment.
When he bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin</ENAMEX> issued, through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>, $325 million of senior debt secured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>' properties in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic City</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bahamas</ENAMEX>. The restructuring plan proposes that the debt be swapped for the following:
-- For 13 7/8% mortgage notes due 1998: New 10% Series B notes, with payment-in-kind option allowing the company to issue more debt in lieu of cash interest payments for the first three years.
-- For 13 1/2% senior secured reset notes: New 10% Series A notes, with payment-in-kind option allowing the company to issue more debt in lieu of cash for three years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX> would have the option of buying back both issues, beginning Dec. 1, 1990, for 75% of principal amount, in essence automatically discounting the bonds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX> also has $600 million of unsecured junior debt outstanding at interest rates ranging from 10% to 16 5/8%. The company proposed that the issues be swapped for:
-- Ten-year debentures equal to 70% of the bonds' original principal minus the original bonds' discount, yielding 7% for the first three years and 8% thereafter. Under a payment-in-kind option, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX> could issue bonds in lieu of cash payments for five years.
-- Equity securities equal to 25% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>' fully diluted common stock and 10% of the bonds' old principal, or $60 million.
Company officials conceded privately that the restructuring plan is only an opening gambit, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX> faces other major hurdles, such as bondholder lawsuits. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griffin</ENAMEX> must appear before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> casino regulators next Monday for licensing, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>' current casino license is scheduled for renewal in February.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Parrillo</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">state</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaming Enforcement</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX> will have to present a contingency plan to ensure the company's financial stability during any restructuring.
For the first half of 1989, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX> reported a net loss of $46.6 million on revenue of $223.6 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts</ENAMEX>'  flagship casino here has lost market share throughout the peak summer months, the local market's strongest season.
Bondholders arriving for the meeting were shocked to see bright yellow buckets collecting rainwater leaking from the roof in the casino's lobby. ``Things were going very well until... last year,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> woman whose $10,000 investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Resorts</ENAMEX> bonds is worth about $2,800 at current market values.
