I was surprised to read the article by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Moffett</ENAMEX> (``Crippling Export: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital</ENAMEX> Flight Still Racks Economy, Despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady Plan</ENAMEX>,'' Sept. 23.) It seemed to me particularly inappropriate at this time, since it would suggest that capital flight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> continues unabated.
You should know better. As statements by the director general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX> have indicated, capital inflows during the first seven months of 1989 amounted to some $2.3 billion. This figure shows that despite the examples cited, on balance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mexicans</ENAMEX> have repatriated capital.
Deriving general conclusions from a few interviews largely with people interested in sustaining capital outflows, while ignoring available information on the subject as a whole, is at best a questionable practice. In fact, the indirect impact of the debt accord on the expectations as risks and uncertainties declined has allowed domestic interest rates to fall sharply, thus providing much needed relief to domestic debt service and improving the climate for investment.
