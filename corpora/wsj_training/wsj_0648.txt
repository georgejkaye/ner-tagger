<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> may see claims resulting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> earthquake totaling nearly $1 billion -- far less than the claims they face from Hurricane Hugo -- but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months.
The property claims service division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Insurance Services Group</ENAMEX> estimated insured losses from the earthquake at $960 million. This estimate doesn't include claims under workers' compensation, life, health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges, highways and public buildings.
The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $4 billion in claims that insurers face from Hurricane Hugo, which ripped through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX> last month. That's because only about 30% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses.
However, insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> area earthquake, Hugo and last week's explosion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phillips Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX>'s refinery in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pasadena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump.
Other insurance rates such as casualty insurance, which would cover liability claims, aren't likely to firm right away, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Cornish</ENAMEX>, an industry analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northington Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX> She believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes isn't likely to halt the growth of the industry's surplus capital next year.
Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first, analysts and brokers believe. ``The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Rosencrants</ENAMEX>, director of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses. Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company, which, in turn, accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurers</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transamerica Corp, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co.</ENAMEX>, buy reinsurance from other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based companies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd's</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> for one catastrophe at a time.
After Hugo hit, many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap reinsurers to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year.
After the earthquake two weeks ago, brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyd</ENAMEX>'s syndicates turned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> market excess lines for protection of their own.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Snedeker</ENAMEX>, senior vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gill & Roeser Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based reinsurance broker, says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990. However, companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly. Many companies will be negotiating their 1990 reinsurance contracts in the next few weeks.
``It's a seller's market,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snedeker</ENAMEX> of the reinsurance market right now.
But some large insurers, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, don't purchase reinsurance, but fund their own program. A few years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX>, the nation's largest home insurer, stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure. The $472 million of losses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> expects from Hugo and an additional $300 million from the earthquake are less than 5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX>'s $16.7 billion total net worth.
Since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake, it's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake's impact on fourth-quarter earnings, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Goodfriend</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transamerica</ENAMEX> expects an after-tax charge of less than $3 million against fourth-quarter net; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hartford Insurance Group</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITT Corp.</ENAMEX>, expects a $15 million or 10 cents after-tax charge; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fireman's Fund Corp.</ENAMEX> expects a charge of no more than $50 million before taxes and after using its reinsurance.
