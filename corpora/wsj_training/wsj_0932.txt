The amount of blood surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPO</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPO</ENAMEX>, or erythropoietin, is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells. A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thousand Oaks</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, recently has been marketed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ortho Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson & Johnson</ENAMEX>. A competing version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPO</ENAMEX> is being developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics Institute Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX> The drug is being used primarily to treat anemias.
A new experiment, reported in this week's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX>, involved giving injections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amgen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPO</ENAMEX> to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood.
The patients began receiving EPO injections about a month before their scheduled surgery. They then began donating blood twice a week, receiving an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPO</ENAMEX> injection each time. If tests indicated a low number of red cells, blood wasn't taken.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPO</ENAMEX>-treated patients donated an average of 5.4 units of blood each compared with only 4.1 units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a placebo injection. The volume of red cells donated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPO</ENAMEX>-treated patients was 41% higher per donor, the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported.
