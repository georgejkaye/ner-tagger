The management turnover at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok International Ltd.</ENAMEX> continued with the resignation of company president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Joseph Labonte</ENAMEX>, who joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> just two years ago.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labonte</ENAMEX>'s departure follows by two months the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Goldston</ENAMEX> as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX>.
The resignations by the two executives, considered hard-charging and abrasive by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> insiders, reflect a difference in style with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Fireman</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive, according to several former executives. The two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $1.79 billion.
The changes come as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX>, which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late, is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.A. Gear Inc.</ENAMEX>
The departures, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Ruth</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montgomery Securities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences. ``I think it's more an issue of style. I would view it as a net positive. The company can go about its business. They're in the midst of a turnaround,'' she noted.
Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20% decline last year.
A former executive agreed that the departures don't reflect major problems, adding: ``If you see any company that grows as fast as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> did, it is going to have people coming and going.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labonte</ENAMEX> will resume the presidency of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vantage Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983. Before that he was president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reebok</ENAMEX> added that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fireman</ENAMEX> will assume the title of president.
A spokesman said that neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fireman</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Labonte</ENAMEX> would be available for comment. ``We will not be commenting beyond the news release,'' the spokesman said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldston</ENAMEX>, who had been president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faberge Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Faberge U.S.A.</ENAMEX> division before joining Reebok in September 1988, left in August to pursue other interests.
