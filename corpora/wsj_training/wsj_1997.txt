<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blinder International Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX>, the parent of beleaguered penny-stockbroker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blinder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robinson & Co.</ENAMEX>, said its shareholders approved a previously announced name change to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intercontinental Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX>
``The parent company is diversifying into other industries around the world,'' said president Meyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blinder</ENAMEX> in explaining the name change. ``Everytime we talked about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blinder International</ENAMEX>, {people} thought it was the brokerage house.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blinder</ENAMEX> said the change wasn't related to the brokerage's recent troubles, which have included sharp declines in earnings, run-ins with the securities regulators and lawsuits by former customers.
The company said it expects the name change to take effect within a week.
