Residents of this city soon will be seeing ads urging them to visit ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>'s outdoor museum'' -- Lake View <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cemetery</ENAMEX>.
Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D. Rockefeller</ENAMEX>, Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times. So the inner-city burial ground is trying to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign.
The ads celebrate the achievements of some of Lake View's residents. A spot honoring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill White</ENAMEX>, the inventor of chewing gum, shows a woman trying to extricate her high-heeled shoe from a wad of gum.
Another focuses on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Brush</ENAMEX>, the first person to light a city electrically. It shows a boy hurling rocks at a street lamp. Street lights, the ad points out, ``helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cemetery</ENAMEX> officials hope the ads, which will begin airing next month, will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions. Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery.
The private, non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts, which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots. ``We don't want to be known as ambulance chasers,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Garrison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake View</ENAMEX>'s president. ``We want people to think of Lake View as an historical park and educational experience.... A pleasant place to come and spend a few hours.''
Not all of the cemetery's better-known tenants lend themselves to the promotional job at hand, however. For example, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Garfield</ENAMEX> is entombed here, the victim of an assassination in 1881. (Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garrison</ENAMEX> notes, however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garfield</ENAMEX> tomb is one of the nation's premier examples of Romanesque architecture.)
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rockefeller</ENAMEX>, buried beneath a 180-foot-tall granite obelisk, didn't seem right for an ad either. The oil magnate, who spent his later years passing out dimes to counter his penny-pinching image, ``isn't terribly amusing,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Olson</ENAMEX>, creative director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Innis-Maggiore-Olson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, which is producing the ads. But there are plenty of other promising prospects at Lake View, promoters believe: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Ball</ENAMEX>, for instance, who wrote ``When Irish Eyes are Smiling,'' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garrett Morgan</ENAMEX>, the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light.
