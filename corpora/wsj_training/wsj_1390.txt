<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maidenform Inc.</ENAMEX> loves to be intimate with its customers, but not with the rest of the public.
The 67-year-old maker of brassieres, panties, and lingerie enjoys one of the best-known brand images, but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family. ``There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Brawer</ENAMEX>, 52 years old, recently named president, succeeding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beatrice Coleman</ENAMEX>, his mother-in-law, who remains chairman. ``We are a vanishing breed,'' he muses.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX>, 73, who declined to be interviewed, is the Maidenform strategist. Sales have tripled during her 21-year tenure to about $200 million in 1988. Maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics.
The company sells image. Its current ad campaign, on which Maidenform has spent more than $15 million since fall 1987, doesn't even show its underwear products, but rather men like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Reeve</ENAMEX>, star of the ``Superman'' movies, talking about their lingerie turn-ons.
The Maidenform name ``is part of American pop culture,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Sinopoli</ENAMEX>, account supervisor of the campaign by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huntley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schmidt & Beaver</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> ad firm. Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as ``I dreamed I... in my Maidenform bra,'' and ``The Maidenform woman. You never know where she'll turn up.''
``Capitalizing on the brand is key,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX>, whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the U.S.
``The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly {Maidenform} is a force to be reckoned with,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David S. Leibowitz</ENAMEX>, a special situations analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. Although working women are ``forced to wear the uniform of the day, to retain their femininity they are buying better quality, more upscale intimate apparel,'' he said.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX>'s appointment as president was long expected, the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Lesk</ENAMEX> as senior vice president of sales and merchandising. Three days later, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> was named president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olga Co.</ENAMEX>, a competing intimate apparel division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warnaco Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warnaco</ENAMEX> also owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warners</ENAMEX>, another major intimate apparel maker.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached to comment. But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at Maidenform, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX>, 48, made it clear he wanted the top job. ``If you want the presidency of the company, this isn't the firm to work for,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Mogan</ENAMEX>, 45, who was named senior vice president of sales, assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX>.
The company downplayed the loss of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesk</ENAMEX> and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people. ``My style is less informal,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> says.
Top officers insist Maidenform's greatest strength is its family ownership. ``You can't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart,'' one delights. ``It is fun competing as a private company,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> says. ``You can think long range.''
Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warnaco</ENAMEX> was taken private by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrum Group</ENAMEX> in 1986 for about $487 million. And last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playtex Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> went private for about $680 million. It was then split into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Playtex Apparel Inc.</ENAMEX>, the intimate apparel division, and Playtex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Products Corp.</ENAMEX>, which makes tampons, hair-care items and other products. Publicly traded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VF Corp.</ENAMEX>, which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanity Fair</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sara Lee Corp.</ENAMEX>, which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali Co.</ENAMEX>, are also strong forces in intimate apparel.
Buy-out offers for Maidenform aren't infrequent, says Executive Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David C. Masket</ENAMEX>, but they aren't taken very seriously. When he gets calls, ``I don't even have to consult'' with Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Masket</ENAMEX> says.
The company could command a good price in the market. ``Over the past three and a half years, apparel companies, many of whom have strong brand names, have been bought at about 60% of sales,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Bronston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> apparel analyst.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX>, along with Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> and her daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Elizabeth</ENAMEX>, an attorney who is vice chairman, are the family members involved in the operations of Maidenform, which employs about 5,000. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX>'s wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catherine</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stroup</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Elizabeth</ENAMEX>'s husband, round out the five-member board. Each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings. ``We are all very amiable,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> says.
Executives say Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX> is very involved in the day-to-day operations, especially product development. In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales.
Her father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rosenthal</ENAMEX>, designed the then-dress making company's first bra in the 1920s, which he said gave women a ``maiden form'' compared with the ``boyish form'' they got from the ``flat bandages'' used for support at the time. While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenthal</ENAMEX> introduced new undergarment designs, his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ida</ENAMEX>, concentrated on sales and other financial matters. The name Maidenform was coined by a third business partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enid Bissett</ENAMEX>.
The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX>.
Maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores, but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Neb.</ENAMEX>, and has 24 factory outlets, with plans to add more.
Before joining Maidenform in 1972, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX>, who holds a doctoral degree in English from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Chicago</ENAMEX>, taught at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Wisconsin</ENAMEX>. As a senior vice president, he has headed the company's designer lingerie division, Oscar de la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renta</ENAMEX>, since its inception in 1988. To maintain exclusivity of that designer line, it isn't labeled with the Maidenform name.
While the company has always been family-run, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brawer</ENAMEX> isn't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head Maidenform. Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coleman</ENAMEX>'s husband, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph</ENAMEX>, a physician, succeeded Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosenthal</ENAMEX> as president and served in that post until his death in 1968.
