<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fall</ENAMEX>'s Alarm
Dear baseball team, you've been supreme
This doubting fan you've shocked
With joy I wept in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aug.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sept</ENAMEX>.
And prayed for a great Oct.

To the politician a sin tax,
Is one that rarely will hurt you,
For it painlessly brings in more cash,
Than would a tax on virtue.
