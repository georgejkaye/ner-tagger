<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Healthvest</ENAMEX> said two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said they may take actions to recover their loans.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Healthvest</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, real estate investment trust, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Bank</ENAMEX>, the lead bank under its domestic bank agreement, told it that if $3.3 million owed to the bank group isn't paid by today, the group will call the $120 million that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Healthvest</ENAMEX> has outstanding under the credit line. The bank group also said that it won't make additional advances under the $150 million credit line.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Healthvest</ENAMEX> missed a payment to the group that was due in late September.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Healthvest</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Tokyo Trust Co.</ENAMEX> also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Healthvest</ENAMEX> missed an interest payment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> on Oct. 1.
