<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International Corp.</ENAMEX>, maintaining that it is ``caught in the middle of an inter-governmental feud'' over waste disposal at the Rocky Flats nuclear-weapons plant, sued the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX>.
The unprecedented action could have tremendous significance for other bomb-plant contractors that believe they face a Hobson's choice similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>'s.
The heart of the issue, in the company's eyes, is this: It can keep manufacturing the nation's supply of plutonium triggers at Rocky Flats, thereby generating waste that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> has conceded can not legally be stored anywhere. Or it can suspend operations, as it has threatened, and possibly be charged with default on its contract with the government.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> and it's employees currently find themselves between a rock and a hard place,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George B. Merrick</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> vice president who oversees safety matters at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Flats</ENAMEX>, said in the court papers.
The suit, entered in federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, asks for a judge to spell out both the government's and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>'s obligations under the pact. It also seeks injunctive relief, yet it's unclear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Segundo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>-based company can ever obtain what it's really after: total assurance that it won't be prosecuted.
``A judge can only uphold the law, and there's nothing in the law that grants immunity from criminal prosecution,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shira Flax</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based expert on nuclear-weapons plants.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>'s chief aim, she added, appears to be the protection of employees who sign day-to-day administrative reports, many of which were seized by investigators during a June raid of Rocky Flats and are now under the scrutiny of a federal grand jury.
But one Bush administration official said the government is worried that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> might have a hidden agenda: pulling out of Rocky Flats altogether. A judicial order to close the plant, he said, would be much better for the defense contractor's image than a move to shut it down on its own.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>, however, insisted that it had filed suit ``very reluctantly'' and only after ``extensive efforts'' to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> ``resolve the inconsistent and conflicting demands being placed on'' the company.
In an affidavit used to support the June raid, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of</ENAMEX> Investigation alleged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> had dumped toxic chemicals into waterways near Rocky Flats and had burned hazardous waste in an incinerator that was supposed to be idled. Last week, the company announced that an internal investigation had found those charges to be baseless.
But the bulk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s contentions centered around violations of federal waste-storage and disposal statutes -- and that's what yesterday's suit takes on.
In particular, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> said that trigger production at Rocky Flats inevitably results in the accumulation of low-level mixed waste, a combination of radioactive and hazardous materials. Compliance with federal land-disposal restrictions, the company said, is ``currently impossible'' because there is no government or commercial facility that can treat the substance.
The company said similar dilemmas exist at Rocky Flats with regard to residue in a shuttered plutonium-recovery incinerator and waste water in a liquid treatment building.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> said in the suit that until recently, it had been led to believe by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> that the company would not be ``subject to legal liability'' as long as it made a good-faith effort to carry out its contract at Rocky Flats.
Yet in the past few months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> added, it has become clear that it may be prosecuted. It cited numerous letters to and from high-level government officials, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> Administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Reilly</ENAMEX>, Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">General Dick Thornburgh</ENAMEX> and Energy Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Watkins</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathaniel Miullo</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> official who directly oversees compliance at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Flats</ENAMEX>, said he thinks the company is basically sincere in crying Catch-22. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> has its statutory responsibility, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOE</ENAMEX> has its marching orders'' to make warheads, he said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Understandably</ENAMEX>, these could be conflicting views to the company.''
Late last week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> and the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> reached an agreement that requires a long-term strategy to be developed for waste disposal at Rocky Flats. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> said the accord doesn't sufficiently address its real concerns. While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> ``obtained for itself an agreement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> and the state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> that they would not take any administrative action against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DOE</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> could not secure the same guarantee for itself, the suit said.
The Bush administration official, who asked not to be named, said it was decided at a meeting last week among top government officials not to grant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> immunity -- partly because of the precedent it could set for contractors operating nuclear-bomb plants across the country.
