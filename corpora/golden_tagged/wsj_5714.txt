<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> plan to join in developing technology to improve cars that run on methanol, a fuel that causes less air pollution than gasoline, a Japanese government official said.
Under a four-year program starting April 1, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Industrial Science and Technology Agency</ENAMEX> will cooperate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Environmental Protection Ageny</ENAMEX> in improving the performance of methanol cars already being tested, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsuo Aikawa</ENAMEX> of the Japanese agency.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aikawa</ENAMEX> said the problem is to make methanol-powered cars start in cold weather or thin air.
An unspecified number of researchers from Japanese companies will work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> to develop a methanol car that will start in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aikawa</ENAMEX> said. He said such cars currently have trouble starting at temperatures below five degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> plans to spend about 800 million yen ($5.5 million) for the four-year program, according to a major Japanese economic newspaper.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has called on auto makers to help cut air pollution by producing 500,000 methanol-powered cars in 1995 and one million such cars each year from 1997 through 2004.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methanol</ENAMEX> is made from coal or natural gas and emits less carbon monoxide than gasoline. Gasoline also emits nitrous oxides that contribute to smog.
