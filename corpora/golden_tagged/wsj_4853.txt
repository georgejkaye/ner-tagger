The stock price of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>' parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> tumbled $7.125 a share to $274 amid concerns that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> may force a change in the pending $6.79 billion labor-management buy-out of the airline.
The drop, following a $5.125 decline Friday, reflected stock traders' fears that a $750 million investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> takeover by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> may have to be reduced in a way that could delay the purchase or lower the $300-a-share price of the buy-out.
The fears increased following a report in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> has asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Checchi</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investor, to have KLM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Dutch Airways</ENAMEX>' $400 million investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> reduced.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> and his staff have voiced concerns about foreign ownership and the amount of debt involved in airline takeovers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> case is the first step the secretary has taken to back up his statements with action.
``I think the  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> deal will still get done,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helane Becker</ENAMEX>, an airline analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton    Inc.</ENAMEX> ``But it may get done at a different price.''
Foreign companies can't legally own more than 25% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines nor can they exercise control. The stake by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> and another foreign investor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders IXL Ltd.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, totals only 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>'s voting stock. But the foreign companies' $480 million investment accounted for 69% of the $700 million in equity capital raised by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> for the $3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> isn't likely to contest a demand for a reduction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM</ENAMEX> investment, according to people familiar with the situation, as long as he has enough time to replace the funds with those from other investors. His purchase was completed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> officials said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> will announce the outcome of a review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> buy-out soon, perhaps as early as tomorrow or Thursday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> officials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> representatives have apparently been negotiating the specifics of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM</ENAMEX> investment reduction during the past few days.
The situation is somewhat more precarious at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>. That takeover hasn't closed yet, and the purchaser is a fragile coalition of two longtime enemies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> management and the pilots' union, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX>. Any delay could prove its undoing.
In a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> board Sept. 14 urging prompt approval of the buy-out, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Wolf</ENAMEX> warned that its ``chances of success easily could be hurt if momentum is lost.'' He called the labor harmony needed for the bid ``inherently fragile.''
Yesterday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> made a formal request of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> for information about the takeover, focusing on the financial structure and the degree of foreign ownership. It set a deadline of Oct. 10 for a reply. The pilot-management bid is scheduled to close in late October.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> is receiving only a 15% voting interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>, the $750 million amount of its investment is 78% of $965 million in cash equity raised for the purchase. The buyers plan to obtain bank loans for the remainder of the price.
The buyers, led by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> pilots' union, could argue that $200 million in annual cost concessions being made by the pilots represents equity worth $1 billion. If that were counted along with a $200 million equity stake from the pilots' pension fund, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> stake would represent a smaller percentage.
If the department seeks a reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>'s stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>, the investment can be readily reduced. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> already plans to resell $300 million in preferred stock with an 18% dividend. And it can convert that stock, as well as a $200 million preferred paying a 13% dividend, into debt.
However, converting either of those two securities into debt would only further raise the debt leverage of the buy-out, possibly heightening Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX>'s other concern about riskier airline capital structures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> request for information, as did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> and the pilots' union. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> has an analysts' meeting scheduled for today to promote a stock offering that will help finance its investment.
In an interview earlier this week, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> said he expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to allow the transaction, partly because he believed the 85% employee ownership stake would count in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>'s favor. He also defended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>'s 15% investment, noting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> airline will receive only one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> board seat. ``I can't imagine how anyone can think one board seat can offset 14 others,'' he said.
It was unclear how much Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX>'s concern reflects a disapproval of airline buy-outs and how much is tied to negotiations with European governments over the allocation of routes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey N. Shane</ENAMEX>, deputy transportation secretary for policy and international affairs, said in an interview last month that the department is reluctant to allow substantial foreign ownership stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines while the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is still in talks over how the unification of European markets will affect the airline industry.
European carriers are widely expected to seek the right to fly between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> cities. Some U.S. officials fear the Europeans might use their ownership stakes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers to press that issue. At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers are seeking to expand their rights to European routes.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, interest is building on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> in leveraged buy-outs of airlines and foreign ownership. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Aviation</ENAMEX> subcommittee has scheduled hearings on the topics next Tuesday and Wednesday, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Aviation</ENAMEX> subcommittee will hold a hearing on foreign ownership on Tuesday.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> may conduct reviews on whether an airline is fit to operate safely, and may revoke its operating certificate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> leaders have introduced legislation giving the department authority over airline buy-outs as well, and may extend that effort to deal with the foreign-ownership issue.
Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> wins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> clearance, the buy-out faces thorny internal problems. An official close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Association of Machinists</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s largest union, said the union has decided against participating. The official said the union probably won't announce its decision until tomorrow or Thursday.
He added that the machinists plan to lobby transportation officials, members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>'s lenders in an effort to scuttle the buy-out. The official said the union is more interested in negotiating ``substantial new wage increases'' than in owning a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United.</ENAMEX>
