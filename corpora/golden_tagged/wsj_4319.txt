One morning this spring, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Quayle</ENAMEX> dropped in at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Studios</ENAMEX> here and asked to appear on Arsenio <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s new late-night talk show.
The 30-year-old host readily agreed. Wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses for their outdoor meeting, he talked Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> through her feelings about the worst things said of her spouse, Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX>. Then, with schoolboy charm, he melted her reserve with a husky-voiced paean to her eyes.
Looking back on that impromptu interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> calls it the kind of triumph white industry executives thought he couldn't pull off. ``Do you know why she did the show?'' he asks, sitting in his office on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> lot. ``Her children told her to do the show. Her children '' He plants his unlaced tennis shoes on the rug and sails back in his chair in exhilaration. ``That's when I said,'God, thank you -- I'm getting through.'''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> is indeed getting through -- to millions of young viewers each night. In the process, he is shattering the notions of TV executives, a predominantly white male fraternity he refers to as ``the suits,'' about what can succeed in their medium.
``Here you have a black man calling all the shots,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton Cloud</ENAMEX>, a black independent television producer who has worked with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>. ``Why is the show so hip? <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arsenio</ENAMEX> is booking all the talent. What's amazing is that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> still doesn't get it.''
Home audiences apparently are, however. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> is reaching more viewers in the coveted under-35 age group than any of his competitors -- an average of 2.9 million a night during July, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.C. Nielsen Co.</ENAMEX>, the TV rating service. By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Carson</ENAMEX>'s ``Tonight Show'' was watched by 2.4 million people in this age group in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. And while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carson</ENAMEX> is still the king of late-night talk, with a 5.4 overall rating for that month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s mark of 4.1 put him well ahead of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Letterman</ENAMEX>, who garnered a 3.1, and newcomer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Sajak</ENAMEX>, who earned only 2.8 despite his popularity earned as host of ``Wheel of Fortune.'' (Each rating point represents about 904,000 households.)
Most nights, ``The Arsenio <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> Show,'' which made its debut in January and is now syndicated to some 172 local stations across the country, amounts to an unpredictable house party. Celebrities are welcome to show up uninvited, and many of them are somewhat less familiar to white people over 40 than Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> might jump up and dance with a rap musician's dancers or sit on the floor to interview a child actress. Once, he brought on a court reporter, just to see if she could really get everything down.
The party has a few ground rules. After his monologue, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> exhorts the studio audience to ``get busy,'' which translates as a call for passionate involvement. The crowd barks ``roof'' to signal its enthusiasm. And guests must ``give it up'' -- that is, shed pretense and inhibition.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> has never come to a party at a black man's house,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>, adding that he has a larger mission. ``I'm more than a comedian. I bring stuff from the ghetto to the suburbs and stuff from the suburbs to the ghetto. I'm an American, and I'm going to do everything every other talk show host has done -- and one thing more. I'm going to bring everybody together on the same couch.''
Perhaps not surprisingly, such pronouncements have laid Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> open to charges of arrogance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Shales</ENAMEX>, a critic for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX>, says he resents the implication that television needs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> to save it from ``square'' whites. ``I think it's a little messianic,'' he says. ``I wish he could scale it down a bit and just try and do a good show.''
Another criticism, leveled in various media by such people as the black film maker Spike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, is that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> hasn't been ambitious enough in exercising his newfound clout to get more jobs for blacks, who remain under-represented in the industry. A heated exchange on this point between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willis Edwards</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> branch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Association</ENAMEX> for the Advancement of Colored People, resulted in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwards</ENAMEX>'s filing a $10 million libel lawsuit against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> counters that he employs significantly more blacks than any similar show and even has a small minority-internship program. As for the rest, he insists that he is looking only for ratings, not power. Thinking in terms of power is ``the beginning of the end'' of being himself, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> says.
Recently, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> signed a second one-year contract for the show, of which he is executive producer. Although he won't disclose how much he is paid, he says his financial stake gives him a piece of ``the upside'' if the audience grows. ``I have faith that if I do good work, the money will come,'' he says.
What viewers get in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> is a spontaneous, genial and, where women guests are concerned, often flirtatious host. Working without a desk, he tends to interview visitors while hunched at the edge of his chair -- a posture that some critics contend is evidence of a generally fawning approach. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s style ``smacks of that insider <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> sycophantishness,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Kogan</ENAMEX>, a TV critic for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX>. ``It may be that it's his method of creating instant intimacy.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> does have a sharper side, though. Last season, he opened a conversation with rock star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheena Easton</ENAMEX> by asking if it was true that ``your ex-husband was a female impersonator, and now he does you.'' Though the two traded barbs, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Easton</ENAMEX> remained cool, despite having been upstaged as well by pop superstar <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitney Houston</ENAMEX>, who had made an unscheduled walk-on during the monologue.
But unannounced appearances aren't unusual. One night, the whole cast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> hit ``Cheers'' showed up to see their friend, singer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson Browne</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boxing</ENAMEX> champs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Tyson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugar Ray Leonard</ENAMEX> seem to have sublet spots on the couch, as has comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Murphy</ENAMEX>, a close friend of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>. And former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Jets defensive end <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Gastineau</ENAMEX> broke up one monologue by tackling Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> didn't set out to create a free-for-all. Early last year, while researching the possibility of launching a late-night show, the company discovered that ``the 18-to-34 market was not being serviced,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Goldman</ENAMEX>, the executive vice president in charge of distributing and marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>'s syndicated products. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> decided that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> would have the best chance of reaching this market.
``When we went to Arsenio, we looked at him as a talent and a performer who could do late-night,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucille Salhany</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>'s domestic TV division. ``Talent rises to the top -- I don't care if you're black, white or whatever.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>, the son of a Baptist preacher, grew up poor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, raised by his mother, grandmother and godmother after his parents divorced. By the age of 12, he says, he had already decided on the signature he would one day use as the logo for his talk show.
After graduating from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kent State University</ENAMEX> in 1979 with a degree in communications, he worked briefly in sales for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell Corp.</ENAMEX>, the cosmetics company. It was in 1980 that he first tried stand-up comedy on a dare, and only a short time later that singer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Wilson</ENAMEX> caught his act in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and paid for his move to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
Between 1983 and 1986, he appeared on three comedy\ shows, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX>'s ``Solid Gold'' dance program. In 1987, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> released him from his contract so that he could replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Rivers</ENAMEX> as an interim host on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX>'s sinking ``Late Show.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> developed a cult following, but by the time Fox reviewed the ratings, the show had been canceled and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> was filming ``Coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'' with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX>. It was while promoting that movie that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> decided to accept an offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> to do a show of his own.
Besides having more blacks and other minorities, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s production staff is also younger and includes more women than most television shows. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marla Kell Brown</ENAMEX>, the show's 27-year-old producer, acts as a stand-in for white <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle America</ENAMEX> as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> flies through the show. Always standing just behind the cameras, she can signal to her boss when he should slow down for those who don't know, for example, that ``def'' means great.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> confesses that when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> met her, she was like ``an unhip Girl Scout.'' But now, ``he trusts me because when I make a decision, he knows it's in his best interest,'' she says, adding, ``I'm not from that old-boy network.''
Minutes before taping this season's premiere, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> roams through Studio 29 in a sweatsuit, patting his employees' backs, greeting visitors and checking details. He stops once to hug the mother of singer and dancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paula Abdul</ENAMEX>, whose fans have been lining up since dawn for a chance to see her first performance on his show, and again to explain the etymology of ``get busy'' for a visitor. Only at the last minute does he shower and slip into one of his trademark double-breasted suits.
Downstairs awaits an almost all-white audience of about 300. Instead of his usual monologue, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> just shouts ``I'm back '' from offstage and introduces Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul</ENAMEX>. Later, while interviewing the former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles Lakers</ENAMEX> cheerleader, he tells the audience she has an evil side that he jokingly calls ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pauletta</ENAMEX>.'' When Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul</ENAMEX> fails to respond, a woman in the audience breaks the nervous silence by yelling, ``The honeymoon's over.'' (Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> denies reports of a romance with Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul</ENAMEX>, but he acknowledges that theirs is a ``special friendship.'')
After the show, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> changes quickly out of the suit and heads for his production trailer to review the show. He is focused on only one thing -- doing well for a second season. For already, another syndicated talk show has appeared with a rowdy audience and a black host, TV personality <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Allen</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> is heartened, though, by a story told to him by some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount</ENAMEX> executives: One station manager who bought Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>'s show said he expected it to do even better than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>, who created his image on the wholesome ``Real People'' show, ``wasn't as black.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> says that when the executives told him the story, ``they were laughing now at the concept of a black man having to be white'' to succeed on television.
``My white'suits ' here,'' he says, ``are a lot hipper than they were before.
