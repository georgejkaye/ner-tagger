<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, said that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grid Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> subsidiary reached an agreement on cross-licensing of patents with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX> for the manufacture, use and sale of laptop computers. Terms weren't disclosed.
In April, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grid</ENAMEX> filed suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> federal court, seeking to enforce what it considered fundamental patents for laptop computers.
The company said yesterday it is currently negotiating with several other laptop makers regarding its patents.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> agreement is a standard licensing agreement, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle Preston</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Bros.</ENAMEX> analyst, it will cover 1% to 2% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy</ENAMEX>'s sales volume. But since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grid</ENAMEX> is licensing some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> technology, she said, it's hard to assess the impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandy</ENAMEX> earnings.
