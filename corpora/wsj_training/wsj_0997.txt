Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI Television Inc.</ENAMEX> proposed to restructure much of its $1.3 billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations.
The leveraged buy-out firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX>, which owns 46% of the common equity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV, indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to 15%, giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> also signaled to the company's creditors that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kravis</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> directors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights.
Holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s $507 million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to forgive a lot of debt in exchange for taking a 39% equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV. They immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company's problems.
``I think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done,'' says analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Davis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.D. Smith & Co.</ENAMEX> here.
Investors interpreted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV. But a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> says that with only a 15% equity stake, it wouldn't be appropriate for KKR to keep board representation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> already has made about $1 billion of gains from earlier transactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV, thus it isn't significantly affected by the company's troubles.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>, which is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gillett</ENAMEX>, owns six TV stations, including several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> affiliates. It is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leveraged buy-out.
Through investment banker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX> is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> would give up a 31% equity stake to bondholders, while Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> would surrender an 8% stake. While one big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV investor thinks that's pretty generous, many junkholders had been hoping that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KKR</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> would invest new money in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV. Those investors think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> TV needs new equity to survive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI TV</ENAMEX>'s debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $153 million of bank debt. It also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due; the grace period for paying the bill expires Nov. 16.
At the same time, investors estimate the restructuring would cut the company's annual cash interest bill from about $90 million to $85 million. Yet to pay that interest bill, analysts say SCI TV will only produce about $80 million to $90 million of cash flow a year.
