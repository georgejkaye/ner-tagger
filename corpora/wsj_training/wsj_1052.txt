The bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW Services</ENAMEX>, a group of restaurant chains, became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers.
The good news -- to fans of stable credit, at least -- is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers. Apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coniston Partners</ENAMEX>, which with related entities controls 80% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX>, had been planning to sell $1.15 billion of junk bonds, among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coniston</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> partnership managed by the firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gollust</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tierney & Oliver</ENAMEX>, yesterday announced that ``in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets'' the offering would be postponed and restructured. What wasn't mentioned is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> and its investment banker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette</ENAMEX>, just completed a two-week ``road show'' for the purpose of marketing the bonds. And investors, at least for now, took a pass.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX>'s junk bonds weren't, as junk bonds go, unusually weak. Its fast-food restaurants -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denny</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hardee</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quincy</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Pollo Loco</ENAMEX> (``the only significant fast-food chain to specialize in char-broiled chicken'') -- are stable, recession-resistant and growing. But unless they continued to grow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paramus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, would have run into trouble.
Until recently, such buy-now, pray-for-growth-later deals were routine. ``But people don't buy anything on expectation anymore,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Utter</ENAMEX>, who manages the high-yield fund of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IDS Financial Services</ENAMEX>. ``Investors,'' he adds, ``are getting religion.'' The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX> buy-out may yet be financed. ``There is nothing wrong with the company,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Tierney</ENAMEX>. The rub, he says, is that ``the junk market isn't as deep'' as before. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX>'s stockholder meeting was postponed from tomorrow to Nov. 21. By then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> hopes to be able to sell less-junky junk bonds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gollust, Tierney & Oliver</ENAMEX> is likely to contribute more than the $120 million in equity it had planned on. Banks may contribute more senior debt. And the total amount of junk financing will be reduced.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> banker, putting a best possible face on it, asserts that ``very few people said they didn't like the credit quality. People said they didn't think a billion-dollar deal would trade.''
But trading risk stems from credit risk. And by adding equity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern. Indeed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> banker says, in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest ``will meaningfully improve.'' As he sums it up: ``We are listening to the market.''
What is it, to borrow a term from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coniston</ENAMEX>, that so unsettled the market? Some of the same risks that were cited -- and seemingly ignored -- in dozens of previous junk offerings.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX> prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier, pretax earnings ``would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges, including interest on debt securities,'' by approximately $62.7 million in the first six months of 1989. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX> notes, as many junk issuers do, that ``adjusted to eliminate non-cash charges'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX> would have run a cash surplus -- in this case, of $56 million over six months.
But such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation, taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers, deterioration of stores and the like. In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> says, the company envisions capital expenses of about $180 million a year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX>'s pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people won't stop eating during a downturn. But they won't necessarily eat at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denny</ENAMEX>'s. The fast-food business is ``intensely competitive,'' notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wertheim Schroder</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rohs</ENAMEX>. Prospective bond buyers noted that TW historically has prospered because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and redoing menus.
``We were concerned that they weren't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt,'' says a big investor in high-yield debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DLJ</ENAMEX> argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX> could, if necessary, cut capital spending, since half of what it plans to spend is for ``growth,'' rather than maintenance. But investors noted that under the shelved offering, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TW</ENAMEX> would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments. Its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $52 million a year in interest on cash-deferred, or zero-coupon debentures -- which ultimately would have had to be paid.
The prospectus notes ``there can be no assurance'' that future growth will continue at past levels. In the recent past, bond buyers didn't seek such assurance. Now, apparently, they do.
