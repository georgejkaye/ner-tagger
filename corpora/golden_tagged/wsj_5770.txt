``After death human thought lives on by momentum,'' wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Nabokov</ENAMEX> in an early novel. He certainly was correct about his own: A dozen years after his death at 78, new paperback editions of his works proliferate, and we are offered his 10th posthumous volume, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vladimir Nabokov</ENAMEX>: Selected Letters, 1940-1977'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich/Bruccoli Clark Layman</ENAMEX>, 582 pages, $29.95), edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dmitri Nabokov</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew J. Bruccoli</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nabokov</ENAMEX>'s career the numbers count. This new volume supplies more than 400 letters to put beside the eight novels written in English; the 10 in Russian; the four volumes of stories; the four books of translations of Russian literature; the two volumes of plays; the one of poems and chess problems; the autobiography; the ``strong opinions'' (a collection of ``public prose'': interviews, letters to editors and articles); the correspondence with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Wilson</ENAMEX>; and the five critical books on works of English, French, German, Spanish and Russian literature. The author of ``Lolita,'' ``Pale Fire'' and ``Speak, Memory'' seems well positioned for a classic run.
Not that the man who so ostentatiously exulted in his literary prestidigitation and who so gleefully declared his hatred of Freud (``the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Viennese Quack</ENAMEX>''), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry James</ENAMEX> (``that pale porpoise'') -- as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dostoevski</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Faulkner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eliot</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mann</ENAMEX> (the last two simply were ``big fakes'') -- will ever congeal into a safe classic. He was much too eager to create ``something very weird and dynamic,'' ``catastrophic and jolly'' like ``this great and coily thing'' ``Lolita.''
But in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nabokov</ENAMEX>'s work nothing is simply as it seems. Beauty and pity, the grotesque and the heartbreaking, freedom and tyranny, the aesthetic and the moral, time lost and time regained -- these themes run throughout his books despite disclaimers that he cared not a whit for the social, political or moral aspects of literature. His notorious high Mandarin disdain was his protective coloration against political or moralistic predators.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nabokov</ENAMEX> knew more than most about the bite of history, politics and moralism, about noble causes and the sense of loss. By the time he arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> in 1940 with his wife, his six-year-old son and the manuscript of his first English novel, he already had been thrice exiled -- in 1922 from the Russia of his childhood and adolescence; in 1937 from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> where he had become a distinguished Russian novelist; and in May 1940 from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> where he had hoped to continue his literary career safe from the Nazis. His father -- a liberal democrat jailed by the czar and booted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolsheviks</ENAMEX> -- had been assassinated by Russian monarchists in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> in 1922, and a brother died in a German concentration camp some 20 years later.
No wonder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nabokov</ENAMEX> thought of art -- perfected memory -- as the one sure defense against time. But at his best he avoided aesthetic megalomania. In his masterpiece, ``Lolita,'' he portrayed the evolution of lust into love and condemned the cruel perversion that -- trying to stop time in its tracks -- created pornography and death. Despite his later evasions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nabokov</ENAMEX> was ``Conradically conservative'' (to steal his pun) and did believe in the moral importance of art: ``I never meant to deny the moral impact of art which is certainly inherent in every genuine work of art,'' he wrote a correspondent in 1945. ``What I do deny and am prepared to fight to the last drop of my ink is the deliberate moralizing which to me kills every vestige of art in a work however skillfully written.... In my opinion, the fact that {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tolstoy</ENAMEX>'s}'The Kreutzer Sonata' and'The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Darkness</ENAMEX>' were written with a deliberate moral purpose largely defeats their purpose, killing the inherent morality of uninhibited art.''
These letters bring us a master's voice notably more human and humane than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nabokov</ENAMEX>'s late public manner might suggest. In them we see a little more of the man than the mask -- not that he ever permits himself to appear in verbal or social deshabille. But in these letters his gift for friendship and his love for his family are as notable as his noble, if aristocratic dedication to the vocation of literature.
While scrambling for a teaching job and trying to gain a foothold in the American literary world, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nabokov</ENAMEX> worked as a part-time research fellow in lepidoptery in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>. Within five years of his arrival he was teaching at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellesley</ENAMEX> and had published three books, as well as stories, poems and reviews in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Republic</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>, to all of which the admirable, admiring and competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmund Wilson</ENAMEX> had most generously provided access. In 1948 he became a professor of Russian and European literature at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell</ENAMEX> for $5,500 a year. By 1959, the once-scandalous, unpublishable ``Lolita'' had triumphed on ``the golden trapeze of the best-seller list'' and freed its author from all extra-literary drudgery. He moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>, supervised translations of his Russian works, produced an annotated English version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pushkin</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Onegin</ENAMEX>,'' and continued to create new works in English until his death in
In all, these letters provide a laudable and attractive self-portrait that enlarges and -- in every sense -- domesticates our understanding of this great Russo-American writer who once so characteristically declared, ``the difference between the comic side of things and their cosmic side depends upon one sibilant.''
