The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> proposed levying anti-dumping duties against two Japanese-owned plants making dot matrix computer printers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> said it proposed duties of 30 European Currency Units (US$31.59) on matrix printers made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC Technologies Ltd.</ENAMEX> and 14 Ecus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star Micronics Manufacturing Ltd.</ENAMEX> printers for failing to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> requirement that at least 40% of components come from outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> also cleared seven other plants under investigation.
EC trade law requires companies that set up manufacturing within the Community to get at least 40% of their materials from outside their home countries in order to avoid anti-dumping duties.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC Commission</ENAMEX> said its investigation showed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC</ENAMEX> plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, was importing 68% of its materials from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Star</ENAMEX> plant was importing 98%. The investigation was initiated after a complaint by European matrix printer manufacturers last November.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC</ENAMEX> claims that less than 35% of the materials for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Telford</ENAMEX>-made printers are Japanese. More than 50% of the printers' materials come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, it says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC Technologies</ENAMEX> ``fails to understand why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> has proposed... a duty'' when it is aware of its increased use of non-Japanese domponents, the company said in a statement.
Star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Micronics</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brother Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX>, Citizen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OKI Electric Industry Co.</ENAMEX>, all in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu Espana SA</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seikosha</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>) G.m.b. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEK Elektronik G.m.b. H.</ENAMEX>, both in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, were all found to be using less than 60% Japanese-made materials.
