<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingersoll Publications Co.</ENAMEX> agreed to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Haven</ENAMEX> Register in a transaction valued at $275 million from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodson Newspaper Group Inc.</ENAMEX>
As part of the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodson</ENAMEX> also terminated the contract under which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> manages <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodson</ENAMEX>'s 66 newspapers, ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodson</ENAMEX> has accused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Sun</ENAMEX>.
Under the terms of the accord, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> will pay about $255 million for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Register</ENAMEX>, a daily that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodson</ENAMEX> bought for about $170 million in 1986. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> will pay the additional $20 million in settlement of the management contract. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodson</ENAMEX> also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> papers. Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ingersoll Jr</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodson</ENAMEX>, which is based here, will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morristown Daily Record</ENAMEX> for $155 million in 1987. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> paper, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Haven</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, paper, was purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingersoll on Goodson</ENAMEX>'s behalf as part of the management contract. Industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high, causing a strain on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodson</ENAMEX>'s finances. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX> bankers familiar with the company said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> is seeking a new bank credit line of $190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David N. Hurwitz</ENAMEX>, president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodson</ENAMEX>, said in a telephone interview that the company doesn't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Carr</ENAMEX>, former president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingersoll Publications</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Cockburn</ENAMEX>, former senior vice president, would head the new in-house management team at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodson</ENAMEX>, which had revenue of $225 million in 1988.
The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Goodson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ingersoll</ENAMEX>. The latter's son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ingersoll Jr.</ENAMEX>, took over the company and has been managing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodson</ENAMEX>. But in recent years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warburg, Pincus & Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The company said its revenue will exceed $750 million this year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Jelenic</ENAMEX> said in a statement that the company is ``delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship'' and will be able to ``concentrate all our energies'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ingersoll</ENAMEX>'s own papers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodson</ENAMEX>, in his own statement, was less upbeat, saying ``unfortunately over the past few years, it has become increasingly clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph</ENAMEX> and I have different agendas,'' and that he feels ``more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodson</ENAMEX> papers.
