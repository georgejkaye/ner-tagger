The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants: the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills. And defense lawyers are warning that they won't stick around if they don't get paid.
The issue has come to a boil in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Antar</ENAMEX> that if the founder and former chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crazy Eddie Inc.</ENAMEX> is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> is using to pay legal fees.
The warning by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney's office follows two decisions by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> last June. In those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment.
If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX>'s assets, he could be left without top-flight legal representation, because his attorneys are likely to quit, according to individuals familiar with the case. A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs.
``The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because there won't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Lefcourt</ENAMEX>, a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> is being investigated by a federal grand jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>, where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racketeer Influenced</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrupt Organizations</ENAMEX> law, or RICO, the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial.
According to individuals familiar with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX>'s case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX>'s attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure. In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX>'s lawyers that because of the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> may be seized. Prosecutors have told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX>'s attorneys that they believe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX>'s allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities. Therefore, they said, the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justin Feldman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Arseneault</ENAMEX>, attorneys for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX>, both declined to comment on the matter.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel A. Alito</ENAMEX> said, ``I don't think there's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alito</ENAMEX> said his office ``just responded to an attorney's question about whether we would go after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>. In that suit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> accused Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> of engaging in a ``massive financial fraud'' to overstate the earnings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crazy Eddie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, over a three-year period. Through his lawyers, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> has denied allegations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> and others.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> has alleged that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX> aimed to pump up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> said, made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> has emphasized that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly. According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made.
Still, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers' fees. They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid.
