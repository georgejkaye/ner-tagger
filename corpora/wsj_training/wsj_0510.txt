<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doskocil Cos.</ENAMEX> said its bank-debt payments have been extended until May 31, 1990, to give it more time to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson Foods Corp.</ENAMEX> retail and fresh meat operations.
The company was to repay $58 million in debt on Dec. 31 and $15 million on March 31. The company acquired the debt when it paid $155 million to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> last year.
An agreement to sell the Wilson assets for $150 million in cash and notes collapsed in late September, when the buyer, a company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gillett</ENAMEX>, couldn't secure financing.
