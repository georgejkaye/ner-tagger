A big drop in new stock offerings, traditionally a major source of revenue for securities firms, helped depress <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>'s fees from underwriting stocks and bonds in the first nine months of the year.
New issues of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, the only other highly profitable underwriting business, remained active in the third quarter. But last month's precipitous decline in junk bond prices could offset some of the profitability from selling new issues, industry officials say. As a result, unsold inventories of new issues could swell.
During the first three quarters, disclosed fees from securities underwriting plummeted to $2.1 billion from $2.9 billion in the first nine months of 1988, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Data Co.</ENAMEX> Once again, the biggest losers were underwriters of common stock offerings, which declined 37% to $15 billion. Initial public stock offerings tumbled 49% to $9.8 billion. All told, fees from underwriting equity in the first nine months fell to $868.3 million from $1.5 billion at this point last year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>, which underwrote more securities issues in the first three quarters than its closest two competitors combined, was the leader in fee income. The firm earned $ 332.2 million from underwriting 182 offerings.
No. 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> earned $313.8 million from 49 offerings, largely on the back of its perennial dominance of the junk bond market. During the first nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> arranged 38 junk bond offerings, more than its four closest competitors combined.
The relatively small difference in fee income between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> is another indication of the erosion in profits in underwriting investment-grade securities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>, which was the leading domestic and global underwriter in the first three quarters because of its growing share of investment-grade debt offerings, posted only slightly higher fee income than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> arranged more than three times as many securities offerings as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> and more than twice the dollar amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>-managed issues.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> received their biggest boosts from underwriting a $4 billion junk bond offering that helped finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX>'s $25 billion takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> Underwriting fees for that transaction totaled well over $100 million, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> receiving the lion's share.
In the junk bond new issue market, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s earnings dwarfed those of its rivals. The firm received $299.6 million in fees. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX> received $74.3 million, $66.8 million, $47.5 million, $33.8 million and $29.1 million, respectively.
In the market for new stock offerings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> was the top earner of fees, with $135.5 million from 20 offerings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill</ENAMEX> earned $111.7 million from 29 offerings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alex.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown & Sons</ENAMEX> received $86.8 million from 26 offerings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities</ENAMEX> earned $81.5 million from 12 offerings, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc.</ENAMEX> earned $72.2 million from 18 offerings.
