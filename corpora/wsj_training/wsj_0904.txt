<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> said that its net income rose 51% in the third quarter, bolstered by unusual gains from its investment in a disk-drive maker and reflecting continued growth in its European operations.
The computer maker said net jumped to $87 million, or $2.02 a share, from $58 million, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 36% to $683 million from $502 million. The latest quarter's results, however, included a pretax gain of $13.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the carrying value of the company's investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner Peripherals Inc.</ENAMEX> and a $7.6 million gain, or 11 cents a share, from the sale of one million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conner</ENAMEX> shares.
Net for the nine months was $254 million, or $5.94 a share, up 56% from $163 million, or $4.06 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 50% to $2.1 billion from $1.4 billion. Net for the year-earlier nine months also included a gain of $9.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the carrying value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conner</ENAMEX> investment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Swavely</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> division, attributed the company's third-quarter performance to continued increases in international sales, which accounted for 43% of the company's sales, a 74% increase from a year earlier.
``Over the next couple of years we would not be surprised to see <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and international {sales} represent 50% of the company's revenues,'' he said.
During the third quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> purchased a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang Laboratories</ENAMEX> manufacturing facility in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stirling</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, which will be used for international service and repair operations. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swavely</ENAMEX> said the new space will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> to increase the manufacturing capacity of its plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Erskine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>.
