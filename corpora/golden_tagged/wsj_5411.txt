<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics Institute</ENAMEX> said it received two U.S. patents, including one covering materials used to make the hormone M-CSF by recombinant DNA technology and another that claims a class of variants of the blood-clotting protein, Factor VIII.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M-CSF</ENAMEX> patent covers DNA sequences and engineered cells. Another U.S. patent covering the manufacturing process itself is expected ``shortly,'' the company said. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, biotechnology concern said it currently is testing M-CSF in clinical trials in cancer patients and in bone marrow transplant recipients.
The Factor VIII patent also covers recombinant DNA methods for manufacture of the variants. ``If proven safe and effective,'' the modified proteins ``could offer a less expensive product for hemophilia treatment,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics Institute</ENAMEX> said.
