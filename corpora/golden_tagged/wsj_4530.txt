In a sign that the first stage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> merger is complete, the company said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael A. Miles</ENAMEX>, president and chief operating officer, will become chief executive and chairman.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX>, widely respected as a marketing whiz, takes over from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Richman</ENAMEX>, who originally was expected to leave at year end. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richman</ENAMEX>, age 61, will join the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wachtell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lipton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosen & Katz.</ENAMEX>
The executive change comes on the eve of the first anniversary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX>' $12.9 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX> and the merging of Kraft with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX> to form the world's second-largest food company. The basic organizational structure of seven operating companies and the team of top managers -- drawn heavily from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kraft</ENAMEX>'s ranks -- of the $24 billion food behemoth are now in place. The first round of post-merger house cleaning has been completed, too. But the toughest part of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX>'s assignment still looms and many uncertainties remain.
This year, Kraft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX> expects to realize productivity savings of more than $400 million from the combination of the two food companies. Some of the most visible initiatives have included melding management and sales forces in the two companies' international operations, closing three plants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and laying off about 2,000 workers, or about 2% of the 98,000-employee force. Cost savings have also come from 3,000 separate programs. For example, reducing the size of the caps on mayonnaise and Miracle Whip jars will save $6 million annually. Putting Velveeta shells and cheese dinners in pouches instead of cans will leave another $3.5 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kraft</ENAMEX>'s coffers.
In addition, the company this year will realize $50 million from some preliminary synergies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX>'s operating companies are jointly purchasing raw materials from crops to cardboard for a savings of $8 million. The U.S. units are also consolidating media buys and promotions. Last month, for instance, as part of its Great American Breakfast campaign, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX> began jointly promoting its treasure trove of brands: Post cereal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lender</ENAMEX>'s bagels, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Mayer</ENAMEX> bacon and sausage and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> cream cheese.
As a result of such efforts, Kraft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX> is expected to meet its ambitious growth targets this year. The company expects operating profit to grow almost 30% to more than $2 billion in 1989.
But 50-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> and his managment team still face daunting challenges. ``Bigness can be an advantage in the sense that you can utilize economies of scale and achieve volume discounts, but bigness sometimes brings with it bureaucracy and red tape,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> concedes. ``We have to make sure this $24 billion thing doesn't start behaving like a dinosaur but continues to be an action oriented and creative entity.''
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glenview</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, headquarters is nowadays the site of much soul-searching, particularly over the issue of synergy. At the behest of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX>, several management consultants have been brought in to proffer advice about whether and at what pace the blending of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX> should proceed.
Still unresolved are such critical issues as whether the five operating companies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> should integrate their sales forces, their refrigerated and dry grocery distribution systems, their product lines and their managements. In one of the few such moves to date, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX> recently moved the management of Birds Eye frozen products to the All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Gourmet</ENAMEX> headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
``They basically have taken all the easy synergies, but the harder work is yet to be done,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Burry</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burry</ENAMEX> estimates that the so-called -- easy synergies have offset about one-third of the acquisition's $1.50-to-$2-a-share dilution to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> earning. But he contends the ``jury is still out on whether there are enough remaining synergies to offset the remaining dilution.''
``The issues now are the ones that could fundamentally change the structure of doing business, as opposed to doing what they do now more efficiently,'' says one source close to the company. He adds: ``They will pull it off, but will go through some real bumps and grinds because of the complexity.''
At the same time, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> and his team also are grappling with more fundamental business issues. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX>'s unit volumes will be up about 1% this year, compared with gains of 3% to 5% for the food industry's best performers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> says he is ``not happy'' about the profitability of the company's huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell House</ENAMEX> coffee business, despite its recent share gains. Post cereals is experiencing serious erosion of market share while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX>'s core margarine and salad dressings businesses are under pressure too.
``There is an honest appraisal within the company that we are the biggest food company in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, but nowhere near the best,'' says one company insider. ``The vast majority of our volume comes from food brands that peaked a while ago and the question is how do we get a product portfolio that takes us into the'90s, into a growth mode.''
To better align its huge array of products with today's consumer tastes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX> is now making a concerted effort to become a leader in the low-fat to no-fat foods arena.
Earlier this spring, the company launched cholesterol-free mayonnaise and Miracle Whip. Last week, it introduced Sealtest Free, which it bills as the first national brand of ``nonfat'' ice cream and began testing a line of fat-free salad dressings. In the offing: An array of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entenmann</ENAMEX>'s fat-free and cholesterol-free baked goods, which owe their existence to fat replacement research pioneered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft.</ENAMEX> (Until the merger, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entenmann</ENAMEX>'s was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX>' brand.)
But despite these strides, some analysts believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX> will have to unleash many more new products to make good on its bid to be biggest and best. ``Now that the consolidation is complete, the challenge is to restore growth by weeding the garden and planting new trees. They need to crank up their technical research and light a fire under their marketing force because their stream of new products is too slow,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Goldman</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities.</ENAMEX>
One area that has proved less fractious than anticipated is the merging of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX>' corporate cultures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX> managers tend to be faster moving and more focused on cost cutting and productivity than was case at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Tucker</ENAMEX>, senior vice president of human resources at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX>, says, ``If there is a difference it's not in the culture {of the two companies} as much as the style.''
Even so, the Kraft way of doing things prevails. ``What it really is at this point is more an acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX> by Kraft than a merger,'' quips <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Tappan</ENAMEX>, a former group vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX>. ``Kraft management has emerged as the dominant force and the real reason for that is that none of the senior management of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX> are left.''
For the moment, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> seems well satisfied with its huge food merger and is displaying its characteristic hands-off attitude. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles</ENAMEX> says he detects little change at Kraft in the aftermath of the merger. ``Basically the names have changed, but the mission remains the same,'' he says.
For its part, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX>, the world's largest consumer goods company, does seem to be making a concerted effort to downplay the Marlboro Man as it seeks to broaden the perception that people have of the company.
For example, an employee in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX>' aviation department recently ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGF</ENAMEX> to withdraw from participation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Angel Network</ENAMEX>, which arranges free flights to treatment centers for cancer patients aboard corporate jets. Now a company spokesman terms the incident a ``dumb mistake,'' stressing that the employee actions didn't reflect the wishes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX>' Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamish Maxwell</ENAMEX>. Last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> offered to provide 12 of its planes to help the non-profit organization.
