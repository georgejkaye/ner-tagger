An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Corporation Commission</ENAMEX> hearing officer issued a scathing recommendation in which he suggested that the commission cut <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucson Electric Power Co.</ENAMEX>'s request for a rate increase to $57 million from $80.3 million and that the company's request for a 9% fuel surcharge be denied.
The commission can accept, deny or amend the recommendations.
Assistant Chief Hearing Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Rudibaugh</ENAMEX> also recommended that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucson Electric</ENAMEX> management audit be conducted, saying that ``one theme prevalent throughout the recent history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEP</ENAMEX> has been its emphasis on shareholder\ compensation, and disregard for its customers and this regulatory commission.'' He added that the utility ``stretched the regulatory limits as far as possible. As a result, the company was reluctant to come before the commission for a rate increase until financially it could no longer afford to wait.''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucson Electric</ENAMEX> spokesman noted that the company has 10 days to respond to the commission, and wouldn't comment further.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Tirello</ENAMEX>, a utility analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX>, said that despite the critical language, the officer's recommendation is ``not all that bad. On a relative basis it could have been worse.'' He noted that although the utility had requested a 22% rate boost, it was bracing itself for only a 9% to 10% increase. The officer's recommendation would amount to nearly a 12% increase.
Under the recommendation, the average residential electric bill would increase $5.35 a month.
