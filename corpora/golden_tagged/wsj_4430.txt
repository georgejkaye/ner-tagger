Although your Sept. 11 page-one article about ballparks didn't bring any wistful memories about all the decaying ballparks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> that I've yet to have an opportunity to visit, I did notice an error of omission.
You mention that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wrigley Field</ENAMEX> is the only park in the majors where the scoreboard is operated entirely by hand and that in Beantown you also get the personal touch on the scoreboard, except that some lights are operated from the press box. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsk</ENAMEX>, tsk. Let me just say for the record that in the semi-sterile, somewhat generic, multipurpose but cozy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland Coliseum</ENAMEX>, home of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> A's, the scoreboard over right field is hand-operated. I've actually seen, with my binoculars, the mysterious hands. Look for the hands in the coming Fall Classic.
