A surprise proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> that would revamp <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s production quotas stalled formal sessions and sent oil ministers back into private huddles on the plan's viability.
The meeting is scheduled to resume this afternoon.
The Iranian proposal brings centerstage a potentially wrenching issue that many thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Petroleum Exporting</ENAMEX> Countries would sidestep at this session -- the redistribution of production rights among its 13 member nations.
Some OPEC countries have been clamoring for what amounts to a reduction in the relative output shares of nations already pumping near capacity, and reallocating that to those with large, unused potential. But as this meeting approached, it seemed ministers had little appetite for that job. It was believed they'd probably only set a new fourth-quarter production ceiling to recognize rising demand and parcel out any boost on a pro-rata basis.
Late yesterday, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> unveiled its new quota proposal, after an acrimonious morning session failed to resolve the production-ceiling debate. The Iranian proposal has support from some large producers and could win favor from a few others because it takes into account some of the widely varying differences in the production capacities of the exporters.
But adoption is far from assured. Among other things, it effectively means any opportunity for increased output for five members will depend on the marketplace.
Oil markets oscillated on the day's reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>, with crude futures ending mostly higher on optimism that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> will reach agreement. On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX> Intermediate for November delivery ended at $19.53 a barrel, up seven cents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iran</ENAMEX> proposed an increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s official ceiling -- to 21.5 million barrels a day for the fourth quarter, slightly above <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>'s morning proposal of 21 million barrels a day. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s current official ceiling is 19.5 million barrels daily, but because of quota cheating, actual production is running around 22 million.
Unlike the Saudi proposal, however, the Iranian plan calls for doling out the added production rights only partly on a pro-rata basis. It would maintain the percentage shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s three largest producers -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>'s 24.5% and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>'s quotas of 14.7% each.
It would offer special allocations of 1,350,000 barrels a day to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX>, chronic overproducers that have been agitating for larger shares. Each has a current quota of slightly more than one million barrels.
Three other countries -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ecuador</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gabon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qatar</ENAMEX> -- would also be due special treatment under the Iranian proposal.
The remaining five countries -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venezuela</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algeria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nigeria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX> -- wouldn't get the increased allotments of the others, and primarily would have to rely on higher market prices for most of their economic gains. However, they don't currently have huge unused production capacity, and price has been increasingly important to them anyway.
Thus, proponents of the Iranian plan argued it could improve the positions of these countries by reducing rampant quota cheating, which would in turn firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s oil prices.
``Demand {for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s oil} is very high,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gholamreza Aghazadeh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>'s oil minister, in an interview. ``Now is the best time to solve the {quota} problems inside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>. If we can solve the problems inside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>, the price will go up. If we can't, the price will go down.''
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> delegates agreed the five countries could benefit from higher oil prices. ``But if the market doesn't respond positively, these countries could lose both politically and economically,'' conceded one delegate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libya</ENAMEX>'s oil minister didn't seem to be impressed. Asked by reporters if the proposal was acceptable, the official, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fawzi A. Shakshuki</ENAMEX>, replied: ``The way it is submitted: No''. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakshuki</ENAMEX> has been calling for production parity with Kuwait even though some say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Libya</ENAMEX> doesn't have that much output capacity.
The Iranian plan appeared to win support from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> heavyweights with considerable capacity whose percentage shares of output would be left intact. Also attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s biggest producer, is that it might curb cheating, something the kingdom has traditionally opposed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plus</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi</ENAMEX> delegation has been aggressive here in promoting a 21.5-million-barrel ceiling, the same as proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>. It only proposed a slightly lower ceiling yesterday morning in hopes of winning a compromise. The strong role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> here has come despite the absence of their influential oil minister, Hisham <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nazer</ENAMEX>, who is recuperating from major surgery. It is understood that the minister is in constant telephone communication with the delegation.
