Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX> is considering imposing a tax on the short-term trades of securities by currently tax-free pension funds.
In an interview, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> Democrat said he was considering the new levy ``among other options'' as part of his drive to raise enough taxes to meet deficit-reduction goals this year. He added that he hasn't made any decision about the pension option.
The notion stems from Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX>'s interest in encouraging long-range thinking by American business interests and in discouraging short-term trading for quick profits.
``I'm deeply concerned about the churning of stocks and short-term horizons,'' he said. ``That's been particularly true of the pension managers and some of the tax-free funds.''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> and his committee soon will begin drafting legislation designed to raise some $5.3 billion in taxes to reduce the budget deficit. A package of proposals meeting a similar obligation is pending in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, and is scheduled to be voted on as early as next week.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> version of the revenue-raising plan, passed last week by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX>, doesn't include a similar tax on pension-fund trades.
A proposal to tax pension-fund trading would cause tremors on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>, where such a levy would cut broker commissions by reducing trading. The tax would also be a clear violation of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s ``no tax'' pledge.
But the idea would be a shrewd political response by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> to efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> to devise measures to discourage short-term thinking by U.S. businesses. A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> official said the department hasn't considered any proposals to tax pension funds, and noted that that would clearly violate the president's tax stance. But some administration officials are sympathetic to the idea.
Taxing pension funds also has bipartisan support on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>. Republican Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Kassebaum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> wrote a column in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> Aug. 30 proposing a 20% capital-gains tax on pension investments held for less than three months. Under Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kassebaum</ENAMEX>'s proposal, the tax would be reduced each quarter and phased out for assets held more than a year.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kassebaum</ENAMEX> said she sent a copy of the column to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bentsen</ENAMEX> last week and received a note from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Committee</ENAMEX> chairman saying he'd like to discuss the idea with her. Staff aides to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kassebaum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Minority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>) also met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> officials last week to promote the idea of taxing pension funds.
