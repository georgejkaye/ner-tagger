A new study found that a commonly used drug for treating high blood pressure increases some risk factors associated with heart attacks and diabetes.
The surprising finding from a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> researchers said that a diuretic drug called hydrochlorothiazide reduced the body's ability to handle blood sugars, a cause of diabetes, and also increased blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, fats associated with coronary artery disease.
Hydrochlorothiazides are sold by numerous drug makers world-wide. The top-selling product containing the drug in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithkline Beecham PLC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyazide</ENAMEX>.
The study, published in today's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Journal of Medicine</ENAMEX>, said a different blood pressure drug, Capoten, doesn't cause the same problems. The finding is certain to stir up aggressive marketing battles between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capoten</ENAMEX>'s maker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb Corp.</ENAMEX>, and makers of diuretics.
Capoten and a similar drug, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasotec</ENAMEX>, sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merck & Co.</ENAMEX>, have been gaining wide use in recent years, often as substitutes for diuretics in treating mild to moderate hypertension. World-wide sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capoten</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vasotec</ENAMEX>, which are much more expensive than diuretics, are expected to be about $2 billion this year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specifically</ENAMEX>, the new study found that patients receiving the diuretic had an 11% decrease in a test that measured the body's handling of glucose, a blood sugar, while those given Capoten increased handling of glucose by 11%. The diuretic increased triglycerides by 15% and cholesterol by 6%. Capoten had no effect on the body fats.
Several researchers previously had suggested that people with high blood pressure are especially vulnerable to diabetes, and other studies have found that some diuretic drugs can modestly increase blood levels of certain fats. But the new report, by doctors at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uppsala University</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Uppsala</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sweden</ENAMEX>, is the most detailed comparison of two of the more commonly used therapies for high blood pressure.
The researchers cautioned, however, that their study provided no specific evidence that use of either type of drug increased or decreased the incidence of diabetes or heart attacks. ``It is possible, but not proved in this study, that these changes may contribute to the risk for diabetes and coronary heart disease,'' the researchers wrote in their report.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithkline</ENAMEX> said that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyazide</ENAMEX> product also contains potassium, which may counter effects seen in the study. The company also said that while some research has uncovered short-term changes like those reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> researchers, affects on cholesterol weren't upheld in longer studies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> report looked at changes over two separate four-month periods.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb</ENAMEX>, however, is already making use of the report. Last weekend, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Princeton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, company brought the report's authors, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Pollare</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Lithell</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> to meet with 25 top U.S. cardiologists. They will also be featured at a press conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> today, which will be videotaped. The tape and the study will be made available to doctors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> unit provided about $90,000, or 10%, of the study's funding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squibb</ENAMEX> shares jumped $2.50 to $122.25 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithkline</ENAMEX> shares fell 87.5 cents to close at $45.125 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday. Details of studies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> Journal sometimes reach investors prior to publication.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish</ENAMEX> researchers said they have received funding, by some other drug makers, to conduct similar studies comparing the effects of other competitive anti-hypertensive drugs on the same risk factors.
