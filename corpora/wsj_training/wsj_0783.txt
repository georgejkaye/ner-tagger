If you're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market, consider the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Savings & Loan.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> thrift has just announced a $226 million third-quarter loss. How did this happen?
Well, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in its recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX> bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by 1994, it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made. But there is a grimly ironic twist to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> loss.
As followers of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know, there is much talk in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and indeed all over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> about the need to ``encourage'' long-term investment and discourage the financial sector's presumed obsession with the short term. Now, we regard this as a largely phony issue, but the ``long term'' is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beltway</ENAMEX>. It turns out that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value. They could no longer be classified as what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> regarded them, namely long-term investments.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s ham-handed treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings reminds us of a story in the Journal earlier this year about the Baby Bell companies' desire to have the court-ordered bans lifted on offering information services. The issue of seeking relief from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> was raised to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delbert Staley</ENAMEX>, the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staley</ENAMEX> replied:
``Legislation tends to be compromised. I believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court, through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> and through state and federal regulatory agencies. I see Congress as a last resort.'' Healthy thrifts such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky. The reality of life in modern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> is that if you want to wreck something that works, let it fall into the hands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
