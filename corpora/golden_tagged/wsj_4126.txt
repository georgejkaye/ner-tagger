<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Todd Shipyards Corp.</ENAMEX> said it applied to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aro Corp.</ENAMEX> industrial equipment subsidiary as part of its plan to emerge from Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX> declined to say how much the sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aro</ENAMEX> unit might bring. It said that pending court approval, bids for the unit will be accepted through mid-November and then be evaluated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX>'s financial adviser, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Todd</ENAMEX> filed for protection from creditors in August 1987.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX> said a report by an independent consultant assessing the market for its shipyard operations concluded that its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Galveston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, shipyard ``will continue to incur substantial losses'' through fiscal 1992. The report further concluded that beyond 1992, the ``viability'' of the shipyard would depend on securing repair work for Navy vessels to be stationed at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, port scheduled to begin operations in 1992.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, for the shipyard to be profitable, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX> would have to invest in substantial capital improvements and ``improve its operating performance by instituting new marketing and project management programs.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX> said the projected operating losses and underutilization of capacity at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Galveston</ENAMEX> shipyard raise questions about the value and ``recoverability of recorded amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Galveston</ENAMEX>'s assets.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd</ENAMEX> also said that, were it forced to close the shipyard, related costs would be ``substantial.
