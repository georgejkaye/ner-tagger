Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantera's Corp.</ENAMEX> said a filing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings ``is imminent'' because its secured lenders have terminated a waiver and called in debts of $35.5 million.
The lenders, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank PLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinwort Benson Ltd.</ENAMEX>, have frozen the restaurant company's operating accounts, it said.
The lenders' actions apparently ended a last-ditch effort to reverse the declining fortunes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantera</ENAMEX>'s, prompting the resignations yesterday -- only two months after they joined the board -- of its chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen I. D'Agostino</ENAMEX> and a vice chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David C. Fraser</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D'Agostino</ENAMEX> is chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord Capital Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> merchant bank of which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fraser</ENAMEX> is president.
Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to repay its debts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantera's</ENAMEX>, which operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pizza Inn</ENAMEX> chain, received a waiver from its lenders extending until Sept. 29 a $4.6 million interest and principal payment that had been due Aug. 1. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D'Agostino</ENAMEX> said he had ``no idea'' why the lenders decided to call the loan, adding that he had expected to hear today from a potential source of fresh equity capital.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D'Agostino</ENAMEX> said the lenders informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantera</ENAMEX>'s of their decision Monday and he added, ``You can't get money when you're in that position.''
Also resigning from the board was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.D. Phillips</ENAMEX>, according to the company, which said it was reducing its board to five members from eight. It added that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack D. Harris</ENAMEX>, vice chairman, has reassumed the titles of chairman and chief executive.
At the core of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantera</ENAMEX>'s troubles, according to analysts and a shareholder suit filed in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, was the company's decision to create Italian-style buffets in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pizza Inn</ENAMEX> restaurants. The conversion ``seemed profitable,'' said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Lipton</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thalmann Ladenburg</ENAMEX>, but was insufficiently capitalized at a time when the pizza business became ``unexpectedly competitive.'' The shareholder lawsuit, meanwhile, claims the buffet concept was too risky and reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantera</ENAMEX>'s competitiveness. The company has said it believes the suit is without merit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantera</ENAMEX>'s also failed to pay interest due Sept. 1 on $6.9 million in debentures, saying a condition of its waiver prevented it from making the payments. The debentures can be declared in default 30 days after the interest payment is missed.
The company also hasn't reported fourth-quarter and year-end results for the fiscal year ended in June, but had predicted a ``substantial'' fourth-quarter loss. It reported a loss of $4 million for the first three quarters, compared with a loss of $3.2 million for the like period a year earlier.
Company officials were unavailable for further comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantera's</ENAMEX> shares closed yesterday at 37.5 cents, off $1.50 in national over-the-counter trading.
