<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, reached a standstill accord with a group of dissident shareholders and agreed to nominate a representative of the dissidents to the board.
The group, which holds 9.4% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX> and is led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward S. Buchanan</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> investor, had sought to elect three directors at the Oct. 25 annual meeting. The group had been seeking ``an immediate sale'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX> to try to boost its value to shareholders.
The standstill accord provides that the group won't increase its holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX> to more than 10% for three years. In turn, the maker of coatings, paints and household products will add <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James J. Apostolakis</ENAMEX>, designated by the holder group, as the fourth nominee on its slate. The board would expand to 10 if all four are elected.
Terms of the agreement provide that the group can nominate an additional director at the 1990 annual meeting. Should the additional nominee be named to the board, the company and the group would extend the standstill agreement for one year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX> said. If the nominee isn't elected, the standstill pact would be cut by one year.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grow Group</ENAMEX> fell 62.5 cents, to $10.50.
