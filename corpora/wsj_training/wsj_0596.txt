October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost, the official Soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation's media. For one of the superstars of glasnost, Vitaly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX>, editor of the trail-blazing weekly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogonyok</ENAMEX>, Friday, Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation.
He had been summoned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet Communist Party</ENAMEX>, after he finished his lunch at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy Hotel</ENAMEX>, an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow-beating: Eight-foot-tall Rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs, all surrounded by gilt laid on with a pastry chef's trowel and supported by marble corinthian columns whose capitals are fluting fountains of gold.
Why had Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> been called? ``I told my driver,'' he said, ``that he was taking my butt to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX> so they can..''. whack, whack, whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm. ``They feel the need from time to time to `educate' me.''
And indeed, as he later reported, that was the import of the meeting. Anxious allies of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> are cautioning media leaders to take it easy, to be careful not to do anything that could be used by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s opponents. The government is nervous. According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX>, who was present, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s publicized tongue-lashing of the press on Oct. 13 was more of a plea: ``Be careful boys; use good judgment. We're standing in gasoline, so don't smoke ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern European</ENAMEX> diplomats confirm Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX>'s assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger. In fact, a very high-ranking Soviet official told an American official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated. The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador, the Brezhnevite editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pravda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Afnasjev</ENAMEX>, was replaced by a college classmate of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brezhnevite</ENAMEX> holdovers have more to fear from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> than the verbal spanking he gave to the press.
At the end of the very week in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> was called to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ogonyok</ENAMEX> was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that 35% of the Soviet population, a plurality, believed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s economic reforms, perestroika, would result in only insignificant change.
A good measurement of the popularity of ice-breaker journals like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ogonyok</ENAMEX> is circulation. When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> took it over in 1986, it sold 250,000 copies; today it sells 3.4 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pravda</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, has retained only 57% of its 1986 readership.
Glasnost has made celebrities of men like Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX>. Prevented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> from getting on its slate of nominees for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Soviet</ENAMEX>, he stood as an independent candidate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> from his native <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ukraine</ENAMEX> and won with 84% of the vote. The same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the Party, he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX> party.
But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Censorship</ENAMEX> isn't a Marxist invention. The czars were no civil libertarians. As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines. It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives. So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society. It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history. It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point.
What is that point? Will Ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika? ``I'd be destroying myself,'' replies Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korotich</ENAMEX>, who then asks, ``What would that accomplish?'' His answer reveals his vulnerability -- it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture. It is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders.
