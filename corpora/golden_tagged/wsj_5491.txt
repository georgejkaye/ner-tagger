<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Boone Pickens</ENAMEX>, repeatedly rebuffed in his efforts to get representation on the board of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito Manufacturing Co.</ENAMEX>, is now calling on the Japanese company to increase its interim dividend as of Sept. 30 to seven yen (4.8 U.S. cents) a share from four yen a share.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> is chairman of the investment firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boone Co.</ENAMEX>, which holds 20.2% of the auto-parts maker and is its biggest shareholder. His request has been mailed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX>'s major holders, asking for their support and explaining that the company recently realized an unexpected profit of 1.2 billion yen ($8.2 million).
The unexpected earnings, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> said, are ``almost equivalent to the amount of the retained earnings brought forward into the current fiscal year,'' so increasing the dividend ``would not harm the financial stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX>.
