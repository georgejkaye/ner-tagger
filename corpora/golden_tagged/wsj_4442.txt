<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group Inc.</ENAMEX> said it plans to spin off its land holdings to shareholders, leaving the company with diverse interests in laboratory supply operations and industrial products.
The distribution of about one-quarter of the company's net worth calls for payout of one share of the newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties Inc.</ENAMEX> for each share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX>.
The proposed spinoff, slated for December, is the latest of several by four-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX>, whose chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael D. Dingman</ENAMEX>, has said the company is in ``a perpetual state of liquidation.'' Late last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henley</ENAMEX> spun off its garbage-to-energy business in a new company called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheelabrator Group Inc.</ENAMEX>
Traders greeted the latest spinoff announcement with enthusiasm. Henley class A shares surged $3.50 a share to close at $66.25 yesterday in national over-the-counter trading.
The new unit will include the properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group's Signal Landmark Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX> unit, comprising mostly undeveloped acreage in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. Also included in the package will be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX>'s headquarters building in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Jolla</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> and a 50% interest in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> oceanfront development.
According to a filing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX> has carried the real estate on its books at a value of $358.7 million, net of related debt. At June 30, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX> had a book value of $1.46 billion, net of $2.18 billion in liabilities.
Analysts said they found it hard to forecast the price at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX> stock might trade. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Lytton</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>, said on the basis of a ``back-of-the-envelope'' estimate, the shares of the new unit may trade at about $10. Yesterday's $3.50 increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX> suggests an initial market perception well short of that.
Still, watchers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX> said the spinoff will likely boost market recognition of assets that they said currently are overlooked in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Henley</ENAMEX>'s price. ``People are going to have to focus now on the values of these properties,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Jackson Blackstock</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX>
In part, valuation of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX> is clouded by the portfolio's emphasis on undeveloped land. The potential crown jewel is 1,600 acres of oceanfront near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huntington Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> The property, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolsa Chica</ENAMEX>, has been held up for nearly 25 years by local political resistance. Recently, however, opponents signed an agreement with the company that appears to clear the way for development.
For tax reasons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henley</ENAMEX>'s distribution is technically a reverse spinoff. Shareholders will receive the bulk of the company as a dividend and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX> will comprise the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henley</ENAMEX>. The transaction will be tax-free to most holders, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing suggests.
Left in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX> will be its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher Scientific Group Inc.</ENAMEX> unit, which makes and sells a wide range of laboratory equipment and instruments. Also included will be the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX>, which manufactures products ranging from industrial brake material to runways for airports.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX> will remain tied, sharing for the most part a common management. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX> will retain the right to buy at book value up to a 15% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX> also will issue a $90 million debenture to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Group</ENAMEX>. The eight-year bond will bear annual interest of 10.5% that may be paid in cash or in the form of more debentures. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley</ENAMEX> official said this payment-in-kind option was created to permit flexibility for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX>' cash flow.
The direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX> development appears open, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing, which leaves the prospect that the new company may develop its raw land holdings, sell them, or buy more.
However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingman</ENAMEX> has in the past proved adroit at mergers and acquisitions, suggesting the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henley Properties</ENAMEX> might merge with a more established developer able to make use of the extensive land holdings.
