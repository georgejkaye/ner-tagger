Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> said.
The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000, or 2.2% of those covered by unemployment insurance, from 2,205,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2%.
Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier. These figures aren't seasonally adjusted.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>. The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex Corp.</ENAMEX> workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits, the official said.
