If there is a ``Gold Coast'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Shore</ENAMEX>, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX>. Encompassing more than 50 bedroom communities north of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX> has one of the highest per-capita incomes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, according to the 1980 U.S. census.
The city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Troy</ENAMEX>, whose gleaming highrises symbolize the county's rapid economic growth in this decade, recently was named one of the nation's three largest ``boom towns of the 1990s'' by this newspaper. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomfield Hills</ENAMEX>, whose 1980 per-capita income was $37,808, is one of the wealthiest communities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX> has more than private wealth -- it also receives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Development</ENAMEX> Block Grant funds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX>. Public records show that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX> (excluding Pontiac, the county's least prosperous area) has received more than $62 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> block grants since 1975 (about two-thirds -- $40,602,915 -- between 1981 and 1989).
In the current fiscal year, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX> (again, excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX>) received $4,319,313. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s block grant program, established to assist the nation's poor, also helps <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX>'s wealthy.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> is engulfed in scandal; a series of revelations in recent months has linked agency officials to influence-peddling and the misuse of taxpayer funds, often at the behest of members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. Though it has been overlooked in the scandal, the block grant program is a classic example of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s misuse of taxpayer money. Except for the philosophical opposition of a few free-market-oriented think tanks (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heritage</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cato</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mises Institute</ENAMEX>), the block grant program has escaped scrutiny.
That should come as little surprise. Any member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> who opposes the program risks the ire of local officials receiving block grants back in the district. Reporters and editors have spent more time chasing headlines than critically examining the ``raison d'etre'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> spending.
Block grants differ from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urban Development Action Grant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">UDAG</ENAMEX>) program, established during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> administration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has defunded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UDAG</ENAMEX> program, effective this month, while block grants are still being dispensed to local officials.
Since its creation by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>, the block grant program has been popular among Republicans. GOP Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Broomfield</ENAMEX>'s district includes part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX>. Ending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> program, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broomfield</ENAMEX> contends, is unrealistic because ``there would be too much opposition at the local level. With this type of program there has been a considerable amount of support for it among local officials.'' A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broomfield</ENAMEX> aide explains, ``He's being pragmatic. They're tremendously popular with local communities.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland Township</ENAMEX> is one of the communities in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broomfield</ENAMEX>'s district where block grants have proved popular. Hidden within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s $3 billion block-grant program is a $14,775 block grant to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> Township for ``Downtown Revitalization.'' Trouble is, there is no downtown in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland Township</ENAMEX>, one of the county's newest bedroom communities. ``Downtown'' is a parking lot at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> Township hall.
Records show the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> grant is to ``purchase and improve'' the lot, located in a section known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodison</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodison</ENAMEX> is so small that it does not even have a traffic light.
``It {<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Goodison</ENAMEX>} is strange because it really doesn't exist,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Buser</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland Township</ENAMEX>'s Republican supervisor. ``If you had to define <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodison</ENAMEX>, what would you call it? It's not a village. It's not a city. It's not a street. It's an enigma.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodison</ENAMEX> may be an enigma, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> has also given <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland</ENAMEX> Township an $11,810 block grant to ``reduce interest charges for business owners in the'Goodison  Historical Area''' and a $13,543 grant to construct ``barrier free improvements'' at the township hall, records show.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> block grant funds pay for more than government parking lots and commercial revitalization in the county. Overall, one in every eight dollars received by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX> communities under the block grant program -- $1 million -- is spent on administration, records show.
Many of the projects funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> block grants in the county could be paid for at the local level through millages. Boom-city Troy will receive $161,649 in block grants in the current fiscal year for ``water system and street improvements.'' Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Doyle</ENAMEX> says abolishing the block grant program ``wouldn't have a major impact,'' although it does not make sense for the city to turn down HUD funds while they are available.
``A growth area has the ability to tax itself and finance the solution to some of those problems,'' says Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Carr</ENAMEX>, a Democrat whose district includes part of the county.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> favors tightening eligibility requirements for the program. He supports continued funding for depressed areas such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX>, which is in his district. ``For an area of economic decline and a dwindling tax base, the chances of digging yourself out of a hole are slim or none,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> said. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broomfield</ENAMEX> supports funding for upscale communities in his district and Pontiac: ``Pontiac is a community in need of assistance.'' During a July 10 speech in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> said, ``There are a lot of {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>} programs that need to be reformed -- every one. We should have the courage to close programs that don't work.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemp</ENAMEX> should start with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s block grant program, which enriches wealthy areas at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poor</ENAMEX>'s expense.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaza</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oakland County</ENAMEX> resident, is vice president for policy research at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Makinac Center</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>
