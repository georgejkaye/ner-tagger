Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cherokee</ENAMEX> and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX> to temporarily idle its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toledo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, assembly plant for the first time since April 1986.
About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid off for a week beginning Oct. 23, and overtime has been eliminated at the plant for the fourth quarter, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> spokesman said. That's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company's bullish expectations.
Sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cherokee</ENAMEX>, the best-selling Jeep, and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10% through the end of last month. But that's less than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toledo</ENAMEX> plant earlier this year.
Even when it became clear this spring that demand wasn't coming up to expectations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials ``resisted'' cutting output because Cherokee and Wagoneer are ``very profitable vehicles,'' the spokesman said.
Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials in late May slapped $1,000 cash rebates on the vehicles, including the first such incentives on the popular four-door Cherokee since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX> in 1987. The incentives boosted sales for a while, but the pace had cooled by last month.
The result: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cherokee</ENAMEX> as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comanche</ENAMEX> pickup, which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toledo</ENAMEX> also builds. A 60-day to 65-day supply is considered normal.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jasper Jeep-Eagle</ENAMEX>, one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country, inventories have continued to swell. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Lowe</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jasper</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>, dealership, said new rebates of $500 to $1,000 on the models have stimulated sales, but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks. ``If people aren't buying, you have to close plants,'' he said.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> said it will idle for four weeks the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> assembly plant that builds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Lebaron and Dodge Daytona</ENAMEX> models. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> officials said the plant is scheduled to resume production on Nov. 20., and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, said it will idle for yet another week its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Linden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, assembly plant, bringing to three weeks the total time that plant will be idled during October.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> said the assembly plant, which builds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> Corsica and Beretta compact cars, originally was scheduled to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30. The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars.
Sluggish sales of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beretta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corsica</ENAMEX> spurred <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> to offer $800 rebates on those cars. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corsica</ENAMEX> and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX>, but sales of the cars are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34.2% early this month.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> has scheduled overtime at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lordstown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Janesville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wis.</ENAMEX>, assembly plants, which build the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> Cavalier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> said it will shut down for one week its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Truck</ENAMEX> Plant because of a ``shortage of dealer orders.'' The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks. The assembly plant is scheduled to resume production on Oct. 30.
Meanwhile, the nine major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> auto makers plan to build 143,178 cars this week, down 11.7% from 162,190 a year ago and flat with last week's 142,117 car output.
