Trading volume picked up a bit, but most investors continued to show little appetite for stocks.
A late blast of computer-guided sell programs erased gains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average, which finished 3.61 lower at 2680.28 after cresting slightly above 2700. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume of 146,930,000 shares, while still modest, was the highest this week.
Traders said the program selling hit three big stocks in particular: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>, which tumbled 1 1/8 to 61 3/8; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>, which fell 1 3/8 to 121 7/8; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont</ENAMEX>, which dropped 7/8 to 117 3/8. All three are in the Major Market Index, which closely follows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average and is frequently used for program trading. Considerable computer-related activity also came in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s 500-stock index futures.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> yesterday revised its figure on second-quarter U.S. gross national product growth to 2.5% from 2.7%. Inflation as measured by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GNP</ENAMEX>-based price deflator was unchanged at 4.6%.
``What troubles us is that there has been good news on inflation and the market doesn't want to accept'' it, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Buckman</ENAMEX>, vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandywine Asset Management</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brandywine</ENAMEX>, turning defensive, has bought such cyclical issues as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPG Industries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical</ENAMEX>. The firm also has been selling shares of auto makers and buying those of airlines, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair Group</ENAMEX>. ``We feel airlines are quality companies for the long term,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buckman</ENAMEX> said.
Apparently, so do many other investors. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Transportation Index rose 8.53 to 1465.86. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, rose 3 3/8 to 81 7/8, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>, parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>, rose 1 1/4 to 286 1/4. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX>, another stock in that average, rose 2 1/2 to 54 1/2 despite a report that its first-quarter earnings fell to 58 cents a share from $1.26 a year earlier. The company said the drop primarily reflected expenses associated with the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger International.</ENAMEX>
