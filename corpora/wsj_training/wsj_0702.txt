<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal Corp.</ENAMEX>'s decision to put its Norwegian oil and [gas interests] up for sale earlier this week is another step in the company's strategic review of its properties, and shows that few of them are sacred cows.
The company declined to estimate the value of the Norwegian holding. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene L. Nowak</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX>, forecast that the sale will bring in ``$200 million or substantially more.''
The proposed transaction is the latest in a redeployment of assets by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based oil company that has included the $200 million sale of its headquarters property and the pending sale of half of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> refinery and related marketing operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nowak</ENAMEX> said he attaches particular importance to the proposed sale because it suggests that the company is willing to sell oil and gas assets that aren't part of its major strategic strengths.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> said it expects to complete the sale of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> Norge A/S unit by next March or April. In addition to an 18% stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Veslefrikk</ENAMEX> offshore field, the Norwegian unit has interests ranging from 10% to 25% in three other Norwegian oil and gas production licenses.
In 1986, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> sold a 7.5% stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Veslefrikk</ENAMEX> field to Deutsche <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Erdolversorgungs G.m.b. H.</ENAMEX>, a West German oil company, for an undisclosed amount. In 1987, it sold a 2.5% stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Veslefrikk</ENAMEX> field to the Swedish national oil company, resulting in a $7 million after-tax gain.
However, those sales were early in the field's history, before production equipment was installed. The field is currently being developed and is slated to start production by the end of the year. It's expected to produce about 62,000 barrels per day.
A company spokesman said the Veslefrikk field's gross reserves were estimated in 1987 at 229 million barrels. However, he added that that estimate, made before extensive development drilling, currently is being reappraised.
The spokesman said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal</ENAMEX> has had ``considerable interest'' from prospective buyers. The company has retained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J. Henry Schroder Wagg & Co.</ENAMEX> as financial adviser and agent for the sale.
