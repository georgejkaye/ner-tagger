Government officials from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> officials to sketch out a severe program for restructuring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s crippled economy.
Polish Finance Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leszek Balcerowicz</ENAMEX> used the occasion of the annual meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> to provide Western leaders their first glimpse of the new Solidarity-led government's economic plan. The program includes a tough anti-inflation policy, a sweeping program to convert state-owned industries to private ownership, and incentives to attract foreign investors.
``It's a courageous plan,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Beregovoy</ENAMEX>, the French finance minister, who met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balcerowicz Sunday</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> next month will send a ``mission team'' to Warsaw to begin work on a lending package designed to help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> convert its centrally managed economy to a market-based system. Officials close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> program confirmed that the conditions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> would impose before extending credit track the plans laid out by the Polish officials this week. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> has worked with many troubled economies, this would be the first time it has attempted to overhaul a centrally managed, Communist-designed one.
Officials working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> project say the most urgent task is clamping down on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s runaway inflation, which recently surged to a monthly rate of nearly 40% and which threatens to flare into hyper-inflation if left unchecked.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s economic reform has riveted world financial leaders gathered here because it represents the first comprehensive attempt to overhaul a command economy. Moreover, the Polish reform program may be used as the model for retooling other communist economies. ``The Poles are writing the textbook,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hormats</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs International.</ENAMEX>
While describing their economic objectives, Polish officials didn't offer Western leaders many details on exactly how the goals would be achieved. The specifics are likely to be worked out in consultation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>. It is expected, however, that the planned attack on inflation will include controls on wages throughout the Polish economy.
British Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> called for daring approaches to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s economic troubles and warned that ``deliberate gradualism'' would likely be counter-productive. If there is any model to follow, he argued, it should be the rebuilding of the West German economy after World War II.
In meetings with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Balcerowicz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Ryrie</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Finance Corp.</ENAMEX>, agreed to help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> create a financial system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFC</ENAMEX> officials say they are negotiating with several large western banks interested in setting up joint-venture banks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFC</ENAMEX> is an affiliate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Gustafson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFC</ENAMEX>'s investment director, said it is hoped that once a reliable financial system is in place, new investment funds will flow into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFC</ENAMEX> also agreed to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> on the planned campaign to turn industries over to private control and to consult with newly formed Polish corporations.
Hanging over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s economic prospects is its $39 billion in foreign debt, of which $26 billion is owed a group of Western government lenders known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris Club</ENAMEX>. Although major debt-relief plans likely will await completion of the IMF reforms, there are already general assurances that some relief will come. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> called for ``a far-reaching rescheduling of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s official debts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris Club</ENAMEX>,'' and hinted that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> negotiations drag on, some debt relief could be offered in advance of a final package.
