The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> said it will continue export controls on equipment used to make advanced composite materials, despite a report that such products are available to East bloc countries from other sources.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mosbacher</ENAMEX>, who announced the decision yesterday, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> will try to persuade those sources to restrict their sales of the equipment. Under current trade law, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> is required to remove export controls on products which have been found to be freely traded by other countries besides the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and its allies, unless those countries agree to cooperate in restricting the availability of those products.
The equipment, or so-called prepreg machines, is used to make a range of civilian and military products such as fishing rods and missile casings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> exported more than $5.5 million of these machines from April 1988 to April 1989.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State, Defense and Commerce departments</ENAMEX> jointly recommended retaining export controls until the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> exhausts all other means of denying the East bloc access to the equipment. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher</ENAMEX> said the equipment is of ``strategic importance'' because it could also be used to make sophisticated weaponry.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> said export controls will remain in effect for six months while negotiations with the foreign sources take place, and for an additional 12 months if there is ``progress'' in these talks. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mosbacher</ENAMEX> said the negotiations have a ``reasonable likelihood of success.''
The department said the identities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and foreign suppliers of this equipment are confidential.
