A federal appeals court ordered a judge to fine former Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramsey Clark</ENAMEX> and another lawyer for filing a frivolous suit seeking payment for damages caused by the 1986 U.S. bombing raid on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX>.
The three-judge panel in the District of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> said a federal district judge, who dismissed the suit, was wrong not to impose a fine on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX>, currently a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> lawyer, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Schilling</ENAMEX>, with whom he works.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> filed the suit last year on behalf of 55 Libyans who claimed they were injured and their property damaged by the bombing raid. They sued President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>, and also named <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> and Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX> as defendants for allowing U.S. bombers to use British air bases.
In dismissing the suit, U.S. District Court Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Jackson</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> knew the case ``offered no hope whatsoever of success.'' But the court refused to impose a fine for a frivolous suit, concluding that courts may sometimes serve as a forum for public protests.
But the appeals court said, ``We do not conceive it a proper function of a federal court to serve as a forum for protests, to the detriment of parties with serious disputes waiting to be heard.''
The opinion was signed by all three judges, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Buckley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Ginsburg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sentelle</ENAMEX>.
The appeals court also ordered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> to pay the fees for the lawyers who handled the appeal for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX> and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thatcher</ENAMEX>.
The amount of the fine for the frivolous lawsuits will be determined by the district court; the amount of the fees will be based on a bill submitted by the lawyers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACCOUNTANTS</ENAMEX> IN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FLORIDA</ENAMEX> can solicit clients.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Rampell</ENAMEX>, 37 years old, chief executive  officer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Palm Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, accounting firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rampell & Rampell</ENAMEX>, won his three-year crusade to overturn two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> laws prohibiting the state's more than 16,000 accountants from pitching for business and telling prospective clients how much they charge.
Only three other states, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX>, ban uninvited soliticitations from accountants. No other states have laws forbidding accountants from telling prospective clients how much they bill.
U.S. District Court Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Rodgers</ENAMEX> Thursday struck down the two laws as unconstitutional because they violated accountants' free-speech rights. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> failed to show that the government's interest was served by prohibiting the accountants' from soliciting and bidding for business, the judge ruled.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> probably will appeal the decision, says state Assistant Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rimes</ENAMEX>, who said he hadn't read the opinion. ``Historically, when a state statute has been declared unconstitutional, usually an appeal has been taken,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rampell</ENAMEX> says he was on the phone drumming up business less than an hour after his lawyer read him the decision.
He has a target list of 50 potential clients and hopes to land 15% of those clients within a year. ``They've taken the handcuffs off,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rampell</ENAMEX> says.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filed a civil suit against two defendants who pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> is seeking disgorgement of a total of $167,070 in alleged illegal profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton Shapiro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel J. Silverman</ENAMEX>, who pleaded guilty in the 1986 ``Yuppie Five'' case. The civil suit, filed in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, also seeks a penalty of $501,210 under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insider Trading Sanctions</ENAMEX> Act.
In 1987, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX>, a former stockbroker, was sentenced to two months in prison and fined $25,000. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX>'s former client, was given a suspended sentence, fined $25,000 and placed on three years' probation.
The case was known as the ``Yuppie Five'' case because it involved five young professionals and investors on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shapiro</ENAMEX>, 27, who now lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silverman</ENAMEX>, 26, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Providence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.I.</ENAMEX>, couldn't be reached for comment.
The other three defendants, who also pleaded guilty to charges related to insider trading, previously settled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Blackburn</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> lawyer, said the suit was filed last week because the two men had been unwilling to settle the disgorgement matter at an amount the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> considered appropriate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HENRY A. KISSINGER</ENAMEX> loses battle to block court appearance in libel suit.
While visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> to address a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council on Foreign Relations</ENAMEX>, the former secretary of state was slapped with a subpoena to testify in a libel suit against author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour Hersh</ENAMEX>.
The suit, in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, was brought by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morarji Desai</ENAMEX>, the former prime minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersh</ENAMEX> reported in a book about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desai</ENAMEX> sold Indian state secrets to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>.
In papers submitted to the court, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> said attending the trial would disrupt his business schedule. He said it would also give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersh</ENAMEX>, whom he calls a ``self-proclaimed antagonist,'' further opportunity to harass him.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> sat for two pretrial fact-finding interviews in 1984 after being promised by plaintiff's lawyers that he wouldn't have to testify at trial, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judson H. Miner</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX>'s lawyer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis, Barnhill & Galland</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> firm. But U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles R. Norgle</ENAMEX> last week ruled Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> still had to testify. He is expected to take the stand today.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desai</ENAMEX>'s lawyer says he regrets violating the agreement with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX>. But the judge's decision to prevent key portions of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX>'s pretrial interviews from being read at trial left him no choice, says the lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cyriac D. Kappil</ENAMEX>.
``We consider him important to our case, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered him,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kappil</ENAMEX> says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> doesn't share that view. He told the court he had no knowledge that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desai</ENAMEX> was a paid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> informant.
``Of course Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kissinger</ENAMEX> has his own personal views about the lawsuit,'' says his lawyer. ``But that's not really relevant.''
THE FORMER managing partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myerson & Kuhn</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> office, is joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> office of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marx, Davies & Ives</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> law firm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J. Horowitz</ENAMEX>, 51, is the former general counsel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX>.
