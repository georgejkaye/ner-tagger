Australian businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> announced a new plan to help alleviate the debt burden on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX>, including the sale of half his Australian brewing empire, his most valuable asset.
The proposal supersedes a previously announced agreement to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> brewing assets to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX>, which is 58% held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>, for 3.5 billion Australian dollars (US$2.72 billion).
Under the new plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> will sell its Australian brewing assets, which control about 40% of that country's beer market, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> for A$2.5/NNP billion. The planned sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> brewer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G. Heileman Brewing Co.</ENAMEX>, has been ``deferred for 12 months,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> said.
Once the sale of the Australian brewing assets to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> is completed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> plans to make a bid for the 42% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> it doesn't already own, at A$1.60 (US$1.24) a share. That values <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> at about A$972 million.
If this bid succeeds, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> plans to sell 50% of its Australian brewing operations to Lion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nathan Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> brewer and retailer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> company would assume management control of the brewers.
The price Lion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan</ENAMEX> will pay for its 50% holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s Australian breweries isn't final. But from figures provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>, analysts said it apparently would include an equity investment of about A$550 million in the new joint venture.
Several analysts deemed the proposal crucial to the survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>, which has been aggressively selling assets to improve its cash flow and reduce a debt load estimated by some analysts at A$6 billion. Analysts have traced the company's problems to its previous rapid expansion and reluctance among its bankers to extend more credit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Sutton</ENAMEX>, an analyst at the brokerage firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays de Zoete Wedd Australia Ltd.</ENAMEX>, estimated the proposed transactions would reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s debt by about A$1.6 billion. ``It obviously takes pressure off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s balance sheet, and allows {Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>} to remain a participant in the Australian brewing industry,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutton</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> also agreed yesterday to sell its 67.7% interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harriet</ENAMEX> oil field, off the northwestern coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, for A$220/NNP million -- at an undisclosed profit -- to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviva Petroleum Inc.</ENAMEX>, a small, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">British</ENAMEX>-based independent oil concern. And last week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> bailed out of its 20.4% stake in British conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lonrho PLC</ENAMEX> for # 312 million (US$490 million), at a loss of about # 50 million.
Yesterday's proposal is subject to several conditions, including government approvals and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> being able to acquire all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX>' shares. While some analysts give the transaction more than a 50-50 chance of being completed, it's unclear whether it will be enough to keep what is left of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bond</ENAMEX>'s corporate empire afloat. ``All the market really knows is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> has a general liquidity problem, but we don't know the extent of the cash bind,'' one analyst said.
Investors also appeared uncertain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s shares dropped two Australian cents yesterday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>, to 40 cents each. Earlier this year they were trading at more than A$1.80. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> shares rose five cents each, to A$1.25.
Besides easing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s debt burden, the proposed transactions are viewed by some analysts as a way to placate stock-exchange officials and corporate regulators who have queried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> on several aspects of the original plan, announced in late May.
Under the original plan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> paid a deposit of A$1.2 billion toward the proposed A$3.5 billion purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> brewing operations. This payment raised concern among some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX>' minority shareholders as well as corporate regulators.
The new proposal calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> to repay A$850 million of that deposit, but to defer repaying the balance until the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> brewer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Heileman</ENAMEX>, is sold. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> declined to elaborate, but one source familiar with the situation said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> expects <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. Heileman</ENAMEX>'s performance to improve over the next year, making the company easier to sell, possibly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion Nathan-Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> joint venture.
Also under the new plan, Lion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan</ENAMEX> has agreed to arrange financing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s takeover offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> company also has agreed to arrange funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> to buy back about A$600 million of bonds it has issued that are convertible into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> shares, and to arrange funds to repurchase an undisclosed amount of subordinated debentures issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> brewing interests.
