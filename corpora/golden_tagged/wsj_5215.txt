<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX> said it is expanding its line of substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons used in making foam cushioning.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Danbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, chemical maker said it has begun to market a group of chemicals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyperlite</ENAMEX>, for making cushions used by the auto industry. It is also marketing a technology, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geolite</ENAMEX>, for making cushions used as the backs and arms of furniture.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbide</ENAMEX> said manufacture of flexible foam cushioning accounts for 10% of worldwide use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cfcs</ENAMEX>, which are believed to damage the Earth's ozone shield.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Gabelman</ENAMEX>, the product manager, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geolite</ENAMEX> in many instances would replace a chemical, methylene chloride, already used as a CFC substitute. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methylene</ENAMEX> chloride is a suspected carcinogen. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabelman</ENAMEX> also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyperlite</ENAMEX> is meant partly to improve cushions for the auto industry rather than for environmental reasons. Some makers of these cushions have already learned to make do without Cfcs or methylene chloride.
