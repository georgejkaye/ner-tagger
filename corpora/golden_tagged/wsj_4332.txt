<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>, in an apparent bid to secure a new management team for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, said it agreed to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> for $200 million, or $17.50 a share, in an offer it plans to commence next week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> plans to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> for $3.4 billion, or $27 a share, including the 49% block owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX> During its discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> began searching for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> executive to run the studio. It decided on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> co-chief executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX>, a respected <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producer, to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Kaufman</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and his partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX>, who would also join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> under the arrangement, together control about 28% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>, which until recently was called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>
Analysts said the price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is offering for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> is surprisingly high given the assets of the company, which consist primarily of a percentage of revenue from the movies ``Rain Man'' and ``Batman'' and a small library of television game shows such as ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newlywed Game</ENAMEX>,'' ``The Gong Show'' and ``The Dating Game.'' The company tried to launch updated versions of those shows but they got poor ratings.
Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> shares soared $3.875 to close at $17 each in national over-the-counter trading.
``It's a very beneficial price for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> shareholders. It's far more than they might have expected from continuing operations,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Logsdon</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crowell, Weedon & Co.</ENAMEX> ``I think it's an expensive way to secure the services of two very successful individuals.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael E. Tennenbaum</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of investment banking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX>, said his firm, retained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> to provide a fairness opinion on the offer, hasn't yet reached a conclusion. But he called the price ``attractive,'' adding that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based film and TV production company ``doesn't have a great amount of assets compared to the price shareholders are getting, the main attraction is the superb record {in movie production}. The overwhelming asset they have is their management team.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> said the completion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> tender offer is subject, among other things, to ``modification of certain {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>} agreements on terms satisfactory to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>.'' As previously reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> last month signed a new five-year contract to supply movies exclusively to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> officials were taken by surprise at the news that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> wanted to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> post and sell his company to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> officials were said to be meeting over the past two days with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>, who is attempting to extricate himself from his obligations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>. Neither side could be reached. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> executives familiar with the situation noted this isn't the first time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> has tried to get his hands on a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> studio; last year, he and some associates tried to buy a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX> At the time, the executives said, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> to release him from certain obligations and he apparently believes he has a verbal commitment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> executives to do so if the opportunity to run a major studio comes up.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> Chairman and Chief Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven J. Ross</ENAMEX> is unlikely to hold Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> to a commitment that would prevent him from taking the job at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has its own interests to protect; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> has already begun developing and producing a number of movies with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> funds and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is sure to act to secure rights to those projects. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> is producing a movie version of the novel ``A Bright and Shining Lie'' in conjunction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Fonda</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and also bought rights to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Sagan</ENAMEX> novel ``Contact'' on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logsdon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Crowell Weedon</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> follows a joint venture between another large Japanese company and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gordon</ENAMEX>, an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JVC/Victor Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> agreed to invest more than $100 million to form a joint venture with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX> to produce and finance motion pictures. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JVC/Victor</ENAMEX> is 50%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ENAMEX> -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> rival.
``The trend from the Japanese perspective is to put your money behind proven talent. They need to have people with a proven track record for making movies,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logsdon</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>, a lawyer, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX>, a one-time hairdresser, sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters Co.</ENAMEX>, a private movie company, to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris Industries</ENAMEX>, a TV game show concern, in January of last year for about $32 million. At the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barris</ENAMEX> was 31%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Group Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, cement-making company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burt Sugarman</ENAMEX>. ``He promised them they would be running a studio, but when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM</ENAMEX>\ deal fell apart, they felt suckered,'' says one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sugarman</ENAMEX> has since sold his 24.4% Barris stake to an Australian venture-capital company.
Earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris</ENAMEX> said it changed its name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment</ENAMEX> to reflect ``recent changes in ownership and management.''
Separately, a group of former shareholders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tri-Star Pictures</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, which previously sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> and certain directors of both in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> Chancery Court, filed an amended complaint seeking to enjoin the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>. Tri-Star at one time was partly owned by the public before being folded into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, two separate shareholder lawsuits were filed in state court against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> and its officers and directors. The suits, which seek class-action status, allege that the purchase price to be paid by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is ``grossly inadequate.'' The suits seek to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> to negotiate a better deal with any third party that might come forward.
The amended complaint charges that the defendants breached their duty to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tri-Star</ENAMEX> shareholders over the past two years through a number of actions that resulted in huge losses for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tri-Star.</ENAMEX> The complaint also charges that Coke ``siphoned off'' profits from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tri</ENAMEX>-Star when combining it with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. As for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> transaction, the complaint says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> at a bargain price ``because it wishes to reap a huge profit now... in order to have funds available for overseas expansion of its soft drink business and to repurchase its own shares.''
A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> called the suit ``totally without merit.
