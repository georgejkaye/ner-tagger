<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> said it will create its first trade magazine by spinning off a physicians' version of its 50%-owned bimonthly consumer health and fitness magazine, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX> Magazine, the wholly owned subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>, said that, starting with its January 1990 issue, the consumer version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> will change its name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">In Health magazine</ENAMEX>. The company will publish Hippocrates as a more specialized trade magazine directed at physicians and drawing primarily pharmaceutical advertising. Both will be monthly by 1991.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> owns a 50% share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sausalito</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX>, and has an option to buy the other half in 1991. Three-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> is one of several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> publishing joint ventures, but it is the first magazine joint venture that has produced a spinoff publication.
The creation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> as a trade magazine is a move by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> to cash in on the lucrative pharmaceutical advertising market. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Marketing & Media</ENAMEX>, a trade publication, in 1988 medical advertising in trade magazines totaled $550 million, of which pharmaceutical ads represented $400 million. The consumer market for prescription drugs is estimated at $50 billion.
Pharmaceutical advertising by product is barred by federal law in consumer magazines, though <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> and other consumer magazines are allowed to carry corporate-image ads from the companies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> has avoided trade-magazine publishing, considering it reliable but not as financially rewarding as consumer magazines. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Meigher</ENAMEX>, executive vice president and group publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time magazines</ENAMEX>, said spinning off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> wasn't an indication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> was making a wholesale move into trade magazines. However, he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> could explore trade spinoffs of existing titles, such as a magazine for top financial executives derived from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner's Money magazine</ENAMEX>.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> has won two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Magazine</ENAMEX> awards in two years, the name has generally been a difficult sell to a wide consumer audience. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meigher</ENAMEX> said he is hoping to accelerate the circulation growth with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">In Health</ENAMEX> name. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX>, subtitled ``The magazine of health & medicine,'' has paid circulation of about 400,000, in addition to 125,000 copies sent free to doctors' waiting rooms.
``You hate to mess with a success, but we think that with the name In Health we'll have greater success in developing circulation,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meigher</ENAMEX>. ``We can go further with that name than with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> gives us more accessibility.''
In Health will have stiff competition from a group of more established health-related magazines, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Health Partners' American Health, Family Media Inc.</ENAMEX>'s Health, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodale Press</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conde Nast Publications' Self</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weider Publications' Shape magazine</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> will carry largely pharmaceutical ads directed at 120,000 physicians -- including general and family practitioners, internists, and cardiologists -- who will receive it free. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> will have editorial matter similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">In Health</ENAMEX>, but with some added features that address physicians' interests.
``We found physicians were reading our magazine like crazy because it helped them keep up with patients,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Schrier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX>' founder and editor. ``We had a great franchise with the consumer, but we found we could expand it by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocrates</ENAMEX> name to attract doctors.
