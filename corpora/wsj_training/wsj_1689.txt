What's in a name? Apparently a lot, according to the British firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins & Sells</ENAMEX>.
The British firm has begun court proceedings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> to prevent the use of the name ``Deloitte'' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins & Sells</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touche Ross & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> and the rest of the world. The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Touche</ENAMEX> world-wide and joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers & Lybrand</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bullock</ENAMEX>, senior partner of Deloitte in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, said ``the decision to start these proceedings hasn't been taken lightly.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bullock</ENAMEX> said the British firm has used the name ``Deloitte'' since 1845. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins & Sells</ENAMEX> was known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins & Sells</ENAMEX> until 1978, when it added the ``Deloitte'' name of its British affiliate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Burton</ENAMEX>, an accounting professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia University</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Graduate School of Business</ENAMEX>, said ``there's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>, where accounting predates the U.S.'' Although accountants aren't noted as ``being deeply emotional, they really hold it all in,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton</ENAMEX>, former chief accountant of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Michael Cook</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haskins & Sells International</ENAMEX>, said he believes the legal action by the British firm ``to be without merit.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX> said that last June, the international executive committes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Touche</ENAMEX> agreed to a world-wide merger. ``The merger is proceeding according to plan, except as to the withdrawal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deloitte U.K.</ENAMEX> firm,'' he said.
Partners at other accounting firms say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX> firm in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> is filing the suit to get even with the merged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Touche</ENAMEX> firm for keeping major auditing work in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX> audit client, for example, has agreed to keep its annual $18 million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Touche</ENAMEX> firm, to be known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte & Touche</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>, this would mean that the British <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX> would lose revenue for its audit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vauxhill</ENAMEX> unit.
The defection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte</ENAMEX>'s affiliates in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers & Lybrand</ENAMEX> will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, rivaling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KPMG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peat Marwick</ENAMEX> there. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers</ENAMEX> hasn't been courted by other major accounting firms for a merger, it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte-Touche</ENAMEX> merger.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harris Amhowitz</ENAMEX>, general counsel of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coopers</ENAMEX>, said Coopers ``was aware of the litigation,'' but he declined further comment. He also declined to comment on the name that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers</ENAMEX> would use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte UK</ENAMEX> won its litigation to keep its name. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers</ENAMEX> uses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coopers & Lybrand</ENAMEX> name world-wide.
