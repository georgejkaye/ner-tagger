<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> share prices advanced broadly under the lead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and other electrical issues, pushing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index to a record high in relatively active trading. Prices dropped sharply in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, however.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> average climbed 484.11 points to stand at 35444.82 at the end. That comfortably surpassed the previous record of 35140.83 set Aug. 21. The sizable gains spawned speculation among traders that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market will continue to rise for a while.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Wednesday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index advanced another 206.72 points to 35651.54.
On Tuesday, share prices started sprinting ahead from the outset and continued to build up momentum throughout the day. Volume on the first section was estimated at 900 million shares, growing from 784 million the previous session. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stock price index of all issues listed in the first section rose 32.02 points to 2675.22.
Behind the market's broad advance, traders said, was a welling sense of anticipation that the yen will finally be able to stabilize itself against the dollar following last week's agreement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> by the so-called Group of Seven major countries that the U.S. currency is overvalued. This week's intervention by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Japan</ENAMEX> and other central banks to hold the dollar down raised expectations that the yen may regain its former strength, according to traders.
In the morning, traders said, trading was out of focus and buy orders were scattered over a wide range of issues. In the afternoon, however, the focus sharpened. The market fixed its attention on electricals such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanuc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer Electronic</ENAMEX>, among others.
Buyers hunted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> on news that the company is now in the final stages of negotiations involving a cash purchase of all the shares outstanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> declined comment on the reports from the U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> gained 410 yen to stand at 8,810 yen ($62). Its rise took other electricals up on its coattails. Among the other gainers were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Industrial</ENAMEX>, up 70 at 2,390, and Pioneer, up 170 at 5,370.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanuc</ENAMEX> went up 500 to 8,000. Traders traced the gain to expectations that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanuc</ENAMEX>, one of the country's major manufacturers of industrial robots, will boost its sales and earnings this fiscal year because of growing demand from companies pouring money into efforts to upgrade their production equipment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> shares plummeted on worse than expected U.K. trade and current account deficits, pushing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Times</ENAMEX> 100-share index to its lowest close in more than two months.
The index, the most closely watched market measurement, closed 23.5 points lower at 2336.1. The index opened stronger, hitting a session high of 2368.4, but the technically important 2350 level was erased before midday. The 100-share index failed to rebound substantially even though <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> showed strength in early dealings.
The 30-share index ended 23.8 points lower at 1913.5. Volume was 450.8 million shares, a fairly light session, but higher compared with a 1989 low of 280.5 million shares Monday.
The third-worst monthly trade deficit on record proved too big a challenge for the market to overcome, dealers said.
``We had an attack of the jitters after the trade figures,'' a dealer with a large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> brokerage firm said. ``The market came off a little too sharply.''
While the trade report drew substantive selling into the market, dealers said knee-jerk concerns over U.K. interest rate increases subsided and helped keep the key index from an even sharper decline. ``After the initial selling {following the trade data}, people began reappraising the interest-rate picture,'' a dealer with another large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> brokerage firm said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries</ENAMEX>, a big part of the 100-share index, managed to remain in positive territory throughout the session, closing at 818 pence ($13.20), up 2 pence, on 9.6 million shares traded.
Although it fell sharply in late and thin dealings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> was supported by news that the conglomerate, which faces a hostile bid from Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Goldsmith</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake</ENAMEX>, is moving to inject more shareholder value into the company by spinning off some assets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX>, another hostile takeover target, ended higher after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pembridge Investments</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bermuda</ENAMEX>-registered holding company headed by a former colleague of Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX>, launched a bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> paper and packaging concern. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRG</ENAMEX> closed at 609, up
Share prices on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frankfurt Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> closed sharply lower in active trading, pressured by a lower dollar and fears of rising interest rates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAX</ENAMEX> index tumbled 26.90 to 1609.03.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Equities</ENAMEX> began to slide at the opening, and the sell-off accelerated in the course of the session, brokers said.
``The market is caught between a rock and a hard place,'' said one broker at a West German bank. ``The dollar is falling, which is bad for exports, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> still seems determined to raise its rates.''
Hopes that the central bank will refrain from raising its discount and Lombard rates soon because of the dollar's plunge to 1.90 marks were dashed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Otto Poehl</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poehl</ENAMEX> said Monday that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> is pondering whether current interest rates are consistent with the strong economic growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. Most observers are now counting on a rate increase Oct. 5, the next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Bank Council</ENAMEX> meeting.
The main sellers were domestic institutional investors, brokers said. Many foreign operators are holding on to their stocks because of expected currency gains from a stronger mark, they added.
Blue-chip stocks, especially automobile issues, had the heaviest losses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daimler Benz</ENAMEX> plunged 18.5 marks to 777.5 marks ($409), and traders said the company might delay its huge share issue a bit longer to wait for the share price to recover.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> dropped 12.9 to 463.1, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayerische Motoren Werke</ENAMEX> slumped 12.5 to 624.
Banking stocks were also sharply lower, as analysts fear that another rate increase will put pressure on the banks' interest margins. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank</ENAMEX> plummeted 14.5 to 683.5, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dresdner Bank</ENAMEX> skidded 9.8 to 354, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayerische Vereinsbank</ENAMEX> fell 10 to 380.
Meanwhile, prices closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan</ENAMEX>, and mixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
Shares closed higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sydney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellington</ENAMEX>, were mixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> and lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX>.
Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.
