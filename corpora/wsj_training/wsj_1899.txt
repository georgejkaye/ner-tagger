This temblor-prone city dispatched inspectors, firefighters and other earthquake-trained personnel to aid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. But a secondary agenda among officials in the City of Angels was to learn about the disaster-contingency plans that work and those that don't.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Bradley</ENAMEX> used the opportunity to push the City Council harder to pass a measure establishing a loss-recovery reserve of $100 million. The amount would help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> cope in the first few weeks after its own anticipated quake, while waiting for federal assistance to arrive.
After <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Agnos</ENAMEX> spoke on television of the need for building inspectors to check the soundness of buildings, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> dispatched 32 inspectors to help. And the county of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert, ready to send in reinforcements, and alerted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal.
Two <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> radio stations initiated Red Cross donation campaigns, and one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> bank manager forked over $150,000 of his own money for relief purposes, the Red Cross said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> Red Cross sent 2,480 cots, 500 blankets, and 300 pints of Type-O blood. It is also pulling 20 people out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, who were helping Huricane Hugo victims, and sending them to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> instead.
