<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MINORITY RECRUITING</ENAMEX> has yet to meet hopes raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration.
Six months ago, as some personnel specialists saw it, a perception that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> really cared about fair employment -- after what they said was eight years of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>-era neglect -- was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females, blacks and other minorities. The perception lingers, says an official at a major industrial company. But so far, he declares, there's little evidence the ``new urgency'' is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring. ``Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity?'' he asks.
The recruiting ``hasn't materialized,'' asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Christian</ENAMEX>, who runs a search agency. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Hall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Howard University</ENAMEX>'s placement director, also doesn't see it. And he questions the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> dedication. ``I don't think the Bush administration has done anything,'' he says. Recruiter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Clark</ENAMEX> does note an increase in searches for minority candidates.
But some of the activity, he says, may reflect a rush to get ``numbers in order'' for end-of-year reports.
PAY FOR <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERFORMANCE</ENAMEX> hangs mostly on boss's subjective view.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont Co.</ENAMEX> in a couple of units has installed objective tests based on earnings or return on equity. Many companies have set up machinery to assure workers a fair shake. At most firms, though, it's the immediate supervisor who decides the merit increases subordinates will be paid. Managers have ``some very broad discretion,'' says an official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unocal Corp.</ENAMEX>'s top management sets guidelines, but line supervisors slice up the merit pie.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus Development Corp.</ENAMEX> feeds its evaluations into a computer, but only for storage; the decisions are made by supervisors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey Foods Corp.</ENAMEX> strives for fairness by basing increases on quarterly reviews, annual appraisals and meetings with workers. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemfix Technology Inc.</ENAMEX>, each supervisor's recommendation must be approved by the next boss up the line, and then sanctioned by a salary review committee.
JAPANESE COMPANIES fare best in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> when they give Americans more say.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Michigan</ENAMEX> researchers find the companies earn more and win a bigger market share when their American employees get a voice in planning, product development and design, including decision-making back in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. ``You can't hire competent Americans and say, `Let them run only their own show,''' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Pucik</ENAMEX>, who headed the study run with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egon Zehnder International</ENAMEX>, a search firm.
The researchers say many Japanese companies err in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> by adopting the American practice of hiring managers on the ``open market.'' In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, by contrast, companies tend to develop their own talent and promote from within. The Japanese also are accused of keeping their cards too close to their vests. ``Some Japanese executives are not yet... comfortable about sharing strategic information with their American colleagues,'' the researchers say.
Americans stay longer with Japanese firms than American companies. But they think promotions are limited.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HOUSE</ENAMEX> votes down a proposal to put pension plans under the control of joint labor-management boards. Some consultants had insisted it wouldn't work.
LONG-TERM care insurance gains favor. More than half the people surveyed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee Benefit Research Institute</ENAMEX> say they would be willing and able to pick up most of the cost of the coverage.
FRINGE-BENEFIT spending by small and medium-sized employers has dropped to 25% of payroll from 29% three years ago, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of Business Management</ENAMEX>, an advisory service.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OUSTED</ENAMEX> EXECUTIVES over 50 years old take slightly less time than their younger colleagues to find a job -- 3.23 months vs. 3.26 for the juniors -- outplacement firm Challenger, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> & Christmas finds. It's the first time in the survey's 15 years that the over-50 group came out ahead.
FEAR OF AIDS hinders hiring at few hospitals. Dedication runs high.
Wafaa <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El-Sadr</ENAMEX>, who heads the AIDS program at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York City</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlem Hospital Center</ENAMEX>, can't find help. ``I've been recruiting every single day since it's been identified that many AIDS patients come from the inner city,'' she says. She was the only staff physician available to treat AIDS patients last summer and now she has the help of only two doctors part time. Part of the problem, though, may reflect a general unwillingness to work with the urban poor.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parkland Memorial Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> says it hasn't had any problem recruiting, even after a nurse contracted the virus while injecting an AIDS patient. ``I can tell you that nobody quit over it. No one panicked,'' a spokeswoman says. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Paul Medical Center</ENAMEX>, also in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, sees only a ``minimal erosion'' of support staff due to AIDS. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Haven Hospital</ENAMEX> sees no problem, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fenn</ENAMEX>, the chief of staff.
``There are enough enlightened and spirited individuals who know their responsibilities,'' he says.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHECKOFF</ENAMEX>: At least somebody gains on layoffs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms</ENAMEX> says the industry's volume has soared tenfold since 1980, to $350 million a year.... And somebody loses on the expected repeal of Section 89, the benefits test fought by most employers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Triad Solutions</ENAMEX> says software producers had each invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs that now have no use.
