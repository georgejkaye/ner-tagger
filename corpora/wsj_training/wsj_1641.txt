The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Toronto</ENAMEX> stepped deeper into the contest for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught Biosciences Inc.</ENAMEX> by reaching an unusual agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron Corp.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars ($21.3 million) over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker. It said $10 million would go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> have made a joint bid of C$866 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut Merieux S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> has made a rival bid of C$942 million. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> is seeking an injunction against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> bid, arguing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>'s predecessor company agreed in 1972 that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>'s ownership wouldn't be transferred to foreigners.
The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> are successful with their lower bid. It said the new agreement would ``replace'' the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX> takeover. ``Notwithstanding foreign ownership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>, this accord would enhance research and development in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Keffer</ENAMEX>, the university's vice president of research.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Emeryville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
In a statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques-Francois Martin</ENAMEX>, director general of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merieux</ENAMEX>, said the French company is still determined to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX>. While he didn't comment directly on the pact between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and the university, he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Merieux</ENAMEX> can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies ``not currently producing and marketing vaccines {who} can only promise this for some... years in the future.''
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught</ENAMEX> closed at $28.625, up $1.25.
