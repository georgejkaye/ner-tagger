First there was the Power Lunch. Then came the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power Tie.</ENAMEX>
Power Entertaining may be next.
To cushion the leap into the dog-eat-dog business world, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">De Land</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stetson University School of Business Administration</ENAMEX> this fall is offering a 12-part seminar with a major section dubbed ``power entertaining.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Classes</ENAMEX> will focus on such powerful topics as social conversation (``avoid being judgmental''), etiquette (``stand up when a person enters the room''), planning for social occasions (``seat the honored guest on the hostess's right''), dressing for success and, in case of overseas clients, cross-cultural entertaining.
``As the students become emerging professional types, they're going to be expected to host social occasions,'' says marketing professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Barnett</ENAMEX>, who thought up the idea. ``Unless you've read a book on it or come from a family that did a lot of entertaining,'' there isn't much chance to learn it, he notes.
While teaching a sales management course last spring, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnett</ENAMEX> recruited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Lee</ENAMEX>, wife of Stetson President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Douglas Lee</ENAMEX>, to give a few lectures on entertaining -- and she was impressed with the students' interest. So Stetson agreed to give the concept some more, well, power, and offer the non-credit program.
This type of course isn't yet standard fare at other business schools. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> spokesman says the closest thing its business school offers -- besides a ``dress for success'' student fashion show -- is a course on ``Power and Politics.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> business schools have equally slim pickings. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wharton</ENAMEX> has an ``Executive Life Style'' seminar series on skills from wine tasting and stress management to executive dressing.
Business schools ``are scared of it {teaching entertaining} now. But five years from now, they'll all have it,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Letitia Baldrige</ENAMEX>, who wrote a book on executive manners and lectures at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wharton.</ENAMEX> ``We're not talking about being aristocratic. We're talking about being efficient.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnett</ENAMEX> concedes his brainchild initially ``got a lot of ribbing from the faculty.'' But, he notes, studies of group dynamics show he's not entirely out to lunch: ``The person who plans a good party is the same person who's a good manager when you get a group together.
