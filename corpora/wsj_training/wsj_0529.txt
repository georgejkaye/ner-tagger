<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcanada Pipelines Ltd.</ENAMEX> said it plans to shift its headquarters to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calgary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> next year to cut costs and be closer to the upstream natural-gas industry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Maier</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of the natural-gas pipeline and marketing concern, said the company's future growth is ``increasingly linked'' to decisions made by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calgary</ENAMEX>-based gas producers.
``Since deregulation of the market in 1985, producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maier</ENAMEX> said. ``It's a matter of being close to those suppliers; many of those companies don't know us as well as they should.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcanada</ENAMEX> transports all gas that moves eastward from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX>. That includes all the gas consumed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>, along with the bulk of Canadian gas exports to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Litvinchuk</ENAMEX>, vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calgary</ENAMEX>-based gas marketing concern, said the industry will welcome the move.
``Having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Litvinchuk</ENAMEX> said. ``Since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers' ability to sell it, it helps to have input and access to transportation companies.''
The move, which could cost Transcanada as much as 50 million Canadian dollars (US$42.5 million) in relocation and severance payments, should be complete by next summer, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maier</ENAMEX> said. All 700 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based employees will be offered positions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calgary</ENAMEX>, the company said.
The company will save between C$4 million and C$6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calgary</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maier</ENAMEX> added.
Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the Transcanada pipeline through tolls, which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transcanada</ENAMEX> is 49.1% owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX>-based holding company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE Inc.</ENAMEX>
