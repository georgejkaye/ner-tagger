<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acclaim Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> expects to report that net income for its fiscal year ended Aug. 31 as much as doubled from the previous year, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory E. Fischbach</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
Net rose to between $8.5 million and $9.5 million, or 53 cents to 55 cents a share, from the year-earlier $4.7 million, or 28 cents a share, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischbach</ENAMEX> said. The year-ago figure is adjusted for a 1-for-2 reverse stock split effected July 24, 1989. Revenue advanced between 74% and 77%, to between $68.5 million and $69.5 million, from the year-ago $39.3 million.
For the first nine months of 1989, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acclaim</ENAMEX> earned $6.1 million, or 36 cents a share, on sales of $44.1 million.
The publisher, marketer and distributor of home-video entertainment products, founded in March 1987, said it expects to report that its available cash climbed to $14 million from $10 million a year ago. A plan to raise an additional $25 million through the sale of debentures has been ``temporarily suspended,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischbach</ENAMEX> said in an interview, ``because it would look like we're heavily into junk bonds.''
Acclaim ties the results to the continuing popularity of home video games. The company creates games for use on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo Co.</ENAMEX>'s equipment, and programs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wrestlemania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rambo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wizards</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warriors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tiger-Heli</ENAMEX> have helped the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> accounts for about 80% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acclaim</ENAMEX>'s sales.
In national over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acclaim</ENAMEX> closed at $6.75, down 12.5 cents.
With a stock-market valuation exceeding $140 million, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acclaim</ENAMEX> continues to look for acquisitions and has retained investment banker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney Inc.</ENAMEX> to help.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischbach</ENAMEX>, who in the fiscal fourth quarter reduced his stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acclaim</ENAMEX> to 35% from 40%, said he was interested in book, magazine and music publishing companies, though the company has no acquisitions on the horizon.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> market has grown from 10 million homes in 1988 to about 20 million by the end of this year,'' he said. But he notes a natural danger in tying the future of a company to a product that could be pigeon-holed as a fad. ``I'm always concerned about how fickle the market is,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischbach</ENAMEX>. ``But we're continuing to look for new opportunities and new companies for our software programs.
