The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Workers of America</ENAMEX> rejected a tentative contract agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Telesis Group</ENAMEX>, sending negotiators back to the bargaining table.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> officials, who called the rejection vote ``overwhelming,'' met over the weekend to identify provisions that will be renegotiated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CWA</ENAMEX> representative and the regional telephone company had reached a tentative agreement a month ago, ending a three-week strike.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CWA</ENAMEX> represents about 42,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Telesis</ENAMEX> employees in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nevada</ENAMEX>.
A spokeswoman said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Telesis</ENAMEX> doesn't anticipate another strike and expected to return to the bargaining table soon. The union had raised concerns about health benefits, job relocations, job security and differences in pay between urban and rural areas.
