The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy continues to grow modestly, but conditions still vary substantially from region to region, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> report said.
Manufacturers say conditions are ``generally satisfactory or improving'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, but weakening in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> and parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, according to the report, which was based on surveys conducted by district <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> banks in early September and late August.
The consumer spending picture is mixed, with retailers in some regions noting new strength and others reporting softer sales, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> found. The farm economy is improving everywhere. And there is little sign of accelerating inflation.
In short, the economy is performing about as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> hoped: It is growing slowly enough to avoid an outbreak of inflation, but fast enough to chase away recession jitters. ``My perception is that things are moving along at a fairly low pace, but at an appropriate pace for this stage of an expansion,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Black</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Resrve Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
The report offers clues into the thinking of the 12 district bank presidents as they prepare for the next scheduled meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s policy-setting group Oct. 3.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> hasn't made a move since it pulled short-term interest rates down a bit in late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. The Bush administration continues to privately urge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to ease again, particularly in light of the recent run-up in the dollar. Lower U.S. interest rates would help restrain the dollar.
But several of the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> presidents are resisting any further easing moves unless the economy exhibits new signs of weakness.
The most upbeat reports came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> regions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Fed noted ``some recent signs of strengthening,'' although demand for consumer loans is off. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> Fed said business expectations for the rest of the year are ``somewhat brighter than before.'' And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco Fed</ENAMEX>, which covers everything west of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX>, reported ``a healthy pace.''
In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> Fed reported slower growth with several industries returning to summer shutdowns that they had skipped in recent years. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> Fed said the commercial real estate market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> is softening. For the third month, more industrial companies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> region report declining business activity than report improvements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Louis Fed</ENAMEX> said no sector of that region's economy is showing significant employment growth. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> Fed said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> manufacturing expansion ``appears to have ebbed.''
On the inflation front, all the reserve banks that made comments were optimistic. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> manufacturers, for instance, uniformly reported flat or falling material prices, although a third of them mentioned recent or anticipated price increases ranging from less than 1% to 5%. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>, recent union settlements generally call for wage increases of 4% or less, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> Fed noted.
