Two West German chemical companies announced steps that apparently are designed to boost the chemical industry's standing among environmental groups and the general public.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst AG</ENAMEX>'s Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Hilger</ENAMEX> said the company wants to have a substitute product to completely replace ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons by 1995. In April, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX>, the largest producer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cfcs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, said it wanted to reduce production of the product by 50% by 1993.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hilger</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> will invest 50 million marks ($27.2 million) in a plant to make a substitute product it has developed that it says is unchlorinated. The company hopes the new plant, likely to be built in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, will be able to produce 10,000 tons a year. This year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX> will produce about 62,000 tons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cfcs</ENAMEX> in factories in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>.
Of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoechst</ENAMEX>'s 40.9 billion marks in group sales in 1988, 200 million marks came from sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cfcs</ENAMEX>.
Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BASF AG</ENAMEX>, another large chemicals company, said it formed a separate division that will study the environmental impact of plastics and will investigate all possibilities of recycling plastics.
