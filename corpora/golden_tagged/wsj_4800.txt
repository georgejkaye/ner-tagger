A surge in truck sales by [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> in sales of North American-built vehicles in mid-September.
But auto makers still face a sales environment that gives them and their dealers the jitters. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor Co.</ENAMEX> announced late yesterday that, beginning next week, it's closing a truck plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> for one week and a car-assembly plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> for two weeks. The company cited ``a shortage of dealer orders.''
Consumers bought 342,492 domestic-made vehicles in the period ended Sept. 20, compared with 270,299 a year earlier. There were nine selling days in the latest period compared with eight a year ago, so based on the daily rate the sales increase was 12.6%.
Sales of North American-made cars alone, excluding trucks, rose to 211,966 vehicles from 170,988 in the like 10-day, year-ago period. That produced a strong annual selling rate of 8.4 million cars, according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> formula.
The overall sales increase was led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> trucks, which shot up 45% to 62,064 vehicles in mid-September. Bargain-hunting buyers responded to particularly generous incentives that included cash rebates to customers and cash incentives to dealers who met sales quotas. In addition, on the Chevy S-10 pickup, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> also made cash awards to dealership sales personnel.
``You're getting the shrewd buyers,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R.E. Cochran</ENAMEX>, whose family owns two dealerships in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> area. ``You really have the people that are out for every nickel and dime.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s domestic car sales also registered a healthy 11.2% increase, helped by customer rebates and the extra incentive of cash awards to dealers who met sales targets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX>, which offered customer rebates but no special cash incentives to dealers, posted a 2.6% gain in domestic cars and a 4.5% gain in domestically made trucks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s disclosure that it will close its truck plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>, for one week seems to indicate that the company is losing ground in its truck-sales battle with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> division. Chevy traditionally has led the nation in pickup truck sales, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ford</ENAMEX> has taken over top spot in the past three years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s truck sales have been hurt by a continuing shortage of trucks with automatic transmissions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> has recently expanded its capacity to build automatic transmissions, and plans to put more of them in its 1990 model pickups.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>'s closure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lorain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, car-assembly plant reflects slow sales of the Thunderbird and Cougar coupes built there. The Thunderbird SC won <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Trend magazine</ENAMEX>'s coveted car of the year award, but the car's sales have proved disappointing. The two plant closedowns together will idle 4,700 employees.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler Corp.</ENAMEX>'s domestic car sales increased 2.1%, while its mid-September domestic truck sales rose a mere 0.7%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s sales of domestically built cars rose 64.7% from a year earlier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> dealers also are slashing prices to move out 1989-model automobiles. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Klawitter</ENAMEX>, sales manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardena Honda Automobiles</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gardena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, said a 1989 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> Accord LX car with a standard transmission is selling for about $12,500, $700 to $800 cheaper than its price a few months earlier.
Auto makers continue to worry that the brisk sales in the waning weeks of the 1989 model year will give way to a slump after the 1990 model year begins next week. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> have taken the unusual move of putting incentives on their 1990 models before they officially go on sale.
