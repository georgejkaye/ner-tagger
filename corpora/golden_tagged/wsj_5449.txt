A federal judge ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Mine Workers</ENAMEX> to end its occupation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston Co.</ENAMEX> coal preparation plant or pay additional multimillion-dollar fines.
District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glen M. Williams</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Abingdon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, ordered the 100 UMW members and hundreds of union supporters gathered outside the plant to leave by last night. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX> officials vowed to remain. The union already faces millions of dollars of fines related to the five-month strike at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX>.
The group moved into the Moss No. 3 preparation plant, located near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dante</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, on Sunday as part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX>'s strike against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, company.
The judge ruled that if the group doesn't leave, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX> must pay damages to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX> for all losses resulting from the occupation of the plant. Since Sunday, all coal processing at the plant has stopped.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX> will be fined $600,000 for each day it ignores the judge's order. The ruling also calls for additional fines against leaders of the group.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Odom</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX>'s coal group, said the plant handled 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX>'s coal processing prior to the strike.
