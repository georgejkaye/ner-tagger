You may know that ``there's a sunny little, funny little melody started by a native down in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Waikiki.</ENAMEX>'' In case you didn't know, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Garland</ENAMEX> wants to make sure you do.
For three hours this weekend, the disk jockey is going to spin almost 100 versions of ``The Hawaiian War Chant,'' a dance ditty written in the 1930s by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Noble</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Freed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leleiohaku</ENAMEX>. Last spring, he played 50 versions of the song in a two-hour program.
``I enjoy Hawaiian music,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX> says. He admits he specializes in things that don't get heard, things like ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ta-Hu-Wa-Hu-Wai</ENAMEX>,'' things you wouldn't expect to hear on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WNYC</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FM</ENAMEX>, a classical music station that broadcasts his ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spinning on Air</ENAMEX>'' program.
After hearing about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX>'s show in March, a collector who runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aloha International Steel Guitar Club</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, mailed off a tape of more than 100 additional versions, prompting this weekend's show. (The collector told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX> he alphabetized his 60,000 records and found 800 Chant versions by the time he got through the letter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.)</ENAMEX>
There is a bit of a dispute over when ``The Hawaiian War Chant'' was written. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI Music Publishing</ENAMEX> owns rights to the song and says it was introduced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Dorsey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">His Orchestra</ENAMEX> in 1936, yet Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX> has a version he claims was recorded in 1934.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spike Jones & His City Slickers</ENAMEX> variation, featuring the vocals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wacky Waikikians</ENAMEX>, took the song to No. 8 on U.S. pop charts in 1946, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI</ENAMEX>, which isn't sure how many times the song has been recorded. Some others who put out versions include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Charles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buddy Rich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Mancini</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ella Fitzgerald</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bette Midler</ENAMEX>.
Alas, the war chant isn't a true Hawaiian chant, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Kaina</ENAMEX>, a native <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> and the eastern regional director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> Visitors Bureau here. ``The'War Chant' is good fun, but in the old days the music was strictly serious,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaina</ENAMEX>, who also holds a master's degree from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manhattan School of Music</ENAMEX>.
That hasn't fazed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX>, who's known for his musical schizophrenia. Last week, the 34-year-old jock did three hours of kiddie songs, and for ``people who couldn't get away'' over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Day</ENAMEX>, he spun tunes mentioning faraway places.
