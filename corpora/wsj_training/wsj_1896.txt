<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sterling Software Inc.</ENAMEX> said it lost its bid to supply software services to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Administration</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ames Research Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moffett Field</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> Sterling, which estimated the value of the contract at $150 million, said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations.
In 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract, claiming it had submitted the lowest bid. As a result, last March the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration</ENAMEX> board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract.
Sterling said it had requested a briefing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> but had not decided whether to protest the agency's latest decision.
