<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>'s effort to hire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> as chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> hangs on some complex legal negotiations this week aimed at disentangling the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producer from a five-year contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> last week agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> for $3.4 billion and subsequently made a $200 million offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based film and TV production company where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> is co-chief executive with partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> said the offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>, however, is contingent on the ``modification'' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreement ``on terms satisfactory to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> representatives are scheduled to meet today with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> to try to hammer out a settlement. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, for its part, maintains that ``we have a binding contract.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> advisers Friday said the company is prepared to take legal action to protect its interests and has already notified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> that it may consider a suit against the Japanese electronics giant for inducing a breach of contract between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>. Among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> is likely to seek a hefty financial settlement for the loss of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX>'s services and for any damages from his withdrawal as a producer on a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> movies.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> had made it clear that it is going to assert its rights and, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> wants these guys, they are going to have to come to terms with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> adviser. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> team produced, among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>'s blockbuster hit ``Batman'' and is deeply involved in future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> projects that include sequels to that film.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> said, ``we are hopeful that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX> can work out their problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> in a satisfactory manner.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> officials indicated they weren't concerned about threats of a breach of contract suit by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>. At issue in the battle between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, which is in the process of being acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX>, is the five-year contract, signed one month ago, that provides that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> will produce movies exclusively for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX> studio. The contract extends an agreement originally signed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Christensen</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christensen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White, Miller, Fink & Jacobs</ENAMEX> is outside counsel for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>, said a combination of oral agreements between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and the producers and certain language in the new contract clearly allow for the two producers to extricate themselves from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> agreement should the opportunity to own or run a major studio come up.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> officials have declined  to discuss specifics of the contract, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christensen</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has previously consented to release Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> from their obligation: once last year when the two launched a failed bid to buy a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX> and once in 1987, when the duo was having exploratory talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>. The new five-year contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> actually omitted language that prohibited Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> from working ``in any other capacity in the motion picture industry,'' while keeping a provision that they not serve as producer or executive producer on any film other than one for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christensen</ENAMEX> said.
In a business where relationships are key, executives of rival <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> studios said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> made a serious tactical error in negotiating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> without discussing the plan with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> first. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christensen</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has long been aware of the efforts of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> to own or run a major studio and was aware at least a month ago that discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> had occurred. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> has known for two years that this is a goal and a plan of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX>,'' he said. ``It's all been very open and honest and public.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christensen</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> are prepared to give up substantial financial benefits to settle the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> contract, including rights to participate in sequels to ``Batman'' and fees from past and future movies, as well as rights to various scripts and projects they have acquired on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> would give up 10 to 15 years of rolling inventory at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christensen</ENAMEX> said. ``It's a considerable financial sacrifice.'' Among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> is producing movie versions of the best sellers ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' ``A Bright and Shining Lie'' and ``Contact'' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>.
``Everybody will benefit if this is resolved quickly and in a dignified manner,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christensen</ENAMEX> said. ``But if we have to litigate it, we will.
