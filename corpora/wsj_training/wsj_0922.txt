Western European leaders who favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their arsenal: the dizzying political changes under way in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
French President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Mitterrand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Delors</ENAMEX>, Spanish Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felipe Gonzalez</ENAMEX> and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the East to the need to speed up changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>. They are stressing that the best way for the West to help the East is to move faster towards <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western European</ENAMEX> economic and monetary unity. This would make the market-oriented system more attractive to Eastern countries, they argue, and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East.</ENAMEX>
``The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> told the European Parliament in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strasbourg</ENAMEX> yesterday, ``is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community.</ENAMEX>'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> allowing a European central bank, and that the treaty be ratified by 1992. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX> also proposed a separate ``Bank for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'' that would channel development money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East.</ENAMEX>
One basis for linking change in the East and change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> is the notion that integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans, despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s obvious strategic and economic interest. Says a European strategist: ``The U.S. tends to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> {not including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>} as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> looks at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>: important but far away. But for us in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, these are Europeans next door.''
A reintegrated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies. There is likely to be a natural division of labor, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Heisbourg</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Institute for Strategic Studies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> more involved with specific aid measures for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East.</ENAMEX>
The designation at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>'s economic summit of major industrialized nations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC Commission</ENAMEX> as coordinator of Western aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> was a first step. In part, this division is dictated by economics: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> is a net exporter of capital while the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> isn't. While American aid efforts have been limited by budget problems, yesterday <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> announced a three-year, four billion French franc ($650 million) aid plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>.
Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation, some Western European leaders, especially British Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Thatcher</ENAMEX>, remain skeptical about European political and economic unity, and are unlikely to let East-West concerns change their minds. But British analysts are beginning to link the issues.
``We need a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Ostpolitik</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Roper</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Institute of International Affairs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East.</ENAMEX> ``For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> we need to think about a stick-and-carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers.'' He notes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Plan</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> ``didn't just throw money at post-war <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, it also liberalized and opened up those markets.''
The French analysis goes further. ``Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>'s leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika {Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s policy of economic restructuring} to succeed,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Vedrine</ENAMEX>, security adviser to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitterrand</ENAMEX>. ``But they haven't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions.''
He adds that with communism collapsing and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> scrambling to rejuvenate the Soviet economy, ``Our interest lies in a controlled transformation, a contained nuclear reaction, so we need to help him, and not just with words.'' Managing change, he adds, will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, especially in dealing with the question of German reunification.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thierry de Montbrial</ENAMEX>, director of the French Institutue for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Relations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, says it isn't clear what, exactly, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> wants. Any push for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> vision of a ``common European home,'' implying the eventual dissolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet-German</ENAMEX> partnership and the withdrawal of U.S. forces, ``would be a very, very serious problem,'' he says. He doubts a Bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, but warns of ``a risk of profound change in the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> that is too strong, even if democratic.''
He adds: ``We, and the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> have to talk to the Germans, now, frankly and raise these future risks with them.''
While many commentators, particularly French ones, worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> or the speeded-up withdrawal of American troops, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> sees a more positive scenario. ``There seems to be a message from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> there's a deal on offer,'' he says. ``They want reassurance we won't try to undermine or destroy the Warsaw Pact.... In return, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> could keep their nuclear weapons. He adds: ``Once both sides feel comfortable, it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East.</ENAMEX>
