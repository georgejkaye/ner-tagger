In the lobby of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette Co.</ENAMEX>'s razor and blade factory, a glass case displays artifacts from shaving over the ages: An Egyptian bronze razor from 1500 B.C., a Turkish crescent razor from 1190, a straight razor from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Franco</ENAMEX> Prussian War in 1870.
Then there is the first safety razor, invented by company founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King C. Gillette</ENAMEX> in 1903, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> Blue Blade (1932), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trac II</ENAMEX> twin-blade razor (1971).
Soon, Sensor, a new razor, will be added to the case. With twin blades mounted on tiny springs so they can move independently -- the better to reach every nook and cranny on your face -- Sensor is being touted as providing the smoothest and closest shave man has ever known. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> believes the new razor will be snapped up by millions.
It better be.
Ten years in the making, Sensor has cost more than $200 million to develop and start manufacturing, and will cost an additional $110 million to advertise it in its first year alone. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX>, still recovering from years of turmoil when it was a repeated target of corporate raiders, is placing the biggest bet in its history on Sensor.
If the new razor is a hit, it will cap the company's recent comeback and vindicate management's defense that its strategies would pay off for shareholders over the long run. If the razor flops, it undoubtedly will renew charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> executives entrenched themselves at the expense of stockholders.
``This is put up or shut up,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Newbury</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Retirement Equities Fund</ENAMEX>, a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> shareholder that voted against management in a bitter proxy fight that narrowly failed to oust four incumbent directors last year.
``If we don't get sizable returns'' on Sensor, concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> vice chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred M. Zeien</ENAMEX>, ``we ought to be criticized for having wasted lots of money.''
To substantially increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX>'s profits, Sensor must perform a marketing miracle: halt a 15-year trend toward inexpensive disposable razors. At double the cost of shaving using disposables, Sensor will be a hard sell.
``Men are strange animals. They find something they like and stick to it,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angela Aguiar</ENAMEX>, a buyer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooks Pharmacy</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> chain. ``It's difficult to get men to change their grooming habits. I've seen a lot of good products go by the wayside or grow slowly because men don't like to change.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> executives would like nothing more than to prove their critics wrong and score a victory for mainstream, corporate America over Wall Street raiders. More than a battle over a company, the fight over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> in some ways epitomized the takeover wars of recent years. Takeover artists offered short-term profits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Management</ENAMEX> promised a bigger long-term payoffif  only shareholders were willing to wait for promising new products.
More than a few are rooting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX>. ``What (raiders) are saying is that any time a stock price is below what we can get for it in frothy takeover market, we're entitled to liquidate the business'' by selling it to the high bidder, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Lowenstein</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Law School</ENAMEX> professor and critic of many takeovers. ``That's not good industrial policy.''
A bit stodgy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> became a takeover target because of sluggish growth in the early and mid-1980s. Though it boasts some of the world's best-known brand names -- among them Foamy shaving cream, Right Guard deodorant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oral B toothbrushes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Papermate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Flair</ENAMEX> pens -- earnings and sales stagnated because of lackluster marketing. Efforts to diversify into such disjointed businesses as computer accessories, eyewear, hearing aids and beauty centers didn't help.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revlon Inc.</ENAMEX> made the first takeover bid in November 1986, but withdrew after being bought off with a $558 million payment for its stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> rebuffed two more overtures from Revlon a year later. In 1988, it fought off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coniston Partners</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investment firm, which had sought to oust four directors and sell the company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revlon</ENAMEX> was trying to buy the company on the cheap, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> insisted then -- and now. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX>'s defense, adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colman Mockler Jr.</ENAMEX>, its unassuming and shy chief executive, the rate of return on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> stock over the past decade has been 24% annually. ``We're in the top 100 of the Fortune 500'' over that period, he notes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> had made huge investments in new products and manufacturing efficiencies that curtailed earnings in the 1980s, but executives expect those investments to pay off in the 1990s. ``I'm not criticizing (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Revlon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald) Perelman</ENAMEX> for perceiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> as an undervalued asset,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeien</ENAMEX>. ``We just said we're not going to let you steal this undervalued asset.''
To the surprise of many on Wall Street, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> has fashioned a turnaround. Energized by its close shave with corporate raiders, it slashed employment 8% and dumped mediocre businesses (taking a $243 million pretax writeoff). It introduced a number of successful new products and increased ad spending. ``Was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> a sleepy company beforehand? Did Perelman trigger change? Yeah,'' concedes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zeien</ENAMEX>. ``But what it didn't do was change the fundamental way we do business.''
The result: 1989 earnings are expected to reach $300 million, up from $181 million (before one-time charges) in 1986, and sales will approach $3.9 billion, up from $2.82 billion three years ago. Its writing-instruments business and Braun electric shaver and small appliance unit -- which some analysts wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> to jettison a few years ago -- are growing robustly. Only its toiletries and cosmetics businesses have remained laggards.
In fact, the company's stock, after dropping to the low $30s not long after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> won the proxy contest and the threat of a takeover diminished, has recovered. Now hovering in the mid $40s, it closed yesterday at $45.875 a share.
Many on Wall Street have climbed on the bandwagon. ``I think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> will ultimately vindicate itself, and there is some evidence that it already has,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Shore</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton.</ENAMEX> And two of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s savviest investors have loaded up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Buffett</ENAMEX> bought $600 million of preferred stock, which is convertible into an 11% stake. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity Investment</ENAMEX> mutual fund guru <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Lynch</ENAMEX> has added to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX>'s holdings of late.
But critics remain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revlon</ENAMEX>'s last offer of $47 a share would have paid off handsomely for shareholders had they taken the money and reinvested it in the market, which has risen 25% this year. ``We aren't too satisfied. They haven't done better than the market,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Arau</ENAMEX>, principal investment officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Public Employees Retirement System</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> holder that supported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coniston</ENAMEX> in its proxy fight. ``It looks as if there's no value added here, so we can't be too happy.''
So, to deliver on their promise to ``maximize shareholder value,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> is gambling on Sensor, which will be announced Tuesday at a bash at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pierre Hotel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stores</ENAMEX> will start selling the razor after an ad blitz that kicks into high gear with commercials during the Super Bowl on Jan. 28.
For all its other businesses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> means one thing to consumers world-wide: shaving. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> dominates the business in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, with a market share of about 64%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Razors</ENAMEX> and blades account for just one-third of its sales -- but two-thirds of profits. ``Nothing is as good as the razor business,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derwin Phillips</ENAMEX>, a vice chairman. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX>'s operating profit margins from razors are 34% compared with 10.3% in all its other businesses combined.
Still, the shaving business hasn't been the same since disposable razors were introduced in the mid-1970s. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disposables</ENAMEX>, once used by relatively few, now are the razors of choice for more than half of all American shavers. But profits on them are thin, because they cost more to make yet sell for less than the cartridges used in permanent razors.
Sensor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> believes, can reverse the trend by providing a better shave. But the big question isn't so much whether Sensor offers a better shave, but whether that matters to customers. The razor market isn't growing, so Sensor will have to win over shavers who use other razors, namely disposables, including its own.
New technology is the key to the Sensor. A man's face may look smooth to the naked eye. But magnified, it resembles the streets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>: there are potholes and bumps all over. ``Current twin edge razors are like a car that doesn't have springs or shock absorbers,'' explains a research and development executive at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX>. ``They hit the whiskers at different points, so they leave different heights of whiskers. In some cases, the blades dig into skin'' and cause irritation.
Sensor addresses this with a novel suspension system that allows the two blades to move separately. Each blade has tiny springs soldered to it. Thus, the blades move up, down and sideways with the contour of the face. Springs are attached to a guard below the twin blades. Because some shavers press too hard and some not hard enough, this feature, ``like automatic transmission, will help to automatically adjust the force,'' the executive says.
The two blades are farther apart, allowing easier cleaning, and the razor has a mechanism making it easier to change cartridges. The head is slightly smaller than that of top-of-the-line <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atra</ENAMEX>, so shavers will have to buy new razors to use Sensor blades.
To test the razor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> has asked a number of employees to come in early every morning and shave at the factory here. Researchers measure their whiskers by mounting a microscopic camera on the razor that calibrates the shadow of the stub; they also collect the cut whiskers and measure them, using a microscope.
A prototype for what became the Sensor razor was first developed in 1979. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> had hoped to introduce the new system in 1984 or 1985, but it couldn't figure out how to mass produce the cartridges. (The long delay raised some  eyebrows in the company. ``It only took five years to fight World War II,'' grouses one marketing executive.)
The biggest obstacle was attaching the springs to the blades on a high-speed assembly line that makes 2 1/2 cartridges a second. No commercial lasers could operate at the speed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> needed to weld the springs to the blades, so the company had to develop its own lasers. A test line in 1986 indicated its technology was feasible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> spent the next two years -- and $150 million -- to build manufacturing equipment for mass production.
Though competitors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schick</ENAMEX> may get to license the technology in the future, they may be hampered because of the high cost and complexity of setting up manufacturing facilities. ``To replicate (Sensor) would be a pretty tough undertaking,'' says one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> source.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> figures that a portion of the profits will come as shavers who use topof-the-line  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atra</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trac II</ENAMEX> razors trade up to Sensor; they obviously are willing to pay a premium for a better shave. Sensor might win customers from rivals like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner-Lambert Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schick</ENAMEX> division, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bic Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swedish Match</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilkinson Sword</ENAMEX> unit. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> already has a huge market share, further gains won't be easy.
So the only way to increase profits substantially is to get users of disposables to switch. Can Sensor do it? A former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> shaving executive is skeptical. He asks: If products such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atra</ENAMEX> already offer a closer shave, yet they haven't wooed a substantial number away from disposables, can Sensor, expecially since its price will be 25% higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atra</ENAMEX>'s?
Yes, insists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W. Symons</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Atlantic shaving group</ENAMEX>, who headed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX>'s European business in the mid-1980s. Upset that disposables were making razors a commodity business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Symons</ENAMEX> mapped a counterattack with cartridge razors. At sales meetings, he would stand up with a disposable in one hand and a metal Atra razor in the other and demand, ``Are you a plastic man or a steel man?'' The strategy is working. In 1988, the unit market share of cartridges in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> had risen to 36% from 33.8% in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emboldened</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillette</ENAMEX> stopped advertising disposables in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Now, it promotes its cartridges as ``the best a man can get.'' In the first six months of this year, cartridges captured 33% of the market, up from an all-time low of 31.7% last year. ``That's the first time share has grown since disposables were launched in the mid-1970s,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Symons</ENAMEX> chortles.
