<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones & Co.</ENAMEX> proposed to acquire the 33% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate Inc.</ENAMEX> it doesn't already own for $18 a share, or about $576 million.
The market apparently expects the two companies to negotiate a higher price. In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> closed at $20.375 a share, up $5.25. It was the most active issue on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>, with more than four million shares changing hands, more than 50 times its average daily volume.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX>, which publishes The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>, has been an investor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>, an electronic financial information and transaction services company, since 1985, when it purchased a 32% interest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> has invested about $911 million so far in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>, at an average cost of about $14.32 a share.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>'s board named two independent directors to consider the proposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>'s 13-member board includes six <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> officers and a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> executive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil S. Hirsch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive officer, declined to comment further.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren H. Phillips</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX>, said that the offer was made ``to integrate the two companies to obtain operational efficiencies and to permit even closer and more efficient working relationships in marketing, customer service and the management of our related businesses. These objectives can best be achieved if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> is wholly owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Skinner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> vice president, corporate general counsel and secretary, said the company probably would finance the offer ``using commercial paper, as we have in the past.'' He declined to comment on the market premium for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> shares over the $18 offer. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> projects that the acquisition would dilute earnings about seven cents a share in 1990 ``and contribute to earnings thereafter.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> is prepared to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> and its advisers to discuss the proposal and considerations made in setting the price, which he described as ``full and fair.'' Separately, a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> shareholders said they filed suit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delaware</ENAMEX> Chancery court asserting the proposed offer is inadequate. The suit described the offer as a ``freeze-out'' that will deny public shareholders ``their right to share proportionately in the true value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>'s valuable and profitable businesses, and future growth in profits and earnings.'' The suit also said the $18 price wasn't based on any ``independent appraisal'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>'s value, but was ``fixed arbitrarily.'' The suit seeks to have the offer enjoined, or set aside if it is consummated, and seeks unspecified damages. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> said he hadn't seen the papers and couldn't comment on the suit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> said it will begin a cash tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> shares at $18 a share early next week. The offer and withdrawal rights are to expire Nov. 3. If, as a result of the offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> owns 90% or more of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>'s shares, or if the two companies reach an acquisition agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> will acquire the remaining shares in a merger at the same price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> also publishes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barron</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX> and other periodicals, electronic business information services and community newspapers. In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> shares closed at $37.125, down 37.5 cents.
The offer comes at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>'s earnings are under some pressure due to costs related to the start-up of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trading Service</ENAMEX> operation, jointly developed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> The service is a computer-based foreign exchange trading system. In its second-quarter report, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> said that the costs would continue to hurt earnings through 1989 but that the service shows ``great promise.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX>'s earnings and sales growth have slowed after a rapid pace in recent years. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company currently expects to report per-share earnings ``in the low 90 cent'' area for the year; for 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> earned $91.2 million, or 96 cents a share, a 21% increase, on a 31% revenue gain to $440 million. But earnings fell 12% in last year's fourth quarter; 8.4% in the first quarter; and 6.4% in the latest second quarter.
Analysts generally greeted the move as a favorable one for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX>, although some speculated that the company may come under pressure to sweeten the bid to $20 a share or more.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> clearly didn't offer much of a premium to the current stock price,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drew Marcus</ENAMEX>, a media anlayst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcus</ENAMEX> added that the company has taken a ``slow, deliberate approach, and my feeling is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> won't chase the stock.'' If the company doesn't succeed in its current bid, he said, it ``would probably retreat and continue a slow accumulation.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Thorp</ENAMEX>, a media analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNC Financial Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Provident National Bank</ENAMEX>, noted that although the market activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> stock yesterday seemed to signal that arbitragers expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> to sweeten its bid, the company appears to be under no real pressure to do so. ``The stock is trading a little above where it would be reasonable to expect a deal,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thorp</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Wallach</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX>, said the combination will be a ``strong No. 2 in the highest value added segments'' of the information services business, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters PLC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Morton</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch, Jones & Ryan</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> ``is a rapidly growing business and it's a good thing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> to own all of it.'' Despite a slowdown in earnings growth at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> recently, ``longer term it is a good investment because this is the wave of information future, and the bigger presence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> has, the better,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX> said.
