Call it a failed attempt at Chinese-style glasnost.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo Standing Committee</ENAMEX>, formed after the June suppression of the pro-democracy protests, met the press yesterday for the first time. The six members strode in flashing smiles and wearing well-cut Western suits, clearly hoping to soften their image in a culture attuned to political symbols.
But the glasnost stopped when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang Zemin</ENAMEX> and his five party stalwarts took on questions. This wasn't the time to indicate an easing of the repression that has gripped <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> since the massacre of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of civilians in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tiananmen Square</ENAMEX>. Instead, it was pure party line. Said a Chinese intellectual who witnessed the event on television: ``It was like my weekly political study class, except not nearly as interesting.''
For Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX>, the 62-year-old former mayor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX>, the news conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in the Great Hall of the People was something of a national coming out. He tried to appear relaxed, though several attempts at humor fell flat. Taking his seat at the podium, he looked at the crowd and said, in English, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hello.</ENAMEX>'' No one responded, leaving an awkward silence. It was a marked contrast to the smooth handling of the media by his now-ousted predecessor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao Ziyang</ENAMEX>.
Dealing with the press was probably a minor irritant for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> compared with the struggle to live up to his role as the new heir-apparent of senior leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> has to contend with the reality that real power resides not with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo Standing Committee</ENAMEX>, but with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX> and a group of revolutionary octogenaraians, which some Western diplomats refer to cynically as ``the sitting committee.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX>'s previously designated successors, party chiefs Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu Yaobang</ENAMEX>, both were sacked. Their mistakes included being too soft on ``bourgeois liberalism,'' a catchword to describe Western influences the party doesn't like.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> hinted the 85-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng</ENAMEX>, whose health fluctuates, isn't ready to relinquish his last remaining post, the military chairmanship. As for the previous heir-designate, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX>, who was ousted as head of the party June 24, he said only that the party's investigation into his mistakes is continuing. That leaves open the possibility Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX> -- who is accused of supporting the ``turmoil'' and splitting the party -- will face criminal charges.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> did, however, suggest that his predecessor isn't under arrest. ``Because he has a longer record in serving the party, I think he enjoys better treatment in life than I do,'' he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> watchers looking for signs of a softening line came up short. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> was asked about the discrepancy between two descriptions used by Chinese leaders of the student-led democracy movement. One is ``counter-revolutionary rebellion,'' a grave criminal charge in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>; the other is the more neutral phrase ``turmoil.'' He replied: ``We definitely can say that it was a counter-revolutionary rebellion.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> gave no indication the tide of repression, arrests and executions will subside, despite condemnation overseas. He declined to rule out the possibility captured dissident students and intellectuals will be executed. And he dismissed a foreign reporter's query about the arrest and mistreatment of one unidentified student by saying: ``I've heard many examples that sound like fairy tales from the Arabian Nights.''
On economic issues, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiang</ENAMEX> and the other leaders stressed that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> would proceed with its policies of reform and opening to the outside world. But when it came to details, there were signs only of continuing retrenchment, not market-oriented liberalization.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standing Committee</ENAMEX> member Yao <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yilin</ENAMEX>, who heads state planning, suggested that private enterprises may be squeezed. In recent weeks, the official media have said such businesses will be forced merely to pay their fair share of taxes. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yao</ENAMEX>, apparently reading from a prepared text, hinted at broad sanctions. ``We will put appropriate restrictions on their negative role in the national economy,'' he said.
