The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has removed an obstacle in the way of achieving a superpower agreement to reduce long-range nuclear missiles. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s proposal will make it politically tougher for the U.S. to deploy a space-based defense system.
In a weekend meeting here between Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Baker</ENAMEX> and Soviet Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eduard Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>, the Soviets proposed that they would no longer link progress toward achieving a strategic-arms reduction treaty to progress in separate talks involving space-based weapons. However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> said that even if an arms-reduction pact is signed, the Soviets would withdraw from it if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s view, violated restrictions on space-weapons development.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, fearing U.S. technological prowess, has opposed the development of space-based defensive weapons since former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> proposed his controversial ``Star Wars'' system more than six years ago.
The two nations also said there would be a summit between President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> in the late spring or early summer, and reached agreement or made substantial progress on other issues, ranging from verification of underground nuclear testing to moving toward eliminating chemical weapons.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> will offer a new initiative on a chemical-weapons ban when he addresses the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> today.
In proposing the delinking of talks on long-range missile and space-defense weapons, the Soviets may be making a shrewd reading of the U.S. political scene. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has been less enthusiastic than his predecessor about deploying a full-fledged Star Wars system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has resisted Star Wars, technology hasn't developed to the point where deployment soon is feasible and U.S. budget austerity rules out a massive effort.
Under such conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> may be betting that if the two sides can agree to a long-range missile pact, the threat of losing it would generate sufficient pressure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> to limit Star Wars development and even spur a space-systems accord.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX> Adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX>, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>'s ``Meet the Press,'' said a long-range nuclear-weapons agreement could be struck in time for the summit and that the time frame was set with that possibility in mind.
On another issue, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said he was assured the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> isn't planning a crackdown on unrest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic States</ENAMEX>, which are pushing for greater freedom. The Soviet official ``specifically rejected the use of force as not being a feasible alternative, and he says that's a view that is shared by the Soviet leadership,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> said yesterday on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX>'s ``Face the Nation.
