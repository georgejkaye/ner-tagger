<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aflatoxin</ENAMEX>, the fungus-produced poison that contaminated much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corn Belt</ENAMEX> last year, is being detected in newly harvested corn in parts of western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>.
Although the scope of the outbreak is much less than last year, when it was found in several states in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plains</ENAMEX>, its recurrence signals that aflatoxin might be more of a chronic problem in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> than commonly thought.
The outbreak, although isolated, is also rekindling fears in the grain trade that the reputation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> corn is eroding among major foreign buyers, some of whom have been willing to pay a premium in the past for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> corn over other world sources, in part because of the traditional aflatoxin-free billing of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> corn.
Indeed, some traders are speculating that foreign buyers have delayed purchases of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> corn for the past several weeks in order to avoid any chance of getting the last remnants of the tainted 1988 crop, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel W. Basse</ENAMEX>, director of market research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agresource Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. The fungus that produces aflatoxin can continue to excrete the poison in poorly stored corn.
In addition to sluggish export demand, the impending harvest, which will rebuild <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> stockpiles, is keeping corn futures prices in the doldrums. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> yesterday, the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 0.75 cent and settled at $2.2975 a bushel.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aflatoxin</ENAMEX>, a potent carcinogen in some laboratory animals, is excreted by a fungus that flourishes in hot, dry climates. Some scientists suspect aflatoxin is at least partly to blame for high rates of liver cancer in humans in some regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, where aflatoxin contamination of food is common. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aflatoxin</ENAMEX>, which occasionally infests the corn and peanut crops in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast</ENAMEX>, was thought to be a fluke in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> until last year's outbreak, which was the third in 12 years.
Because of spotty drought conditions earlier this summer in much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, crop scientists had expected aflatoxin to show up in scattered areas this fall. Widespread rains in late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX> and August appear to have prevented contamination on last year's scale.
The effects of the 1989 outbreak won't be clear for several weeks. The corn harvest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> has barely started and aflatoxin is difficult to accurately survey -- last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX> authorities didn't grasp the size of the outbreak until the harvest was nearly complete.
According to crop scientists and grain analysts, some elevators in about six <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> counties between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi River</ENAMEX> cities of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moline</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quincy</ENAMEX> are detecting aflatoxin in newly harvested corn offered for sale by local farmers. Many elevators are refusing to buy corn that contains more than 20 parts of aflatoxin per billion, the level considered unsafe for human consumption by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walker Kirby</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> plant pathologist, said much of the newly harvested corn crop in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> counties contains aflatoxin. Testing indicates that most of the contamination, however, is at levels that federal regulators consider safe for consumption by livestock.
Officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX> said yesterday that too little corn has been harvested in the state to determine whether aflatoxin is a problem this year. ``We expect it to be spotty,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Bruns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Muscatine County</ENAMEX> extension agricultural adviser. ``We are keeping our fingers crossed.''
Because of concerns about aflatoxin in stored corn, as well as the possibility that it is in the new crop, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX> regulators are continuing to test milk for contamination and are mulling whether to begin routinely testing processed corn products, such as corn meal, for aflatoxin.
In the past year, dairy farms in several states had to dump milk after unintentionally feeding contaminated corn to cows. In recent weeks, inspectors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX> have detected traces of aflatoxin in some milk samples at levels considered safe for consumption.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
PRECIOUS METALS: Most futures prices turned easier, despite a further drop in the dollar. Gold for December delivery ended with a loss of $1.50 an ounce at $373.10, while December silver was off two cents an ounce and ended at $5.355. October platinum ran counter to the trend, extending Monday's strong advances with a gain of $2.80 an ounce at $490.90. However, this ending price was well below platinum's high for the day of $495.50. Traditionally, gold has tended to rise when the dollar has declined, but, currently, the metal isn't getting help from the cash market for bullion, which remains quiet, according to one analyst. One reason is concern that producers will sell gold on a rally, stifling the advance, the analyst said. Another reason is the question of what the dollar will do, he said. Traders were reminded of the dominant influence of the dollar on gold despite the lack of upward reaction by gold on the dollar's decline Monday and early yesterday. Late in the day, the dollar showed signs of slowing its decline and possibly leveling off. ``Precious metals instantly went on the defensive and sold off from best levels,'' he said.
COFFEE: Futures prices held in a narrow range as traders awaited developments from coffee talks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. The December contract ended with a gain of 0.71 cent a pound at 81.91 cents. Analysts, traders and coffee industry executives aren't expecting any startling developments from the two week-long meeting of the Council of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Coffee Organization</ENAMEX> that began Monday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. Neither are they anticipating any big developments from the meeting between President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colombian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virgilio Barco</ENAMEX> tomorrow in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, traders remained nervous and very sensitive to any news, according to analysts and trade sources. As a result, prices moved very little. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> was expected to submit a proposal that would be the basis for the restoration of export quotas on green coffee shipments from producing countries. According to one dealer, attempts to restore quotas would fail until sales of coffee to countries that aren't members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Coffee Agreement</ENAMEX> at cheaper prices are eliminated and export quotas are made more flexible to allow more shipments of mild coffees. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, the two presidents are expected to dwell on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>'s fight on the narcotics trade, which has become economically associated with the severe drop in coffee prices. The loss of coffee income is hampering the fight against drugs, the Colombian president said in a letter to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>.
COPPER: Prices eased for the fourth consecutive day. The December contract was off 3.10 cents a pound to $1.1970. There were no new fundamental developments to influence prices, according to one analyst. Active selling against the spot, or cash, position on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Metals Exchange</ENAMEX> weakened prices in that market and set the tone for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading, the analyst said. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> December contract fell below $1.20, selling orders that had been placed around that level were triggered and caused the price to fall further, he said. However, when December hit its low for the day at $1.1890, which was below the previous low of $1.19 set on Sept. 11, renewed demand developed, helping prices to recover slightly. Another analyst observed that the weakness was a continuation of the selling influenced by a higher-than-expected increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> stocks reported Monday. Another rise is anticipated next Monday, the analyst said. A third analyst said that, in addition, there has been an increase in inventories of copper held by producers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and overseas, which also helped depress prices.
