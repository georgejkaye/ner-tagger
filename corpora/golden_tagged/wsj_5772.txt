The battle lines were drawn when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.</ENAMEX> blasted Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX>, in full-page newspaper ads, ``for creating a climate of fear and distrust within the entire generic pharmaceutical industry.''
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> Democrat, has been leading a House subcommittee probe of questionable practices by generic-drug companies. As part of that inquiry, he prodded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> into investigating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Copiague</ENAMEX>, a tiny company by Wall Street standards but flagship of the public generic-drug companies.
The ads this month in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> Today and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newsday</ENAMEX> angered subcommittee members who saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s highly unusual tactic as an effort to cow congressional investigators. But others familar with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> say the company acted out of frustration, concerned that its credibility was being unfairly assailed.
``We're caught in the middle of a big power play,'' asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Shulman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s co-founder, who contends the company has become a pawn in a political fight between Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>.
With his open shirt, jeans and jogging shoes, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> looks more like one of his pill-factory workers than president of the company. While he has run in five <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> marathons, 55-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> now faces his biggest challenge: successfully defending the integrity of the company and its products.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> has not only triggered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s review of approvals granted, but surveillance of industry manufacturing practices. Congressional investigators believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> may have gained approval in 1987 of a big-selling generic version of the blood pressure drug called Dyazide by passing off the brand-name drug as its own, and pressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> to investigate. That was more than two months ago, and while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> inquiry drags on, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s reputation has been deeply tarnished. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> is threatening to withdraw its approval of the company's generic version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyazide</ENAMEX>, a move that could cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> as much as 40% of about $130 million in annual sales.
It could also lead to higher consumer costs, because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s is the only inexpensive version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyazide</ENAMEX>, sold widely as a brand name product by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithkline Beecham PLC</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hemant Shah</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warren</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX> drug analyst, charges that ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s unfairly twisting in the wind. {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank} Young</ENAMEX> is trying to deliver bodies to Dingell to save his job.'' Still, he says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s generic Dyazide sales haven't been significantly hurt.
A spokesman for Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> declined to comment about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>. ``There isn't any point in commenting until the facts are known,'' he said. ``The only concern is that the facts be known.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> has yet to rule on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> committed fraud in its approval application. Generic-industry officials believe the ruling hasn't been made because of an internal FDA rift between officials who want to placate Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> and others who believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> did nothing wrong. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s stock has plummeted, though it made a partial recovery in recent days in heavy trading, closing at $21.75 up $1.125, after gaining 75 cents on Friday.
One indication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> dispute is the conflicting positions of agency officials. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> has said he wants to strip <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> of its approval for generic Dyazide, one of the agency's top scientists, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Peck</ENAMEX>, has stated publicly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s generic blood-pressure medicine is safe and effective.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> contends that questions about generic Dyazide and the approval application for an anti-psychotic medicine were resolved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s satisfaction years ago.
``I see it as a fight between the FDA scientific types and Young,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Haddad</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schein Pharmaceutical Inc.</ENAMEX>, of Port <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, which receives 50% of the profits from sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s generic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dyazide</ENAMEX> as part of a marketing arrangement.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> says he doesn't intend to pull the blood-pressure medicine off the market. The battle over the drug, he acknowledges, could drag out for a year or more. During that time he predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> will prove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s product is equivalent to the Dyazide manufactured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithkline</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. ``Eventually our Dyazide will be cleared,'' he says.
But an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> official's testimony before the Dingell subcommittee last week severely damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s credibility. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Vogel</ENAMEX>, deputy compliance director, suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> tried to pass off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandoz Phamaceuticals Co.</ENAMEX> anti-psychotic drug as its own in laboratory testing in 1982.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolar</ENAMEX> was trying to be sneaky, it muffed the job. The faint outline of the distinctive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandoz</ENAMEX> logo can be seen on the pills originally submitted to the testing laboratory. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bolar</ENAMEX> eventually resubmitted different pills and won FDA approval.) Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> insists that the problem occured when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> tried to match the color of its pills with those of brand-name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandoz</ENAMEX>'s and mixed up the pills of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sandoz</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX>'s. He says if Bolar really wanted to cheat, it could have completely removed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandoz</ENAMEX> logo from the brand name pills and recoated them without a logo. ``Nobody would try to wipe a logo off {a brand-name product},'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> said. Nonetheless, he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolar</ENAMEX> plans an internal investigation into the incident.
Yet Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shulman</ENAMEX> says that his lack of political savvy probably has damaged the company. In retrospect, he says, the newspaper ads ``may have been a mistake,'' because they raised the ire of congressional investigators.
