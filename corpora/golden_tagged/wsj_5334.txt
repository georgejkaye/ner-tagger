<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc S.A.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s largest chemical and drug company, continued its expansion into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market by agreeing to pay about $1.3 billion for two acquisitions: a specialty chemical unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF Corp.</ENAMEX> and the chemical subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ Corp.</ENAMEX> The proposed sales aren't linked but were announced together.
Both units operate heavily in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> said the effect would be to increase its U.S. sales nearly 50% to more than $2 billion on an annual basis. The state-owned French company said U.S. sales now will account for nearly 20% of its business, up from 13% before the acquisitions.
In 1986, only 3% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>'s sales were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and the expansion across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> has been one of the company's main goals since then. Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Rene Fourtou</ENAMEX> implied that the expansion is likely to continue later, saying at one point that this marks just a ``momentary'' conclusion to his acquisitions.
Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> unit does almost as much business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>'s British business also will mount, to 8% of total sales from 4% before the acquisitions.
French chemical companies, almost all of which are state-controlled, are under government pressure to grow rapidly now to face mounting competition as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> prepares to reduce internal trade barriers in 1992. In a few months, the government is expected to broadly reorganize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s chemical business, merging companies into two or three main groups, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> as one of the major poles. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fourtou</ENAMEX> insisted that the restructuring plans hadn't played a role in his decision.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Curiously</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> disagreed on the price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> is paying for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> subsidiary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> announced a price of # 568 million ($892.6 million), including # 56 million ($88 million) of debt to be assumed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>. Based on last year's earnings, it said that left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> paying a price 24 times the unit's after-tax profit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>, however, said the true price is the # 512 million it will pay in cash. It said the debt shouldn't be considered part of the price. And it said the price-earnings ratio should be 12 rather than 24, because it should be calculated on expected pretax operating earnings for this year, rather than last year's actual net, which was affected by other operations within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> group.
The controversy drew chuckles from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> analysts, who said each side was exaggerating the benefits it was getting. Regardless of the dispute, the analysts said both sides seemed likely to benefit from the sale.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> built up its non-mining business in the early 1980s, when the mining outlook seemed bleak, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Read</ENAMEX>, director of mining research for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith New Court PLC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. With the mining business looking promising again, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> has shed the non-mining units -- oil and gas, cement and now chemicals -- at a profit, he said.
The sale helps replenish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX>'s warchest, and some analysts thought it could set the stage for the acquisitive mining giant to resume hunting for new purchases. Though a fast-growing business, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ Chemicals</ENAMEX> went on the auction block this year partly to help pay for one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX>'s biggest-ever buys: This year's $4.4 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX>'s minerals division. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> now claims to be the world's largest mining company.
``I think this is an excellent deal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Glen</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> office, who noted that the opportunity to buy specialty chemical companies is dwindling as more and more are acquired. ``There are a lot of other chemical companies out there trying to do the same thing, and they aren't doing as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc.</ENAMEX>''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fourtou</ENAMEX> acknowledged, however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> unit had been ``expensive'' at $480 million. He said that was because its performance already is excellent. ``It has an excellent management team, and we think they will want to stay with us,'' he said. He said he expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> unit to record $190 million in sales this year, at two plants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> went private this year in a buy-out led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> executives, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fourtou</ENAMEX> said the sale was part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX>'s effort to repay debt incurred by the buy-out.
He said he considered the RTZ price, on the other hand, ``the cheapest such purchase in years,'' because even by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX>'s calculations the price was less than the unit's projected sales for this year of # 580 million. The reason for that, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fourtou</ENAMEX> said, is that the unit is restructuring and closing factories. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> would carry out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX>'s planned cutbacks. Last year's sales at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> chemical unit were # 450 million, he said, but acquisitions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> since then have increased the unit's size. The acquisitions are the latest in a string of companies active in the U.S. that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> has bought since 1986. Among the major purchases have been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Carbide Corp.</ENAMEX>'s agro-chemicals activities, two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX> subsidiaries and a basic chemicals unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stauffer Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>
The two chemical units that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX> agreed to purchase both specialize in chemicals that enhance the performance of other substances, such as paints, cosmetics or herbicides. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAF</ENAMEX> unit is almost entirely in this ``performance chemical'' business, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTZ</ENAMEX> unit is 52% in it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhone-Poulenc</ENAMEX>, already strong in basic chemicals and in drugs, has been eager to extend into this higher added-value realm.
