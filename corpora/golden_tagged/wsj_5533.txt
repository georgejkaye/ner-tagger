TAKEOVER EXPENSES create deduction confusion even for the
It has revoked private ruling 8927005, which let an unidentified company deduct legal, investment-banking, and other costs of defeating a hostile bid and negotiating a merger into a ``white knight.'' On the ruling's heels came <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Court</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clapp</ENAMEX>'s opinion barring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Starch</ENAMEX> from deducting as current expenses $2.9 million of such costs in its friendly 1978 takeover by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX>. He agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> that the costs must be capitalized, but rejected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s reasoning and developed his own.
Tax experts have been debating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clapp</ENAMEX>'s reasoning, whether it clashes with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> ruling, and whether the two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> positions were inconsistent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> told the subject of the private ruling, a Peat Marwick client, of the revocation. ``Apparently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> decided that it was more lenient in the ruling than its litigators were in court and that {the debates} indicate the two cases weren't reconcilable,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert Bloom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peat</ENAMEX>. ``We think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Starch</ENAMEX> was a poor decision, at least intellectually.''
``We also think there will be more litigation on this issue,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> adds. ``There are a lot of bucks at stake.''
IN GOLD WE TRUST, and for trusts we deduct, says a self-published author.
As ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Zolo</ENAMEX>,'' engineer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gustavo Garcia</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hacienda Heights</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, wrote ``Legion of Roots,'' a Western novel with clues to the hiding places of gold coins ``worth $30,000.'' They really were worth $500; but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> put $30,000 in a revocable trust, to be paid if one coin is found and presented to the publisher, which Garcia controls. He deducted $30,000 as a 1981 business-promotion cost, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> denied the deduction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> appealed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tax Court</ENAMEX>, but Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drennen</ENAMEX> has rejected the deduction: As both trustee and publisher, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> never lost control of the trust or the funds and in effect ``never parted with the $30,000.'' His liability to pay the $30,000 won't be irrevocably established until someone finds and presents the hidden coin for payment -- and book sales have been so low that royalty income has totaled only $146.94.
LATE-BREAKING CHANGES in the law may disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> return-printing schedules. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is debating proposed cuts in capital-gains and Medicare-catastrophic-care taxes for 1989 and other legislation just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> needs to send 1989 forms to 57 contract printers around the U.S. Forms are meant to reach post offices late in November and taxpayers a month after. Laws have been passed late in a year before, but it's unusual to have changes affecting so many taxpayers in the enactment year, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Murphy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> public-affairs chief.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> expects over 108 million personal 1989 returns; about 10 million are affected by the Medicare tax and 12 million to 15 million by capital gains, with some overlapping. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> is holding back return packages with forms related to those issues until it decides how to cope with possible changes; it has sent to printers five types of packages for taxpayers unaffected by the issues. It can't say how much any changes may add to printing costs and postage.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> budgeted $57 million for printing the 1989 returns and $63 million for mailing and other distribution.
STARTING <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT THE TOP</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldberg</ENAMEX>, who recently left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Skadden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arps</ENAMEX>, Slate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meagher & Flom</ENAMEX> to take that job, notes that his new salary, $82,500, may be less than that of a 1989 law-school grad at his former firm. The firm says starting pay will be in a range of $81,000 to $83,000. The top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> counsel gets $78,600.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WOODSTOCK SOUVENIRS</ENAMEX> for 13 vendors of beads, T-shirts, and such keepsakes at the 20th-anniversary nostalgia trip last month include summonses alleging failure to comply with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> sales-tax law. Arrest warrants were issued Monday for three who didn't make a first court appearance.
REQUESTS TO EXTEND the due date for 1988 returns to Oct. 16 were filed on Form 2688, which doesn't include a line for a return-preparer's address. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CPA David L. Zalles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bala Cynwyd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, urges taxpayers to forward replies from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> to their preparers as quickly as possible.
HIS'N' HERS tax accounts could resolve a lot of spousal miscues.
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>, that is. With a new computer project called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLE</ENAMEX> (don't ask why), it hopes to cure a major failing -- its inability to do immediate checks of names and Social Security numbers on returns and other papers to spot mismatches with its account records. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corrections</ENAMEX> could be made as returns arrive, a test in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memphis Service Center</ENAMEX> shows; the present manual paper-shuffling takes three to six weeks. OLE can provide rapid access to accounts for other purposes, too.
Taxpayer errors cause many mismatches, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLE</ENAMEX> also is designed to end a problem caused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>'s filing of joint-return accounts under just one Social Security number. That creates no end of confusion when a couple marry, divorce, file separately, or merely reverse the order of the numbers on their return. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLE</ENAMEX> introduces the expedient of automatic cross-referencing of spouses' and former spouses' numbers.
The 1989 returns will take a step to facilitate this by putting spouses' names and numbers on separate lines.
BRIEFS: After nearly 30 years of negotiation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX> signed an income-tax treaty, subject to ratification by both.... The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> plans a hearing Nov. 17 on its proposed rules defining excess ``golden-parachute'' severance payments that aren't deductible by employers.
