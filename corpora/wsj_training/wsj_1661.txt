Hit by higher costs and lower sales, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caterpillar Inc.</ENAMEX> said third-quarter earnings tumbled 43% and full-year earnings will trail last year's results.
The construction equipment maker said third-quarter profit fell to $108 million, or $1.07 a share, from $190 million, or $1.87 a share, a year earlier. Sales dropped 6% to $2.58 billion from $2.74 billion, reflecting eight fewer business days in the latest quarter.
