<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dravo Corp.</ENAMEX> said it filed a $147 million claim against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, because the city has rejected a waste-to-energy plant built by the natural-resources company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dravo</ENAMEX> said the three-boiler plant was completed in December, and improvements in the facility have been made. The plant currently operates fully.
Earlier this month, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Beach</ENAMEX> rejected the plant, saying it didn't meet its specifications.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dravo</ENAMEX> said the city's failure to accept the plant wouldn't affect the company's reserves for discontinued operations.
