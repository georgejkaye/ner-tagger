The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, in a stunning victory for President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, agreed to cut the tax on capital gains, soundly rejecting an alternative proposed by Democratic leaders.
After weeks of intense lobbying by both sides, the leadership's plan was defeated by a larger-than-expected 239-190 vote. The convincing margin increases the likelihood that a capital gains cut of some sort could become law this year.
The vote was a blow to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>'s newly elected Democratic leadership, particularly Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Foley</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gephardt</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>. Both had put their personal prestige on the line to defeat the tax-cut measure, which represented their first major showdown with the Bush administration.
Still, fully one-quarter of their membership -- 64 Democrats -- deserted them and sided with a near-solid phalanx of Republicans. Only one Republican, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Bereuter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nebraska</ENAMEX>, broke ranks and voted, against the wishes of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, for the Democratic alternative.
``This was a watershed for us,'' glowed House Republican Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Michel</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX>.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said the tax cut will help ``make us more successful in the increasingly competitive international marketplace, creating more jobs and better living standards for Americans.'' He pledged to begin ``working cooperatively with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> to give swift attention to this tax cut.''
Last night, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> (D.,<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>), chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Finance Committee</ENAMEX>, began floating a proposal to raise more than $5.4 billion in taxes for fiscal 1990 without resorting to a cut in the capital gains tax or an increase in the top individual tax rate. The proposal also would broaden tax benefits for individual retirement accounts.
The capital gains provision approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> would reduce the tax rate for 2 1/2 years to 19.6%; it currently is as high as 33%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afterward</ENAMEX>, the rate would be set at 28% and the gains from newly acquired assets would be indexed to inflation. The provision is part of a much larger bill that cuts spending and raises taxes, and could clear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> as early as next week. Yesterday's vote against the Democrats' proposal was the only direct test of sentiment on capital gains.
The Democrats' plan would have increased the top tax rate on the nation's wealthiest citizens and expanded the deduction for individual retirement accounts. The Democrats reasoned that the proposal would give a tax break to mostly middle-income people at the expense of the most well-off. They tried to paint the capital gains cut as a giveaway to the rich.
But the message was muddled by the fact that their plan raised substantial amounts of revenue -- $25 billion over five years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicans</ENAMEX> battered the Democrats for proposing a tax increase in the face of a veto threat by the president. The Republicans' House campaign committee vowed to use a vote for the ``tax hike'' against incumbent Democrats in the 1990 elections.
Proponents of the capital gains cut claimed that the tax change would spur economic growth and also increase government receipts. ``It's indeed a tax reduction and a revenue raiser,'' Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX> said. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Vander Jagt</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>) called it ``almost too good to be true,'' and the Democrats heartily agreed. They emphasized that though the provision would raise revenue in the short run because of an increase in asset sales, over the long haul it would cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> billions of dollars.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lehman</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>) called the capital gains cut ``a fraud'' that fit well with ``the spend-now pay-later orgy that epitomized the 1980s.'' And because 80% of the cut's benefit would go to individuals who earn more than $100,000 a year, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marty Russo</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>) labeled it ``disgusting greed.''
In defense of the cut, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX> said, ``The Democratic leadership believes in redistributing the wealth. The bipartisan coalition believes in creating wealth.'' He decried the ``rancid rhetoric of class warfare'' being used against a proposal that he said would mean ``more growth, more jobs, and help us all be more competitive in an increasingly competitive world.''
The debate on the merits was only part of the process. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Partisanship</ENAMEX> and parochial politics also played major roles. Pressure was applied from all quarters. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> made numerous telephone calls to wavering lawmakers from both parties, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> aides met with many of them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> during the week. Democratic leaders delivered thinly veiled warnings to fearful freshmen about committee assignments, and Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> made many personal appeals to win support on this early and important vote.
In the end, Southern conservatives abandoned the leadership in droves; a majority of the Democrats in seven border and Southern states voted against the leadership package. The Democrats in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> were evenly split. In addition, the chairmen of five committees voted against the leadership, including Appropriations Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Judiciary</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Brooks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and Public Works Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Anderson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>. The chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Democrats' fundraising committee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beryl Anthony</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, also sided with the president.
The next stop for the capital gains proposal is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, where Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>) and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> hope to block the cut. They are meeting resistance in their own ranks, however. Some 10 to 15 Democratic senators have been quietly discussing their united view that a capital gains reduction of some sort is a good idea. Meetings with the leadership are being planned in the hopes of working out a compromise position.
``This {the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> vote} is going to put tremendous pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> for passage of capital gains,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Gray</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, the third-ranking Democrat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>. ``I wouldn't be surprised if we get both'' a cut in the capital gains tax and an expansion of IRA tax benefits.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX>'s proposal, with the exception of capital gains, in many ways echoes the one approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX>. It, too, would extend various soon-to-expire tax breaks, though only for one year. It would repeal a nondiscrimination law, called Section 89, dealing with health fringe benefits. Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ways and Means</ENAMEX> proposal, it includes a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bentsen</ENAMEX> plan that, starting in 1991, would give a 50% deduction for IRA contributions to those who don't currently qualify, and, starting next year, would allow withdrawal without penalty for retirement, a first-home purchase and higher education.
The proposal also would repeal a 50% exclusion on interest on bank loans for making stock purchases for employee stock ownership plans, repeal an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes, impose a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals, and put limits on refunds to companies that are involved in leveraged buy-outs. It wouldn't end a tax subsidy to big banks that encourages them to lend to developing nations, and would begin a speedup of the collection of payroll taxes from big companies starting next August.
Other items include a small increase in the international air passenger departure tax, a new $3-a-passenger tax on international departures by commercial ships, and the speedup in the collection of gasoline excise taxes.
In an interview, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> said he hasn't made any final decisions. Some senators are lobbying him to include a capital gains component. He plans to meet with Democratic members of his committee today, and begin drafting sessions next week.
Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> plan approved yesterday, individuals initially could exclude from income 30% of any gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than one year. The exclusion works out to a maximum tax rate of 19.6%. Nearly all capital assets would be covered, including securities, commercial and residential real estate and timber. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collectibles</ENAMEX>, such as artwork and antiques, wouldn't be covered, however.
As written, the exclusion would apply to assets sold from Sept. 14, 1989, through Dec. 31, 1991. But the effective dates could change as the legislation moves through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
Starting in 1992, the maximum effective rate would jump to 28%. But for assets acquired after Dec. 31, 1991, and held for more than a year, individuals could exclude from taxation any gain attributable to inflation.
According to congressional estimates, the capital gains tax reduction would raise $2.9 billion in government revenue in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1990, and would raise $3.8 billion in fiscal 1991 and $2.7 billion in fiscal 1992. That's because the lower tax is expected to increase the turnover of assets, particularly in light of the subsequent rise to 28%.
But starting in fiscal 1993, the plan would lose revenue, compared with current law. In fiscal 1993 it would cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> $5.7 billion and in fiscal 1994 $5.2 billion. Over the five years, the capital gains tax reduction would cost the government $1.5 billion. Over 10 years it would cost $21 billion.
