Ironically, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>' attempt to lead industry prices higher was reported in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry (Sept. 20). You quote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American's</ENAMEX> parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX>, as having said that discount deals for big customers would be ``dumb'' because ``you will go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> because you have to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX> whether the fare is $175, $275 or $375.''
Even if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> is correct, he of all people must realize our society relies on competition to keep prices at a competitive level. In 1986, he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s president that they both raise fares 20%. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> declined). When I asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> for its side of the story for use in my MBA class, where I teach business ethics, it did not respond. Perhaps the ethics of an industry's leader filters down and is one of the factors that ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry.
