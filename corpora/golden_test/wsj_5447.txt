A group including New York-based Steinhardt Partners said it raised its stake in Usair Group Inc. to 8.38% of the common shares outstanding.
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it holds 3,676,400 Usair common shares, including 460,600 bought from Sept. 7 to Sept. 18 for $45.598 to $48.476 apiece.
Earlier this month, the group disclosed it had boosted its stake in Usair to 7.33%. In July, the group said it may consider seeking control of Usair, but had no plans then to do so.
In New York, Gary Fragin, a Steinhardt general partner, said he had no further comment on the filing.
Usair also didn't have a comment.
The move follows an announcement last month that Usair sold the equivalent of a 12% stake to Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which is controlled by Omaha, Neb., investor Warren E. Buffett, to ward off unwanted suitors.
In a separate filing, Mr. Buffett said he has received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to exercise his voting rights on his convertible preferred shares pursuant to an agreement between Berkshire Hathaway and Usair.
