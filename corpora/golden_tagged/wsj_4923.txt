Losses caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurrican Hugo</ENAMEX>, which battered the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX> and a string of islands in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, could add up to the biggest claims bill the insurance industry has ever faced.
Insurance adjusters and brokers estimated the damage at about $1 billion in the southeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> where Hugo came ashore, even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> officials increased their original estimates of property damage, saying the cost there alone could run as high as $2 billion. Preliminary reports from insurance brokers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> indicate that insured losses on this island and others in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> could amount to another $1 billion to $2 billion.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> officials predicted the fallout from the killer storm would continue to plague that state's economy well into 1990.
Meanwhile, officials said they were equally concerned about the long-term effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>'s agricultural businesses and the tourism industry, which contributed $4.7 billion to the state economy in 1988 and accounted for 98,000 jobs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> officials had been predicting an 8% growth in tourism revenue this year. That number was cut in half.
In the $1 billion agricultural sector, Hugo hit just as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>'s cotton, corn and peanut crops were nearing harvest. State officials said they still lacked dollar estimates because the storm cut off contact with rural farms.
Although attention has been focused on the storm's damages in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>, Hugo also wreaked havoc when it blew across the border into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX> A city official there placed damage to local property at a minimum of $50 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> officials have asked the federal government to declare 51 western counties a disaster area.
Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX>, insurers are still trying to locate all of their policyholders in the affected areas.
An agent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Corp.</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, reported to his home office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, that just about every building in the city's downtown commercial district appears to have been damaged.
The losses from Hugo could be greater because the storm moved well inland with its driving rains and spawned numerous tornadoes, rather than just bashing the coastal regions as insurers had originally anticipated.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Insurers</ENAMEX>, who had set up claims offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charlotte</ENAMEX> to handle the rush of claims after the hurricane passed through, had to dig out and get phone and electrical service restored before they could begin helping clients. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life & Casualty</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationwide Insurance Cos.</ENAMEX>, among others, have adjusters in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX> and have set up emergency-claims offices. Some companies are putting ads in local newspapers with 800 numbers that policyholders can call for assistance.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allstate Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX>, has two mobile units driving through parts of Charleston to locate some of its policyholders.
Since banks aren't opened because there's no electricity in much of the city, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> stores are cashing checks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allstate</ENAMEX> policyholders.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, damage to the island's electric-utility company is estimated at about $20 million. Losses at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Juan</ENAMEX>'s international airport, where much equipment and small planes were damaged, could also top $20 million.
