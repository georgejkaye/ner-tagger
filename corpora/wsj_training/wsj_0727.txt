<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX> began laying the groundwork to launch a rival offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX>'s Australian brewing operations.
Such an offer could torpedo a plan by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lion Nathan Ltd.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> to acquire half the brewing interests. But it would probably increase the amount of cash that debt-ridden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> would earn from the transaction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Commission</ENAMEX> said it will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.A. Brewing</ENAMEX> to acquire an option on as much as 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX> that is in the process of acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>'s brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars (US$1.93 billion).
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.A. Brewing</ENAMEX>, which is 20%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders IXL Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s largest brewer, will make a takeover offer for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Resources</ENAMEX> if it exercises the option, the corporate regulators said in a statement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bond Corp.</ENAMEX>, a brewing, property, media and resources concern controlled by financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX>, is selling many of its assets to reduce an A$6.9 billion debt.
