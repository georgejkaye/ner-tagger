<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Lang</ENAMEX>, who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of Ms. and Sassy, is candid about the challenge he is taking on.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> admits that Ms. is ``in dire straits'' and that Sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive. But the 57-year-old publisher has moved quickly and boldly to deal with the magazines' problems.
Last Friday, he told the staff of Ms. that the magazine in January would begin publishing without advertising. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> will do away with expensive circulation drives, not to mention sales staff, and attempt to publish the 17-year-old magazine supported by circulation revenue alone.
``Any fool can publish a money-losing magazine. I want to publish one that succeeds,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX>. ``For Ms., it's time to publish for the reader, not the advertiser.''
As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX>, which competes directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seventeen magazine</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> says that in the next two years he will spend $6 million promoting and improving the magazine.
Though Sassy has grown quickly since its debut in March 1988, it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen-age problems.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> said the former Australian owners of Sassy were ``blind-sided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority.... Their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out.'' He said Sassy will keep its irreverent tone, but added, ``We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sassy</ENAMEX> already has recovered; circulation has quickly passed the 500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300. What's more, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> says he has what all publishers wish for: a bona fide niche. ``Seventeen is written more for mothers, not their daughters,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX>. ``But Sassy has a different spirit. It gets more mail in a month than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX>'s got in a year, and it's not from mothers. I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matilda Publications Inc.</ENAMEX> by his newly formed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> owns 70% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matilda</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> owns the rest through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp Venture Capital Partners</ENAMEX>. Two weeks ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> pumped $800,000 into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matilda</ENAMEX> just to keep the doors open.
Industry observers have congratulated Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> on what some call his ``courageous'' handling of Ms., but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews.
Besides Ms. and Sassy, closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX> includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Success</ENAMEX>, a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses, and Working Woman and Working Mother, two monthly magazines. Working Woman, with circulation near one million, and Working Mother, with 625,000 circulation, are legitimate magazine success stories. The magazine Success, however, was for years lackluster and unfocused. Only recently has it been attractively redesigned and its editorial product improved. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> is expected to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Venture</ENAMEX>, another magazine for growing companies.
Working Woman and Working Mother have operated as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Woman/Mccall's Group</ENAMEX>, a less-than-successful joint venture between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX> The joint venture is being undone, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX>'s magazine being sold last summer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine Group</ENAMEX> for about $80 million, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> agreeing to sell back its 50% interest in Working Woman and Working Mother to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX>.
Executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine Co.</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>, have said the joint venture with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> wasn't a good one. The venture, formed in 1986, was supposed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s low-cost, safe entry into women's magazines. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates individually with advertisers, a practice common in broadcasting but considered taboo by magazine publishers.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX>'s put in a less than stellar performance. Until a recent comeback, it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality, and in the end, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> executive who asked not to be identified said, ``Frankly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX>'s and the joint venture were an embarrassment.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> feels that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'s priorities changed. ``Their management changed right after {the venture was formed}, and I don't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women's service magazines.''
Today, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> believes his magazines will offer what many women's magazines don't. ``We write straight for women on their level,'' he said. ``We don't have passive readers.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> points out that even Success, in part, fits the company's image, since about 30 % of its readership is female.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> has named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Taber</ENAMEX>, 43, as group publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX>. She will oversee <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX>, Working Mother and Success magazines, and retain her post as publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Working Woman</ENAMEX>.
The sale price of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccall</ENAMEX>'s -- twice what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> originally paid for it -- will finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lang Communications</ENAMEX>' buy-back of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s 50% interest in Working Woman and Working Mother. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lang</ENAMEX> says he isn't scouting new acquisitions, at least for now. ``We would have to go outside to banks to get the money and I am not ready to do that,'' he said. ``Besides, we have enough on our plate. There is plenty of work to be done on what we have.
