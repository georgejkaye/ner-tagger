Lights Out
Burning coal brings acid rain,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX> goes up in smoke,
A little more exhaust from cars
And everyone will choke.
At the rate we use up oil,
The fossil fuels won't last,
Electric power is a shock,
And nuclear -- a blast.
If we don't find other means,
Or so say all the sages,
Our future won't be all that  bright,
More like the old Dark Ages.

Frothy Viewing
These shows are aptly named
From what I can gather:
Soap operas tend to work
Their fans into a lather.
