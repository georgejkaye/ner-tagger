<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> said it has asked computer-accessory makers to produce adaptor cards for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>\ line of computers that will enable them to transfer data two to four times faster than they currently do.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said the cards will unlock capabilities already built into its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>\ line, which features the so-called Micro Channel data pathway. The cards won't be available until at least some time next year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said, although officials added that some cards currently available can speed data transfer in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>\ models, which first hit the stores in 1987.
The announcement by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Armonk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, represents the latest escalation of the marketing battle between it and a group of rival personal-computer companies known as the Gang of Nine. The battle is over whose data pathway, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s Micro Channel or its rivals' Extended Industry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard Architecture</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EISA</ENAMEX>, will become the industry standard. The battle stems from offices' growing reliance on personal computers, as opposed to work stations, which has resulted in a need for more flexible, faster-working Pcs.
Not surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Swavely</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> division of Gang of Nine leader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX>, wasn't impressed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s announcement. ``It's the same old stuff,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swavely</ENAMEX> said, adding, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> doesn't have any new products to announce,'' thus, ``it's trying to fight the market-share war with words.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said that, with certain of the 29 different adaptor cards it's asking manufacturers to produce, Micro Channel Pcs will be able to double the rate at which they transmit data. The speed will be added by eliminating the need to send information on where the data are going before the data are actually transmitted. With the card, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said, the two functions will occur simultaneously.
Meanwhile, other adaptor cards will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX>\ to transmit data four times faster, using a technology known as multiplexing. A telephone term, multiplexing is a way of compressing data so that more than one conversation can occur on the same line at the same time.
In a related development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said it entered into agreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chips & Technologies Inc.</ENAMEX> and with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> to develop chip sets to facilitate the use of the new adaptor cards.
