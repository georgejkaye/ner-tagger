<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serious Fraud Office</ENAMEX> said it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal & Control</ENAMEX> unit.
The investigation, which will be coordinated with one already under way in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, follows the discovery of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> has called a ``serious'' fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal & Control</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, a defense-equipment manufacturer, was bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> in 1987 for # 420 million ($670.3 million). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> has said that it would be forced to write off # 185 million against the phantom contracts, reducing its net asset value by more than half.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serious Fraud Office</ENAMEX>, a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan</ENAMEX> Police responsible for investigating financial crimes, said its work would take in ``allegations of fraud prior to, surrounding and subsequent to the merger.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will ``cooperate fully.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Derek Alun-Jones</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s chairman, has said he hoped to pursue legal action against those responsible.
The British defense electronics group has said it will sell # 100 million in assets and may seek a merger to strengthen itself in the wake of its troubles.
