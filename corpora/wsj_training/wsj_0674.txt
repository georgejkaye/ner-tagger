<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim Pattison Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX>, one of a group of closely held companies owned by entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Pattison</ENAMEX>, said it ``intends to seek control'' of 30%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Innopac Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> packaging concern.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim Pattison Industries</ENAMEX>, a holding company with annual sales of about C$1.9 billion, largely from car dealerships and grocery stores, didn't elaborate on the statement, and a company official declined further comment.
The company said it currently holds about 4.2 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Innopac</ENAMEX>'s 13.8 million common shares outstanding, which have an aggregate market value of about 137.8 million Canadian dollars (US$117.3 million).
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Innopac</ENAMEX> reported a fourth-quarter loss of about C$2.6 million, or 18 Canadian cents a share, reflecting inventory write-downs. The results made net income for the year ended Aug. 31 C$2.7 million, or 20 Canadian cents a share, down from C$9.7 million, or 70 Canadian cents a share last year. Revenue was C$291.6 million, up from C$252 million in 1988.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin Fabi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Innopac</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Innopac</ENAMEX> viewed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pattison</ENAMEX>'s decision to seek control as a ``very positive'' move. ``I'm happy that he feels positively about our company,'' he said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fabi</ENAMEX> wouldn't say directly whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pattison</ENAMEX> has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control.
Among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Innopac</ENAMEX> is involved in recycling polystyrene foam products that are often used by fast food chains, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonald's Corp.</ENAMEX>, for food packaging. A joint venture involving units of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Innopac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> earlier this year opened the first U.S. polystyrene recycling plant, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leominster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>
