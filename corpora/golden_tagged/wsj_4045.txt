The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means</ENAMEX> subcommittee on oversight said it will conduct a hearing this month on the financial performance of a program run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>. The subcommittee said an investigation has disclosed that the program, which seizes property from drug dealers and other lawbreakers and then auctions it off, has been operating at a financial loss. The hearing has been set for Oct. 10.
``I simply can't understand why a program that is supposed to take the fruits of drug smuggling from the criminals has actually operated to drain scarce law-enforcement dollars from the federal government,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J.J. Pickle</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>), the subcommittee chairman.
In a recent story in this newspaper, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop</ENAMEX> officials defended their management of the program, saying they are not properly credited for items that are not sold off, but are instead distributed to government agencies for their use.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> plans before next March to competitively award an extension of the contract to run the program. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northrop</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based aerospace company, has said it's not interested in bidding on the new pact.
