<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Corona Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Canaan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, said it intends to ``vigorously defend'' itself against a patent - and copyright-infringement lawsuit brought against it by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin Computer Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Holly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>
The Franklin suit, reported earlier,  alleges that two electronic spelling machines made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Cornona</ENAMEX> violate patents and copyrights on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Franklin</ENAMEX>'s hand-held spellers, which appeared in the market several years before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Corona</ENAMEX>'s models.
In a statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Corona</ENAMEX> said the technology in its spelling machines is ``directly derived from the spelling technology used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Corona</ENAMEX>'s typewriters which were introduced long before any Franklin spelling devices existed in the market.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Corona</ENAMEX> didn't comment on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Franklin</ENAMEX>'s charge that it is falsely advertising its spelling-only devices as ``dictionaries.
