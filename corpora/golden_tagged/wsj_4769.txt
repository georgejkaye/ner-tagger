The Nasdaq over-the-counter market drifted lower in lackluster trading despite a lot of takeover activity and a firmer technology sector, as ambivalent investors continued to move to the sidelines.
The OTC market practically stood still for much of last week until Friday's small advance. But yesterday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite Index surrendered that gain, falling 1.36 to 466.71 on a paltry 108.1 million shares. Still, its 0.3% decline compared favorable with the 0.8% drop posted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite index.
Among bigger stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index was unchanged at 447.78, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Financial Index</ENAMEX> fell 0.6%, or 2.58, to 460.43. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average, by comparison, was off 0.8%.
``The greatest factor out there is fear,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reese Austin</ENAMEX>, first vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Keegan & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX>.
Although there is plenty of takeover action in the OTC market, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin</ENAMEX> said, many money managers aren't interested in playing. The investors have watched their portfolio values grow handsomely already this year, he said. Now, they just want to protect their gains.
``They worry that if they sell they will be wrong and if they buy they'll be wrong,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Austin</ENAMEX> said. ``Everything is in neutral right now. It's tough for brokers because we like to wiggle money out of people, and we can't in this environment.''
On the takeover front, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.M.S.S.</ENAMEX> soared 14 1/8, or 41%, to 48 7/8 on 2.5 million shares, topping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX>'s most active list. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secomerica</ENAMEX> agreed to acquire the provider of home infusion therapy services for $50 a share, or about $250 million, through a tender offer to begin this week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secomerica</ENAMEX> is a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secom</ENAMEX>, a provider of commercial and residential security services that recently has diversified into the communications and health services fields. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael S. Kaye</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Secomerica</ENAMEX>, said the company intends to preserve the current operating structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.M.S.S.</ENAMEX>
The shares of other companies that provide home health care services rose in active trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.M.S.S.</ENAMEX> news. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Critical Care</ENAMEX> gained 1 3/4 to 41 1/2 on 374,000 shares, although analysts said a takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Critical Care</ENAMEX> isn't necessarily imminent. Care Plus jumped 1 1/2 to 9 7/8 on 358,000 shares.
Overseas companies figured prominently in two other acquisition stories in the OTC market. American depositary receipts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance</ENAMEX> surged 3 5/8 to 74 1/4. The insurer has agreed to pay $42 million for 10% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management Holding.</ENAMEX> Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine</ENAMEX> will receive newly issued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX> shares and a seat on its board.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Management</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokio Marine</ENAMEX> will place substantial assets under management with the money management firm when the transaction is completed and will make additional contributions in the future.
The Adrs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>, the British automaker, improved 5/32 to 9 9/32 on turnover of about two million shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX> has said it intends to buy as much as 15% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors</ENAMEX> Class B shares gained 1 1/2 to 23 3/4. The brewer agreed in principle to acquire a substantial number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroh Brewery</ENAMEX>'s facilities and brands for $425 million, as well as some of its liabilities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connaught Biosciences</ENAMEX> gained 3 1/8 to 31 3/4. The company accepted a takeover bid from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institut Merieux</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, which topped an offer made jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciba-Geigy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiron</ENAMEX>, a biotechnology issue, rose 1/4 to 26 1/4.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX>'s biggest technology stocks were mostly higher. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications</ENAMEX> rose 3/4 to 45 5/8 on 2.2 million shares; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> gained 3 3/4 to 108 7/8 on speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaw Cellular</ENAMEX> might raise its bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX>, which has agreed to merge its domestic cellular telephone interests with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> gained 3/8 to 45 1/4 on 1.2 million shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus Computer</ENAMEX> rose 1/2 to 24 1/2 on nearly 800,000 shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems</ENAMEX> gained 3/8 to 16 7/8 on 1.1 million shares, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> rose 1 to 67, a 52-week high.
