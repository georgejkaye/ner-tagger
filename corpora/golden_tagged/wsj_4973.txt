<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen M. Wolf</ENAMEX>, under fire from employee groups over profits he stands to gain from a labor-management takeover, pledged to work to ensure employees make a profit on their own investment in the buy-out.
In his first interview since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>'s board approved a $6.79 billion takeover bid from senior managers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>' pilot union and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> defended both the buy-out plan and the terms it offers him and other managers. The 85% stake reserved for management and employees would make UAL the largest employee-owned company in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
While the 48-year-old chairman is guaranteed to benefit financially from the buy-out, he cautioned ``there can be no promises'' that the same would be true for rank-and-file employees. However, he added: ``It is my objective to return to employees 100% of their investment and a significant profit margin on top of that.''
Tender offer documents made public Friday disclosed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> would reap $76.7 million from the stock and options he holds in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> once the transaction is completed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John C. Pope</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>'s chief financial officer, would receive $37.7 million from his stock and options.
The documents also showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pope</ENAMEX> and another 35 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> executives participating in the buy-out would receive new stock and options amounting to a 10% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> once the buy-out is completed. Financial experts estimate the value of these new options at between $65 million and $90 million.
The disclosure of the executives' profit comes at a time when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> is trying to persuade all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> employees to make wage concessions and productivity improvements to help finance the takeover. So far, only the pilot union has agreed to participate, pledging $250 million in annual concessions and $200 million from a pension plan toward the buy-out.
In the interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> said he was convinced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> would succumb to a takeover following a $5.4 billion bid from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> called the terms offered to management ``fair.'' But in an apparent effort to deflect criticism, he said he plans to forgo his $575,000 annual salary for the first year following the takeover. He also said he would work without a contract indefinitely.
Such a move would prevent him from receiving substantial ``golden parachute'' severance pay should he leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s employment. He also said that he would lose his lucrative new options in the employee-owned company if he is fired.
He said he has asked other senior managers participating in the buy-out to work without similar contracts. He also said he plans to donate $1 million from his profits to charities that run educational profits, in addition to starting his own foundation dedicated to education issues.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>'s overtures did little to appease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s machinists union, which has complained the most about the current buy-out plan. A machinists spokesman said the union finds the management windfall ``offensive.''
The machinists union is also upset that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>'s outside directors gave themselves $20,000-a-year salaries for life. They also approved unlimited free travel privileges for themselves and their spouses. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> said only one of the current outside directors will be returning to the board once the company is sold.
The union criticized the directors for rejecting a recapitalization plan its financial advisers had proposed as an option. The recapitalization would have given employees a 50% ownership stake but placed less debt on the airline. The labor-management buy-out would result in $7.2 billion in debt.
The recapitalization would have resulted in $2.5 billion less new debt, ``but less of a financial boon for management and the financial advisers,'' the spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Kelley</ENAMEX>, spokesman for a group representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> non-contract employees, said those workers find management's profits ``hard to take, especially when the company is about to take something out of {workers'} pockets.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelley</ENAMEX> said he believes the latest disclosures will cost management some support.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX>'s support also appears to be slipping among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>'s flight attendants. The flight attendants union balked last week at management's request for a maximum 10% wage cut.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> said he doesn't anticipate opposition to the buy-out from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>. Last week, Transportation Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> expressed renewed concern about the leveraging of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines and investments in them by foreign carriers.
On Friday, people familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Checchi</ENAMEX> to reduce KLM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX>' $400 million investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>. The move raised the possibility the agency may seek changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX>' $750 million equity investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> in return for a 15% stake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>'s stock dropped $5.125 to $281.125 in composite trading on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> Friday on fears the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> transaction might be disrupted.
Under terms of the new executive options, a management group of 37 executives will pay $15 million for a 1% stake in the new company, and won't have to pay any extra for options on another 9% at the same exercise price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Figlewski</ENAMEX>, a finance professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York University</ENAMEX> business school, said a rough ``back-of-the-envelope'' estimate of the value of the options is $80 million to $90 million. A takeover stock trader valued the options at about $65 million.
The deal will also generate fees of more than $231.6 million for several <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> securities firms, law firms, and banks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX>, adviser to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> board, will receive $23.9 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX>, advisers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> pilot union, will share $34 million.
