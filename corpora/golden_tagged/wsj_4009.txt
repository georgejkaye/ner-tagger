<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli Lilly & Co.</ENAMEX> is revamping quality-control procedures throughout the company following <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> inspectors' discovery of widespread quality-control problems at an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> drug plant.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> wants to have ``good, strong controls over the whole thing because we don't want more problems to emerge,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard D. Wood</ENAMEX>, chairman of the pharmaceutical maker, in an interview here Friday. The steps mark <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>'s first acknowledgment of the seriousness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> situation, which arose from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> investigation.
In a departure from industry practice, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> now will oversee quality control from its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> headquarters rather than leaving it up to individual facilities. Centralizing responsibility means ``we will have complete control at the corporate level,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX> said. Before, ``there was oversight but no direct-line responsibility'' for monitoring production quality. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> also is making some management changes as part of this overhaul, he said.
Last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> halted the distribution of all drugs made at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> plant and recalled 10 drugs after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> inspectors sharply criticized quality-control procedures. The problems centered on submission of false or incomplete data, poor record keeping and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>'s failure to adequately train quality-control officers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s report triggered a separate probe by the investigations subcommittee of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX>. The panel wants to learn whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> filed false or misleading information with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> about its manufacturing processes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> now is looking at three other Lilly drug plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> to determine whether they have problems like the ones found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> officials have tended to downplay the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> plant's problems as largely technical aberrations. The company hopes the facility ``will shortly resume full production and shipment,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX> told a group of U.K. analysts and fund managers here.
As part of the quality-control shakeup, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wood</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Williams</ENAMEX> has assumed the new post of vice president for quality control. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX> previously was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>'s vice president of agricultural research. Two other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> executives involved with directing quality control or the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> facility have been demoted to less responsible jobs, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> chairman indicated.
