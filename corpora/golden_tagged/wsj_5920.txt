The Canadian government plans to ban smoking on all international flights by Canadian airlines.
The ban is to take effect at the end of this year, making <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> likely to be the first country to prohibit smoking on all international flights.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> is on the vanguard of a world-wide movement,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Sweanor</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Non-Smokers' Rights Association</ENAMEX>, a Canadian lobby group.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, like many other countries, already prohibits smoking on all domestic flights under two hours. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Senate</ENAMEX> approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline flights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Thursday, but the measure now will go before a conference committee of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s two largest airlines, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Airlines International Ltd.</ENAMEX>, which is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PWA Corp.</ENAMEX>, voluntarily extended the current Canadian ban to include all domestic and North American flights.
The ban on international flights is part of a new law that prohibits smoking in federally regulated workplaces including government buildings, trains and banks. A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Transport</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benoit Bouchard</ENAMEX> said the draft regulations can still be changed but she said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bouchard</ENAMEX> ``feels strongly'' about them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Sinclair</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Transport Association of Canada</ENAMEX> said the airline industry was ``generally supportive'' of the ban but he said it could be ``a possible disadvantage'' given that all other international carriers allow smoking.
``It's a form of discrimination against a portion of the Canadian traveling public,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Lariviere</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council</ENAMEX>.
Earlier this year, the Canadian government implemented a law that prohibits tobacco advertising in newspapers and magazines and phases out billboard advertising. It also prevents tobacco companies from using cigarette brand names to sponsor sports and cultural events.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Tobacco Ltd</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imasco Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR-Macdonald Inc.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>, launched joint court action to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Hearings are scheduled to begin Monday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc.</ENAMEX>, which is 40%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX> and 60%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rothmans Inc.</ENAMEX>, has launched a separate court action, which is due to begin in October.
