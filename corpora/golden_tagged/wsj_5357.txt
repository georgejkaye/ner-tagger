A major shareholder has joined a legal battle opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental Petroleum Corp.</ENAMEX>'s plans to spend about $86 million on a museum for Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armand Hammer</ENAMEX>'s art.
In a filing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware Court</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chancery</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Public Employees Retirement System</ENAMEX> asked to intervene in existing litigation that seeks to block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental</ENAMEX>'s funding of the museum. It also demands the return of art owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armand Hammer Foundation</ENAMEX> and allegedly bought indirectly with corporate funds, and asks the court to cut off Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammer</ENAMEX>'s salary.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> retirement system, the nation's second-largest pension fund, holds about two million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental</ENAMEX>'s 269 million common shares. It called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental</ENAMEX>'s outlays for the museum ``unreasonable and a waste of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental</ENAMEX>'s assets'' that provide ``no corresponding benefit for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental.</ENAMEX>''
The litigation was initiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan R. Kahn</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investment manager, on behalf of the relatively small holding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental</ENAMEX> stock for which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX> is trustee. The proposed intervention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> retirement system appears to give weight to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX>'s position that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental</ENAMEX> shareholders don't support the project.
A court spokesman said a hearing date hasn't been set on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> retirement system's motion to intervene.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Occidental</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the filing but noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> retirement system has once before presented an affadavit in the case in support of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX>.
