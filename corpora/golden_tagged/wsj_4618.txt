Missouri regulators and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.</ENAMEX> reached a settlement agreement that forces the company to cut rates $82 million a year while allowing it to earn more profit and modernize an aging phone network.
The agreement, reached after a three-month dispute, is bittersweet for the unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell Corp.</ENAMEX> In June, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Missouri Public Service Commission</ENAMEX> ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell Telephone</ENAMEX> to cut Missouri rates $101 million a year -- the largest reduction in the state's history.
At that time, the commission also rejected the company's plea for rate reform, jeopardizing its plan to spend $180 million to install digital switches in 112 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> communities by 1990. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell</ENAMEX> filed suit to appeal the decision; it dropped the suit as part of the settlement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Hubbard</ENAMEX>, an assistant vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell Telephone</ENAMEX>, called the pact an ``important first step'' but said he viewed the commission's ``rate reduction as a significantly negative element of the settlement.''
Under the accord, regulators approved an incentive regulation plan that will allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell Telephone</ENAMEX> to maintain a 14.1% authorized rate of return on equity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell</ENAMEX> would be allowed to keep 40% of the earnings above the 14.1% level and 50% if the return on equity surpassed 14.5%. But it won't be allowed to request a rate increase until 1993.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Initially</ENAMEX>, the commission had cut <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell Telephone</ENAMEX>'s authorized rate of return on equity to 12.61% from 14.7%.
In return, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern Bell Telephone</ENAMEX>, which serves 1.9 million Missouri customers, will cut rates Oct. 1.
