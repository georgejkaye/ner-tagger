Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say.
The property claims service division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Insurance Service Group</ENAMEX>, a trade association, is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow. ``Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record,'' said one official, far surpassing the $752.5 million insurers paid out after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frederick</ENAMEX> ripped through several <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf Coast</ENAMEX> states in
The impact on premium rates could be minimal for now, analysts expect, because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area -- for homes and autos. Most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future. In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers haven't had to dip into these funds. And since Hugo also stormed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, foreign insurers are at risk for some of the damage on those islands.
Yet, some analysts believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX>'s huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months. Rates have been falling since late 1986. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Udayan Ghose</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> believes these reasons might cause rates to edge higher by mid-1990.
For the time being, the losses from Hugo ``will be substantial, but they won't be something the industry can't handle,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles L. Ruoff</ENAMEX>, director of strategic planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fred S. James & Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based insurance broker.
For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> estimates it will pay claims totaling more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationwide Insurance Co.</ENAMEX>, a mutual company based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, said Hugo ``is the single largest claims disaster'' it has seen in its 63-year history. The company, which is the largest home and auto insurer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and No. 3 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>, has already received 16,000 claims from the stricken region. Claims could total $100 million, a spokesman said.
For some insurers, Hugo was a double-whammy. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Corp.</ENAMEX>, which is a big insurer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolinas</ENAMEX>, said it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter, reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane. ``Hugo will be particularly costly to us,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John P. Mascotte</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental's</ENAMEX> chairman.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna Corp.</ENAMEX>, which has extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USF&G Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, a big insurer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolina</ENAMEX> region, could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings, analysts said. Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USF&G</ENAMEX>'s losses hit very close home -- its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX> office was destroyed by the hurricane.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USF&G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cigna</ENAMEX> declined to predict whether they would take a charge; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USF&G</ENAMEX> said it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of losses, and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo</ENAMEX> could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travelers Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chubb Corp.</ENAMEX>, according to industry analysts.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruoff</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred S. James</ENAMEX> believes that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough ``financial pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends,'' to compel them to boost premium rates right away. He explained that in the first six months of this year, net income for the industry declined slightly from 1988, but insurance companies were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity.
He also noted that the industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently at $125 billion, is also plentiful. Generally, insurers can book about $3 of premiums for every $1 of surplus. Right now, premiums total about $200 billion, he said.
An official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nationwide Insurance</ENAMEX> noted that the company has $1 of surplus for every $2 of insurance that it writes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insurers</ENAMEX> also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Lewis</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds</ENAMEX> said losses from Hugo could be big enough to ``temporarily'' increase reinsurance rates.
Although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some companies, the losses they must still cover could hurt third-quarter results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niagara Exchange Corp.</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charleston Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> unit faces as a result of the hurricane.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX>, the nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance. It believes its reserves are plentiful enough to absorb its losses, a spokesman said.

Entertainment industry sources said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> plans to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Guber</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> executive and producer, to run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> remained silent but people familiar with the transaction said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> has offered $3.4 billion, or $27 a share, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Kaufman</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, who stands to make more than $30 million in the transaction, is said to be leaving the company. The sources said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaufman</ENAMEX> had wanted to leave in the event of a sale.
Neither Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> nor Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaufman</ENAMEX> could be reached for comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> said its board is meeting today to weigh an offer for the company. While neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> have acknowledged that they are talking with each other, people familiar with the talks said an offer was made Monday. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> said only that its board met last night to review discussions with a suitor concerning the possible acquisition for cash of all of the company's shares outstanding. It said the meeting was adjourned until today.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> is 49%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> is co-chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX>, which until recently was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> runs the company with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co-Chief</ENAMEX> Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Peters</ENAMEX>. Entertainment industry sources said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> also is expected to purchase at least part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> are two of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>'s most successful producers; their hits have included ``Batman,'' produced for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Bros.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA Communications Co.</ENAMEX>'s ``Rainman'' and ``Gorillas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mist</ENAMEX>,'' released by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Pictures.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX> is currently producing ``Bonfire of the Vanities ``for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner</ENAMEX>. From 1973 to 1975, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> was vice president, world-wide production, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>'s film studio, reporting to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Begelman</ENAMEX>, head of film production.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guber</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peters</ENAMEX> sold their closely held movie-production company to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barris</ENAMEX> last year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westfield Holdings</ENAMEX>, a venture-capital company, also holds a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters</ENAMEX>.
Industry observers said they don't expect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>'s Japanese rivals -- some of which also have been looking at studios -- necessarily to follow its example. In part, analysts say, that's because they have too many other, non-consumer businesses to justify spending the money or giving a new business the necessary management attention. Officials at electronics makers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanyo Electric Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.</ENAMEX>, for instance, said they have no immediate interest in buying a foreign studio.
The most-likely contender is a 50% <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matsushita</ENAMEX>-owned firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Victor Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, which last month poured more than $100 million into a joint venture with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX> producer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Gordon</ENAMEX> to develop, produce and finance movies. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JVC</ENAMEX> says it's happy with the move and isn't thinking about buying a studio.
``I think they've made their choice,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darrell Whitten</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Bache Securities</ENAMEX>. ``Rather than go out there and buy a library, they should build one.''
Indeed, if any Japanese companies do decide to copy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and try to buy a U.S. movie studio, they may be from different industries altogether. Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s big trading companies, with margins narrowing on their traditional businesses, are looking for profitable new businesses that would allow them to put to use their vast distribution channels and access to cheap financing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard S. Kelly Jr.</ENAMEX>, a managing director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> office, said news that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> is close to pouncing on a studio may spur them into action. ``If this doesn't crystallize the decision, at least it will start the ultimate decisionmaking process,'' he said. ``You can't keep sitting on the fence.''
