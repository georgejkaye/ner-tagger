Petroleum ministers will try again Monday to resolve their differences over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s production ceiling and individual output quotas after wrestling with the dual issues over the weekend.
Chances of reaching agreement on either issue before the regular winter conference of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Petroleum Exporting</ENAMEX> Countries, which begins Nov. 25 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX>, appear dim. The ministers meeting here made little headway in efforts to parcel out new shares of the increased demand for their oil.
The issues have divided the 13-nation OPEC into two camps. They also have put Kuwait on the opposite side of its usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> allies of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX> has openly flouted its production quota this year, producing nearly double its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> allotment of 1.1 million barrels a day in recent months. Last night, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuwait</ENAMEX> held steadfast to its stand since early this year that it and some others are due special treatment in any increases in the production limits. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuwaiti</ENAMEX> oil minister, has made it clear he feels free to produce whatever he chooses, so long as his claim for a higher OPEC quota isn't met.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> maintained an equally hard position that any ceiling increase should be shared on a pro rata basis. ``The ceiling is the eminent problem,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s oil minister, ``but we should address the problem of the quotas if we can.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX>, which also is exceeding its allocations by several hundred thousand barrels a day, and several others are also requesting favored treatment. Their extra output has sent production of the 13 nations to more than 22 million barrels a day. That is a record level for this year, and it is sharply above the second half production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day.
So far, demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s oil is matching the high production rates. Also, oil prices are holding relatively stable, although many of the ministers argued that OPEC prices still average below the 1989 target of $18 a barrel because of the excess production.
Demand for OPEC oil is expected to climb even higher in the fourth quarter -- possibly reaching 23 million barrels a day. As a result, some OPEC countries -- chiefly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> -- are pressing for an increase in the production ceiling of as much as two million barrels a day to ``legitimize'' more of the extra output that would be produced anyway to meet the higher demand.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheik Ali</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX> won't accept any increase in the overall ceiling unless new long-term quotas are established that would treat those countries with spare producing capacity with special consideration. For Kuwait he seeks an initial quota of 1.35 million barrels a day, based on the current OPEC ceiling of 19.5 million, plus a proportionate share of any increase in the ceiling.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX>'s position on the ceiling is that an increase is fine -- if it's used to solve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX>'s {quota} problems,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuwaiti</ENAMEX> delegate.
Some other OPEC members, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Algeria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX>, oppose any increase in the ceiling as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OPEC</ENAMEX> average price, currently less than $17 a barrel, is below the targeted $18 a barrel. Others are flexible on the matter of the ceiling. ``We basically want to maintain stability in the oil market, and we are not fixed to any position,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ginandjar Kartasasmita</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indonesia</ENAMEX>'s oil minister, said in an interview.
