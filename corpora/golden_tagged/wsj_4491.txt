<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Controls Inc.</ENAMEX> trimmed its profit estimate 5% for the year ending Saturday, citing a slowdown in the automobile industry, among other things.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milkaukee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wis.</ENAMEX>-based seat and battery maker projected that fiscal 1989 profit would be flat compared with fiscal 1988 profit of $103.5 million, or $2.83 a primary share, generated on sales of $3.1 billion.
In the wake of lower-than-expected seat sales to the automobile industry, a five-week labor strike at a battery plant and higher interest expenses, among other things, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Controls</ENAMEX> said it expects 1989 profit to drop 5% from last year.
Per-share earnings for the year will drop more than 5% because of the dilutive effect of an employee stock-ownership plan started in May, a spokeswoman said.
In composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, the company closed unchanged at $34.875 a share.
