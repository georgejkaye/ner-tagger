What is the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder, Peabody & Co.</ENAMEX> doing teamed up with rival broker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles Schwab & Co.</ENAMEX>?
Trying to squeeze whatever profits can still be made from the business of selling stocks to individual investors, it seems. In an agreement that might have been unheard of only a short time ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> has joined forces with Schwab to sell stocks, bonds, options and mutual funds through an electronic system that competes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s own Kidder brokers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX>, the big discount-brokerage firm, makes a business of tweaking such ``full service'' brokerages as Kidder for the higher commissions they must charge. Now, it's getting the help of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s own parent to spread its gospel.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX>'s discount brokerage and investment information services have just became available on an at-home computer system called Genie. The Genie system, offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Information Services</ENAMEX>, has more than 167,000 subscribers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theoretically</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> customers looking to save money could abandon their Kidder brokers and opt for the lower costs for stock trading available through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwab</ENAMEX> on Genie.
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwab</ENAMEX> issued a news release in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles R. Schwab</ENAMEX>, took a direct swipe at full-service brokerage firms.
``More investors today are bypassing the mystique and extra expense of traditional financial service firms and are instead taking more control of their financial affairs,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX> says, not mentioning Kidder by name.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fairfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, insists that the parent company isn't setting one of its children against the other, because ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> isn't in the discount-brokerage business.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V. Sheehan</ENAMEX>, managing director in charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s brokerage network, is expected to take to the firm's nationwide communications system first thing this morning to explain the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>\ marriage to his sales force. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX> says his point will be that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX> are in ``different businesses.''
Yet that rationalization may be a tough sell to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s 1,500 brokers. It certainly has been for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX> unit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, with its Prodigy electronic homeshopping system, has been undercutting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> brokers by offering stock trading at lower commissions, just as Genie will. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter</ENAMEX> brokers were furious when the Prodigy system started up and they discovered that some of their clients were bypassing them.
``When our brokers first read something like this, it could sound like a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GE</ENAMEX> initiative that could be a threat someday,'' acknowledges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX>. ``But it is not a major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">GE</ENAMEX> initiative. Anybody who's providing these home network services has got to be able to allow consumers through their (personal computers) to access a broad spectrum of services,'' including stock trading, he says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>, he says, stands ``prepared to compete on the basis of what we think is the real value to customers, the value from us that you can't get from discount brokers.''
The selling point of a discount broker is cheap commission rates. In exchange, an investor forgoes the stock research and advice provided by a full-service broker.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX> says that on the Genie system, the commissions offered will save investors as much as 76% compared with full-commission brokers. Also, Genie users for a limited time will be given a commission rebate by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX> of as much as $100 on their first three trades.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX> already has its own system, called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Equalizer</ENAMEX>, that allows investors to trade stocks at home. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-based discount broker has been trying to expand its electronic business; a spokeswoman says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwab</ENAMEX> anticipates that 25% to 30% of its business will come from electronic delivery channels in the next few years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Keefe</ENAMEX>, a financial-services analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> might be able to have its cake and eat it too, providing that Kidder brokers don't raise too much of a stink. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keefe</ENAMEX> says that instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder</ENAMEX>'s traditional, older investors, the Genie system ``will appeal to a more progressive, more highly educated, probably younger group that does its own research and knows how to work computers.
