<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli Lilly & Co.</ENAMEX> said it will build a $115 million plant near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strasbourg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, to boost production of a genetically engineered form of human insulin.
Construction of the plant, which will be the pharmaceutical concern's third facility to make the product, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humulin</ENAMEX>, will begin next autumn, with production starting in early 1993.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, is the world's largest producer of insulin, which is used by diabetics. About half of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> diabetics currently use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humulin</ENAMEX>, which is made by recombinant-DNA procedures and thus differs from the natural protein extracted from animal sources. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> spokesman said that use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humulin</ENAMEX>, introduced in 1982, is growing.
The French plant, which will employ about 300 people, will be built in the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fegersheim</ENAMEX>, adjacent to an existing Lilly manufacturing operation that has about 500 workers.
