choose one: A bowl of ice cream. Or a scoop of frozen processed dairy dessert with cellulose gel.
Chances are, no matter how good the frozen processed stuff tastes, not too many people are going to buy anything with a moniker like that. And that could turn out to be quite a marketing problem for the dairy industry. Every major dairy company in the country right now is trying to find ways to create low-calorie, low-cholesterol ice creams, cheeses and yogurts. They're experimenting with two all-natural fat substitutes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> is currently reviewing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olestra</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto Nutrasweet</ENAMEX> unit's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Simplesse</ENAMEX>.
But the problem is, current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> rules prohibit the dairies from using names like ``ice cream'' or ``cottage cheese'' for their low-cal creations. The names they would have to use probably would be technical -- like ``frozen processed dairy dessert'' rather than ``ice cream'' -- and technical doesn't sell. It also doesn't sound natural, even if the product itself is.
The result is a marketing quandary for the dairy companies: They don't want to pour millions of dollars into developing fat-substitute ice creams and cheeses only to be forced to use names so unappealing that consumers recoil in disgust.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> ``is going to have to re-evaluate'' its definitions of dairy foods, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Baar</ENAMEX>, vice president of sales and marketing for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borden Inc.</ENAMEX>'s dairy division, which is experimenting with fat substitutes for its ice creams, yogurts and other dairy products. He contends revisions are necessary because things like fat substitutes ``weren't even issues when those {regulations} were written originally,'' more than 40 years ago.
Kraft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Foods</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX> unit, is about to test how far the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> will let it go with a new product called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sealtest Free Nonfat Ice Cream.</ENAMEX> As previously reported, the new entrant uses cellulose gel, a natural ingredient widely used in foods, instead of fat. But the product apparently doesn't contain the 10% butterfat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> requires in ``real'' ice cream.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX> spokesman says ``the term'nonfat  ice cream' is very appropriate.'' He adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft</ENAMEX> plans to send a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> suggesting how it could revise its current frozen desert standards. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> spokesman won't comment other than to say, ``current standards say 10% butterfat is standard, so if this deviates, it isn't meeting the standard.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kraft</ENAMEX> tried a similar strategy, with some success, several years ago with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft Light Naturals Reduced Fat Cheeses</ENAMEX>, which contain less fat than FDA-defined cheeses. Regulators initially contended the label was misleading because the product doesn't meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s definition of cheese. But the controversy died down when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> didn't take action.
This time around, however, the debate is likely to intensify. Already, the rest of the dairy industry is trying to figure out where it should stand. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Borden</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baar</ENAMEX> says the company hasn't decided if it wants to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft route</ENAMEX>, boldly naming as ``yogurt'' and ``cottage cheese'' the fat-substitute products it is developing. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baar</ENAMEX> points out that if fat-substitute dairy products flop or turn out to be just fads, the company could hurt its main product line by forging ahead with those names.
``Whether or not {fat-substitute products} are long-lasting is the big issue,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baar</ENAMEX> says. ``You have to look closely before you make dramatic changes.'' He points to the short-lived soft-cookie craze that lost several companies a bundle.
Dairy trade groups are also still working out their positions. On the one hand, they don't want fat-substitute ice creams and cheeses masquerading as the real thing. Yet they want labels to distinguish between natural products, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kraft</ENAMEX>'s fat-substitute ice cream, and completely artificial knock-offs. ``We're looking at a couple of options right now to accommodate new {fat-substitute} products more readily than the current system permits,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Balmer</ENAMEX>, director of special promotions for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Ice Cream Association</ENAMEX>, a trade group.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Huggins</ENAMEX>, a dairy industry consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, notes that the issue is complicated because not only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>, but also individual states, have their own definition of what constitutes dairy products like cheese and mayonnaise.
