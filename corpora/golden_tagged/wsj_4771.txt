Your Aug. 28 ``Centennial Journal'' item ``Japanese Start a Successful Drive, 1960'' states: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> picked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Datsun</ENAMEX>, derived from the Japanese for'running  away fast,' as the name for its special U.S. brand.''
Another explanation is given in the definitive ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Complete Encyclopedia</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Motorcars</ENAMEX>,'' edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G.N. Georgano</ENAMEX>. It says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kwaishinsha Motor Car Works</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> in 1912 produced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAT</ENAMEX>, which stood for the initials of its founders' last names. In 1931 the company brought out a new, smaller car called Son-of-DAT, or simply ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Datson</ENAMEX>,'' which changed to Datsun in 1932 to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s national symbol.
In 1934, through a buy-out, the company name was changed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX>. It still made Datsuns and introduced the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> brand car in 1937. The firm abandoned the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> after the war, but Datsun and Japanese Austins continued to be built. Finally, in 1960, the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> returned on their larger car. ``Datsun'' was always the preferred marque around the world for the company's cars, while ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX>'' was used primarily on trucks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sadly</ENAMEX>, in 1983, the proud, famous and older brand was retired. I still am not sure why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> chose to spend vast sums of money to replace a time-proven, world-famous name.
