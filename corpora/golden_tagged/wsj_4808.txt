Fletcher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenge Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX>-based forest products, construction and energy concern, is studying possible acquisitions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, the company's chief executive officer said after a presentation to analysts here.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Fletcher</ENAMEX> said the company has been gathering information about possible European acquisition targets for about a year. However, the company isn't in a rush and ``the odds aren't very high {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fletcher Challenge</ENAMEX> will make an acquisition there} in the very near future,'' he said.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fletcher</ENAMEX> said that in the longer term, the company will aggressively seek to expand in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> because ``it's the logical direction to go.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX> are currently concentrated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Rim</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>. The company also has forest products operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fletcher</ENAMEX> said the company has been studying electricity and gas utilities but didn't indicate if Fletcher intends to move quickly. He said the company is also interested in the gas exploration business.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fletcher</ENAMEX> said the company's rate of growth in terms of assets over the next three years probably won't match the rate over the last three years. Assets at June 30, 1986, were 3.9 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> dollars ($2.3 billion <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>), compared with NZ$14.1 billion ($8.3 billion) June 30, 1989.
