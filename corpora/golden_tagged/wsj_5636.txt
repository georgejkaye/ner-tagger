<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM Technology Inc.</ENAMEX> said it terminated a five-month-old agreement for a $5-a-share leveraged buy-out by its majority shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour Kahn</ENAMEX>.
The announcement was made after the end of trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IPM</ENAMEX> stock, which closed at $4.25, down 12.5 cents in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, provides fueling services to civilian and military aircraft and has airport cargo-handling operations. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX> owns a 58% stake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX> said the agreement was terminated because a special committee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX>'s board determined that the $5-per-share price was no longer fair. A company spokesman declined to elaborate.
The agreement, reached in early April by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SK Acquisition Inc.</ENAMEX>, which is wholly owned by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX>, called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SK</ENAMEX> to tender for the 42% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IPM</ENAMEX>'s stock that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX> didn't already own. The offer had an indicated value of about $4.5 million. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kahn</ENAMEX> told the committee that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SK</ENAMEX> can't obtain financing for a higher offer.
