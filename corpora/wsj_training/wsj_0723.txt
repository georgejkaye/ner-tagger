<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> employers fear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC Commission</ENAMEX>'s plans for a ``charter of fundamental social rights'' is a danger to industrial competitiveness.
``We don't want <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz</ENAMEX>, secretary general of the employers' confederation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unice</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unice</ENAMEX> -- an acronym for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> -- fears that the charter will force <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EC</ENAMEX> countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations. Workers and management, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> said, would lose the ``flexibility and diversity'' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions.
The British government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form. It argues, as does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unice</ENAMEX>, that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> will propose a slightly watered-down version of the charter to be discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> social-affairs ministers on Monday, officials said. But the cosmetic changes aren't expected to win over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. ``We still have serious differences with the text,'' a British official said, because it provides for a ``regulation of the labor market.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> said the charter would put poorer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> countries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal</ENAMEX> at a disadvantage. It would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours, and provide for collective bargaining and worker ``participation'' in major corporate decisions.
This, he warned, would prevent these countries from bridging the difference with their richer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> brethren. Indeed, lower wages -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, they are a third of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> average -- aren't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries. Increasing labor costs, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> argued, would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> market planned for after 1992.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unice</ENAMEX> official said that producing a charter acceptable to both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and European industry isn't an unattainable goal. The charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers' fundamental rights, without seeking to impose any norms.
A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate to produce an ``action program'' detailing on what points <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter. This provision lies at the heart of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British and Unice</ENAMEX> fears of ``social engineering'' by the commission.
One possible political solution, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> official said, would be for the commission to present the action program in late November, before the adoption of the charter at a summit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> governments on Dec. 8 and 9. This would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program.
The charter was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC Commission</ENAMEX> on Sept. 21. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s Socialist government, which currently holds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX>'s rotating presidency, is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 EC states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the French revolution and its ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</ENAMEX>
