If any South Korean businessman knows how tough it is to make money in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Young-Jin</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> is president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo Corp.</ENAMEX>, the only South Korean company that has invested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> to date -- an investment that took more than eight years to make.
Earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX> -- the world's biggest furrier, with 1988 sales of $319.4 million -- received approval from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> to send $400,000 to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> to capitalize an equally owned joint fur venture. The other partner is a private Soviet-American concern, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interlink Cooperative</ENAMEX>.
The new venture, Jindo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rus Cooperative</ENAMEX>, plans to open its first sales outlet, a retail fur shop, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intourist Hotel</ENAMEX> later this month if Soviet bureaucratic obstacles can finally be overcome. The shop's opening has been delayed twice. The venture now awaits <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s approval of procedures for handling international credit-card payment for the fur purchases.
Despite the problems, and the relatively small size of his investment, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> has big plans for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo Rus</ENAMEX>. He said he hopes to:
-- Recoup <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jindo</ENAMEX>'s outlay within a year.
-- Have at least 10 shops in Soviet cities and airports by
-- Set up a fur-production factory as early as next year.
-- Diversify into other lines of Soviet business, including trading in textiles, syringes and condoms.
But for all his plans, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> has no illusions about doing business with the Soviets. His ambitions are tempered by the long road Jindo has trod to get as far as it has.
For years, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jindo</ENAMEX>, a 25-year veteran of the fur business, bought its raw furs from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scandinavia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> The company knew that many of those pelts originated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and had been bought at the semiannual <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leningrad</ENAMEX> fur auction. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> longed to buy directly from the auction, the world's oldest and most famous fur sale, but for years that was impossible. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> had no diplomatic relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Koreans</ENAMEX> weren't welcome at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leningrad</ENAMEX> auction.
Even after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korea Trade Promotion Corp.</ENAMEX>, the state-owned company promoting Korean exports abroad, began quiet dealings with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern European</ENAMEX> countries in the early 1980s, there were two nuts it couldn't crack: the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Korea</ENAMEX>. That slowly began to change in the early 1980s.
In 1981, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX> surreptitiously began dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leningrad Auction Co.</ENAMEX> behind the backs of both the Korean and Soviet governments. At first, the fur company dealt through two U.S. agents, spending a few million dollars at the fair each year.
But in 1984, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jindo</ENAMEX>, through its U.S. agents, began to push for a direct invitation to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leningrad</ENAMEX>, where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX> experts could see all the pelts on offer and make their own selection. It was slow going, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> said. ``The Soviets already knew about Jindo and were interested in us. But they were wary of getting involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Koreans</ENAMEX>.''
Later that year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX> got its break. At the end of that year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> recalled, a hush-hush meeting was held at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Savoy Hotel</ENAMEX> between him and the head of a Soviet fur company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sojuzpushnina</ENAMEX>. The meeting was secret ``because at that time, according to the Korean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, I wasn't supposed to meet these kinds of people,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> said, adding that he pressed the Soviet executive hard to get an invitation and visa to attend the auction.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX>'s timing was good. In early 1985, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> came to power in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> and soon introduced his glasnost and perestroika policies. Still, it took Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> 10 months to get the visa to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leningrad</ENAMEX>. In October 1985, he made his first visit to the auction, and was the top buyer on the floor. He spent $10 million on pelts, deliberately pushing up purchase prices ``to make a good impression,'' but also, he said, getting a bargain for Jindo as the price he paid was 10% less than the world market price.
Altogether, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX> has spent $27.4 million buying pelts directly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, making Jindo the country's top fur customer. And the company has exported to the Soviets, in a barter arrangement, fur-lined raincoats valued at $814,000.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX> has much bigger plans. As soon as his foot was in the Soviet door, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> started pushing for a permanent Jindo presence. What he wanted was a piece of the immense earnings potential of Soviet-finished fur exports. That, he proposed last year, could be achieved only through a joint venture entailing direct Jindo investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, a daring suggestion at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> economic relations remained strained.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX>'s financial strength and willingness to flout taboos wasn't lost on the Soviets. A meeting was arranged between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> and the Soviet minister for light industries, who asked Jindo to help run a fur factory outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>.
``That one factory was producing and selling about 900 million rubles a year -- $1.2 billion at that time -- in fur hats, collars, jackets and coats,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX>. And that was for the Soviet domestic market alone. But when he saw the factory, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> said, he was shocked. ``You have no idea how bad the fur garments were. And very expensive. About $300 average for a hat that in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> would cost about $50.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> said that the day after his factory tour, he told the Soviet minister that the factory was so inefficient and the products so bad, that any hopes of exports were doomed. Instead of reforming the factory's operations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX>'s president proposed building a new, smaller factory as a pilot joint-venture project.
The Soviets agreed reluctantly, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX>, but the deal fell through earlier this year when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX> tired of being obstructed by bureaucrats. ``We discovered that these people don't have any idea at all, no mentality, for a private company,'' he said. ``For example, if you need a nail, you can't just buy it. You have to complete a voucher for the nail, then wait one month or longer to have it filled. The whole country is like that.''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jindo</ENAMEX> wasn't giving up on its dream of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet-Korean</ENAMEX> fur partnership. Last March, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim</ENAMEX> signed a joint-venture agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Schwalbe</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> businessman, who already was in partnership with some Soviet entrepreneurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Interlink</ENAMEX>, a private <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>-based company. The agreement, costing each side $400,000 in initial capital, established Jindo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jindo</ENAMEX> also bought a 10% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interlink</ENAMEX> for $32,500.
