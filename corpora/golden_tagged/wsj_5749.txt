It was some entrepreneur's big opportunity: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> scientists already had worked on the problem for 15 years. The researchers had spent over $3 million before results of the first animal tests emerged. And now, they had developed a method to inhibit cataract formation in eyes.
At this point, such a project often falters. Commercializing such university research frequently proves slow and frustrating, and opportunities are missed. But in this case, a team of special MIT licensing executives quickly helped round up investors and encouraged formation of a new company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oculon Inc.</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>, to make its fortune off the research. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> and its scientists working on the project all get a share of the action.
These days, many universities and nonprofit research institutions are scrambling -- often with limited success -- to commercialize their research. But in the past three years alone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> has helped professors and others start over 50 companies, all aiming to turn the fruits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> research into cash.
Traditionally, the world of university research has had trouble connecting with the world of money to commercialize research. (Indeed, many academics say such efforts aren't in keeping with a university's commitment to pure research.) Until it radically changed its methods three years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> also suffered its share of frustrations -- even though its laboratories are world-famous and its research budget exceeds $700 million a year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> gets results these days because it can ``understand the demands of business and the investment community and link them with the needs of scientists,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Clark</ENAMEX>, a scientist and one of the founders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oculon</ENAMEX>.
For starters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> invests heavily in patents -- sometimes over $50,000 to get world-wide coverage. It helps its own scientists form new companies and recruit investors. And it routinely acts as a ``high-tech yenta'' to introduce patents and research to potential investors, an official says.
The start-up companies receive a license to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>'s technology and agree to a timetable for developing it; in return, the institute gets a small stake and royalties from sales.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oculon</ENAMEX> case, the institute first filed several patents. Then its licensing executives began to explore a business use for the results. With all the work that already had been done, ``we began to look for the best way to transfer that technology,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Preston</ENAMEX>, head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> licensing office. After polling a number of potential investors and licensees, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> decided that a start-up would be the best way to exploit the technology.
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> and physics professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Benedek</ENAMEX>, an early researcher on the project, negotiated $5 million in financing from investors, the licensing office drafted an agreement that would give MIT a stake in the company and a share of future sales.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> was extremely valuable in contacting venture-capital sources. They knew who to contact and who would be interested,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark</ENAMEX> says. ``They also helped us educate investors about the long-term nature of the project and what the potential obstacles could be.''
It wasn't always this way. In the early 1980s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> scientists complained that the university's licensing operation was staffed by bureaucratic lawyers who often became obstacles to good deals. Back in 1983, for example, when computer technologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Hillis</ENAMEX> wanted the university to file patents for his designs for a sophisticated computer he had developed at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>, the licensing office balked. It was so indecisive, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillis</ENAMEX> says, that he filed the patents himself and launched his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thinking Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> with about $8 million from private investors.
But in 1986, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> restaffed its licensing office with executives who themselves had been entrepreneurs or worked in entrepreneurial businesses. The institute gave the  licensing group broad guidelines and autonomy to run the licensing operations. Today, the office of six professionals handles six to eight times as many start-ups as in the early 1980s, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> says.
As part of its new approach, the licensing group re-established relations with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillis</ENAMEX> and formally licensed the technology to him. In return, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> has a small stake and a share of royalties of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thinking Machines.</ENAMEX> Last year, the computer company had revenue of more than $40 million.
``The one reason they've been so successful is because they concentrate on ways to get the technology out,'' says entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Chubb</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matritech Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cambridge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, start-up involved with new ways to detect cancer.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Matritech</ENAMEX>'s case, MIT even helped the company find management. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> biologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheldon Penman</ENAMEX> and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> researcher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Fey</ENAMEX> had developed Matritech's basic technology, which uses antibodies to detect proteins within cells. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chubb</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> for a license to develop the technology in a new venture. Besides agreeing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> helped the company find $3.5 million in venture capital as well as managers to develop the business. In most MIT projects that develop into start-ups, scientists such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penman</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fey</ENAMEX> don't actually run the company, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lita Nelson</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> licensing official. In fact, she says, university policy prohibits faculty members from being line officers in any company. Most of the scientists, however, continue to work with the companies as consultants, receive royalties and own small stakes as well.
In some instances, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> also combines its technology with that of others to form new companies. Take the launch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enzytech Inc.</ENAMEX>, which uses enzymes and polymers in food additives and drug delivery. The initial research was conducted simultaneously by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Hospital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>. In 1987, the two institutions licensed their technologies to a start-up formed expressly for commercialization. And venture capitalists put in over $5 million to keep the company going.
Many venture capitalists say the projects at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> are much more ``state-of-the-market'' than at other universities. Says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> venture capitalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Nazem</ENAMEX>, ``It's a good place to get new technology.''
In 1986, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nazem</ENAMEX> was the first investor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cirrus Logic Inc.</ENAMEX>, which grew out of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nazem</ENAMEX>'s $2.5 million investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milpitas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, maker of high-performance chips has a market value today of nearly $28 million.
