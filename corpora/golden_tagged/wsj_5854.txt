<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p. A.</ENAMEX> said it is reorganizing its international commodity trading operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, two months after being forced to liquidate multimillion dollar soybean futures positions at a loss on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX>.
The Italian conglomerate said it named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Romano Venturi</ENAMEX>, managing director of the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi Italia</ENAMEX> unit, head of the new trading operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> also said that as part of the restructuring the trading unit would work more closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX>'s agricultural businesses, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Soya</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> soybean processor it purchased in 1987.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> confirmed that three officers of Ferruzzi <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> have announced their resignations as a result of the reorganizations. The three, as previously reported, are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolland Gagliardini</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gleeson</ENAMEX>, the former head of trading and the top trader in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, respectively, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Elbaz</ENAMEX>, another trader.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> was at the center of an international trading controversy in July when it lost a showdown with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Trade</ENAMEX> and was forced to sell off huge futures holdings that called for the delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferruzzi</ENAMEX> has denied that its traders were trying to manipulate soybean futures and cash prices upward by holding such a large futures position.
