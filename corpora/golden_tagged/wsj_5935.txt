The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> said it has taken over litigation of a whistleblower's lawsuit alleging fraud by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairchild Control Systems Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matra</ENAMEX>
The government charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairchild Control</ENAMEX>, a former division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairchild Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>, deliberately sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> defective devices used to test the transfer of fuel from jet fighters' spare tanks. The devices were supposed to eliminate the need for inflight tests of the tanks.
Actual damages haven't been established, but penalties for the alleged false claims alone could exceed $1 million, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> said. The original suit was filed in July 1988 by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Aliksanian</ENAMEX>, who had been a program manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fairchild Control</ENAMEX> until September 1987.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matra</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the company hasn't received the lawsuit and officials won't comment until they can review it.
