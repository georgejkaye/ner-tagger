<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doskocil Cos.</ENAMEX> said its planned sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson Foods Corp.</ENAMEX>'s fresh and retail meats business to an affiliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peck Foods Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> has been terminated.
The $140 million transaction was to have been completed Sept. 30. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David S. Smoak</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doskocil</ENAMEX>, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WFC Acquisition Corp.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peck</ENAMEX> affiliate, had informed him that its planned financing had fallen through. He said he received no ``substantive'' reason for the loss of financing.

``It's hurt us a lot,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoak</ENAMEX>, who added that nearly three months of uncertainty about the sale had been ``just devastating to our business.'' Partly as a result, he added, ``we expect terrible results in the third quarter, and we expect to spend the next quarter getting back to doing business and not doing asset sales.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoak</ENAMEX> said he doesn't know how bad the third quarter results will be, other than ``pretty bad.''
In the third quarter of 1988, the company earned $440,000, or eight cents a share, on sales of $44.8 million.
In a related development, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service Inc.</ENAMEX> downgraded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doskocil</ENAMEX>'s senior subordinated debt, due 1999, to single-B-3 from single-B-1 and the subordinated notes, due 1993, to single-B-2 from single-B-3.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doskocil</ENAMEX> has $144 million in long-term debt, of which $90 million remains from its purchase last year of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s stock outstanding. The sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s fresh and retail meat business would have retired that portion of the debt, which includes a $65 million paydown due Dec. 31.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WFC Acquisition</ENAMEX>, created specifically to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> properties, is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George N. Gillett Jr.</ENAMEX>, who also owns the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vail</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, ski resort and numerous broadcast and food processing properties. Recently, however, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> has run into financial problems with his 55% share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI Television Inc.</ENAMEX>, for which he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</ENAMEX> paid $1.2 billion in a 1987 leveraged buy-out -- a purchase price that was 14.7 times operating cash flow.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
About the same time that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCI</ENAMEX> began having difficulty meeting debt payments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WFC</ENAMEX> agreed to pay $140 million in cash for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> properties, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoak</ENAMEX>. But on Aug. 8, he said, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WFC</ENAMEX> signed an amended agreement to pay $150 million (plus warrants) for the property -- $110 million in cash and $40 million in subordinated notes. Yesterday, the entire package fell through.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doskocil</ENAMEX> would have retained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s delicatessen and food service businesses had the sale gone through. It closed in national over-the-counter trading yesterday at $8, down $1.625.
