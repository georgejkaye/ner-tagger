Fifteen months after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American International Group</ENAMEX> agreed to become the anchor tenant in a major development proposed for downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, the company has changed its mind.
The insurance company will remain in its lower Manhattan headquarters, where expansion space has recently become available, and look for another Manhattan location as well.
By not relocating 2,000 employees to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AIG</ENAMEX> has slowed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>'s efforts to develop boroughs other than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIG</ENAMEX>'s decision, based in part on the softening value of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> real estate, spotlights a trend that may be beneficial to the city in the long run.
``A little slowdown in the real estate market in terms of price escalation can be good for business because it makes firms stay and grow,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Hedman</ENAMEX>, senior managing director at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward S. Gordon</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> real estate services firm.
Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Lynford</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reis Reports</ENAMEX>, a real estate market research firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>: ``We're seeing the positive flip side of the decline of real estate values in the aftermath of October 1987. People tended to dwell on employee cutbacks, office vacancies and a decline in rents, without considering the positive impact these can have on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s long range competitiveness.''
According to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> rents have declined an average of $2 a square foot, with most of the drop in lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. But the real change is in the value of concession packages landlords give tenants. Owners typically give tenants a free rent period and money toward interior improvements, a package worth between about 12% and 18% of the asking rent. There's been an increase of five to seven percentage points in the value of those concessions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynford</ENAMEX> says.
Worries that corporations would flee <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> began at the beginning of the decade, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lynford</ENAMEX> explains. Experts feared average rental prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> office space would reach $60 a square foot by 1984. Today average office rents in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> are $37 a square foot. Companies moving just across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson</ENAMEX> rivers an can expect to pay between $15 and $20 a square foot for office space.
Companies that would have felt pressure to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, or out of the metropolitan area are willing to pay the smaller premium to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. Many businesses that might have been expected to flee older properties in the financial district for midtown are either renewing leases or remaining in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> area because rents are more reasonable.
The latter is particularly true of law firms -- the biggest space user in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> -- because partners' incomes are directly affected by the firm's bottom line. Among those law firms that have remained in lower Manhattan are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winthrop</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stimson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Putnam & Roberts; Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carter Ledyard & Milburn.</ENAMEX>
In a soft market, landlords and tenants are more eager to make deals. ``The good landlords who understand how things work in the long run want to button down their buildings,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard P. Malloy</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helmsley-Spear Inc.</ENAMEX> He says some owners have extended leases well before their expiration date for the security of having a long-term tenant.
Industry analysts estimate there are about 11 million square feet of vacant office space in lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, up from about six million in 1988. Much of that space is in older buildings, out of sync with the needs of computerized financial services tenants.
Companies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIG</ENAMEX>, however, are finding they can make do in renovated older buildings. The firm scuttled its plans to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> for a number of reasons, including financial pressures within the company and the insurance industry. In addition, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mccann</ENAMEX>, the company's vice president of real estate, ``In the past year or six months, the market has softened so much downtown that we're looking at alternatives in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. As a tenant, he says, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> real estate market provides ``a virtual feast.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Muss</ENAMEX>, the developer of the $165 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Plaza</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIG</ENAMEX> was to be a tenant, says the project can still go forward. But the company's pullout last week prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> to withdraw its $6 million grant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance Plaza</ENAMEX> has been designed to include a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hilton Hotel</ENAMEX> and a 30-story office building.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> is now likely to step up efforts to lure companies to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queens</ENAMEX> with tax and energy price cuts. ``It will become more important to provide incentives to companies who are considering all the alternatives,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley E. Grayson</ENAMEX>, deputy mayor for economic development. ``Many won't go without these programs.
