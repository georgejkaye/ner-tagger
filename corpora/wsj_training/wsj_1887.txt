<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates International Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Garden City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> said they agreed to jointly develop software to help manage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vax</ENAMEX> computers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30% and more each year. The market for system-management software for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Associates</ENAMEX> should do well there.
At the same time, the market is smaller than the market for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>-compatible software. For one thing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maynard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, has sold fewer machines. In addition, its machines are typically easier to operate, so customers require less assistance from software.
