A man from the Bush administration came before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Agriculture Committee</ENAMEX> yesterday to talk about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s intention to send some $100 million in food aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, with more to come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>. The committee's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s own farmers. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Ackerman</ENAMEX> noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Salvador</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX>. However well intentioned, food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country's own farmers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First World</ENAMEX> has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness. It should be constantly stressed that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s farmers mostly need a real market for their products.
