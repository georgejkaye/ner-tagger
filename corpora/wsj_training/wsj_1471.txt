Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Whitten</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss.</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> proposed a $2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s recovery from last week's earthquake and extend further aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> victims of Hurricane Hugo.
The sweeping measure incorporates $500 million in small-business loans, $1 billion in highway-construction funds and $1.25 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters. The funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to keep most of the government operating past Wednesday.
The measure is scheduled to be taken up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> today. The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Business Administration</ENAMEX>. ``We will support it, we will thank him, and we will augment it where appropriate,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vic Fazio</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>).
Dubbed the ``Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Natural Disasters of National Significance</ENAMEX>,'' the measure is vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitten</ENAMEX> in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments. ``Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required,'' the legislation reads, and the new obligations ``shall not be a charge against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> Act, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, or other ceilings.
