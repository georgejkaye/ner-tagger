<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>'s domestic auto sales jumped almost 50% in the first eight months of this year, while exports plunged more than 40%, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade and Industry Ministry</ENAMEX> reported.
Officials said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyundai Motor Co.</ENAMEX> and four other manufacturers sold a combined 475,407 motor vehicles, including cars and trucks, during the January-to-August period. The increase in sales was attributed mainly to rising personal income among <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Koreans</ENAMEX>.
The five auto makers exported 207,547 motor vehicles, mostly cars, during the eight months. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry</ENAMEX> officials blamed the 40% export decline on reduced shipments to the U.S. caused both by labor disputes affecting South Korean auto makers and sluggish U.S. demand for Korean cars.
