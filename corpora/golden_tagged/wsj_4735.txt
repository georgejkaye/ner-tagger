The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> rejected a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> bid to restore cuts from fiscal 1990 appropriations for the D-5 Trident missile and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Defense Initiative</ENAMEX>.
The 66-34 roll call represents a significant defeat for SDI and puts pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> negotiators to move closer to the lower authorized funding level approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>. The fate of the D-5 remains unclear, but the impact of last night's vote is to let stand a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Appropriations Committee</ENAMEX> decision to withhold all new procurement money for the troubled weapon system.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDI</ENAMEX> is a perishable commodity and it is going downhill on both sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Nunn</ENAMEX>, who backed the restoration of funds but said he hadn't crafted the specific amendment. ``It's a big pot of money,'' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Democrat</ENAMEX>, ``and the goals are elusive and vague.''
The administration fared better on two separate issues as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> rejected, 7129, an effort to withhold production funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX>'s B-2 bomber, and on a 65-34 roll call, senators effectively blocked a proposal that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> troop strength in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> be cut by 3,000.
The action came as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> approved major revisions adding almost $8.5 billion to a $279.6 billion spending bill funding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> through the new fiscal year beginning Sunday. Although the modified bill represents a 2% increase above current appropriations, in judging where to spend the additional funds, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> found itself in competition with the appropriations panel.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> contractors lobbied alongside arms control advocates in the hallways outside the chamber, and the parliamentary situation forced conservative Republicans to choose in some cases between SDI and expenditures on space programs and conventional weapons important to interests at home.
Among the biggest beneficiaries of the competition was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX>, manufacturer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s Apache helicopter, and almost $1.49 billion is allocated for various shipbuilding accounts, including a major initiative to expand the military's sealift capacity.
Sufficient SDI funding is preserved to allow the space-based anti-missile program to keep pace with inflation. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> appropriations level -- $3.7 billion -- is estimated to be $600 million below the amount first authorized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> this year. Even the GOP amendment yesterday sought only to restore about half, or $298.4 million, of this cut, and similarly, the panel proposed adding back only half of $1.8 billion initially requested by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> for D-5 procurement.
The defense debate came as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> gave quick approval to back-to-back fiscal 1990 bills covering U.S. foreign assistance as well as the Departments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor, Education</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">and Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>. The action ends an impasse that has prolonged the entire appropriations process, but with just days left in the current fiscal year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has no expectation of reaching agreement on the bulk of fiscal 1990 spending before the deadline Sunday.
By a 274-152 margin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> yesterday approved a stopgap measure to keep the government operating through Oct. 25. This is expected to become the new deadline for resolving a host of budgetary issues complicated by the certain threat of at least a temporary across-the-board spending cut under the Gramm-Rudman deficit law.
The nearly $14.4 billion foreign-assistance bill, approved 89-11, includes an estimated $100 million in economic aid and guarantees for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, and authorizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overseas Private Investment Corp.</ENAMEX> to begin operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>.
The massive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor, Education and Health and Human Services</ENAMEX> bill, adopted 81-19, allocates more than $140 billion among major social and medical programs, including a 30% increase for research and treatment activities for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The measure also contains what amounts to down payments on promised initiatives for child care and federal aid for elementary public-school students from lower-income families.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> action came as negotiators neared an agreement that would clear the way for lawmakers to consider a $3.1 billion anti-drug initiatve, adding $900 million to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s proposals for fiscal 1990 and imposing an 0.43% cut on defense and domestic accounts. The remaining issue involved a procedure for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> consideration of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s legislative anti-crime package before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> quits for the year.
The anti-drug package, agreed to by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Democrats and the Bush administration, includes about $1 billion in new spending authority for federal prison construction, another approximately $1 billion for various treatment and prevention programs, about $806 million for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies, and about $120 million for the federal judiciary.
