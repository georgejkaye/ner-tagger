<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Newspapers Inc.</ENAMEX>, Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Quayle</ENAMEX>'s family's publishing business, joined a trend among newspaper chains by going public but keeping control in family hands.
More than three million shares were snapped up yesterday, as the oversubscribed issue opened at $22.75, although it had been priced at $21. The stock closed its first day of composite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading at $23.50, up 75 cents, on volume of 1.6 million shares. Based on the closing price, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> would have a market value of $607 million.
The sale represented less than 16% of the company's Class A common shares, most of which will remain in family hands. More important, nearly all of the Class B shares, which have 10 times the voting power of the Class A shares, still are held by the family.
Other U.S. newspaper publishers with similar arrangements include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcclatchy Newspapers Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones & Co.</ENAMEX>, publisher of this newspaper.
Central decided to offer the public a minority stake to create liquidity in the stock, and to establish a market price. For selling shareholders the result was a windfall.
The biggest seller was tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franklin College</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Franklin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, which disposed of 1.3 million of its 1.52 million shares -- more than doubling its endowment fund in the process. Before the offering ``we had valued all the shares that we owned at roughly $4 million,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid Downey</ENAMEX>, the school's vice president of finance. The 885-student school is expected to receive about $27 million in proceeds.
Other selling shareholders included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Depauw University</ENAMEX>, the vice president's alma mater, which sold 181,818 of its 300,000 shares; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty Fund Inc.</ENAMEX>, a nonprofit foundation set up by a businessman who helped finance the newspapers.
While the vice president wasn't among family members selling shares, two brothers and a sister were, as was their mother. His office said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> continues to hold 19,800 shares of Class A and 25,000 shares of Class <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. His</ENAMEX> wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn</ENAMEX>, holds 8,000 Class A shares.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> has two daily newspaper monopolies, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, and also owns several smaller dailies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>. Unlike many media companies, however, it has no non-newspaper holdings.
Analysts said investors' initial enthusiasm for the stock may be based more on the company's potential than recent results. ``Their profit margins are considerably below industry averages,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Morton</ENAMEX>, an analyst with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynch, Jones & Ryan</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. He calculated that while the average operating margin for comparable companies is 16.5%, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>'s for the last 12 months was 12.7%
But ``there are some obvious opportunities for them to improve that,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX> said. He noted that both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> papers publish morning and evening editions with separate editorial staffs. ``Even without collapsing down to one newspaper a day they could save some money. I'd expect they would follow the trend and go to once-a-day publication.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>'s offering prospectus reported that earnings for the 26 weeks ended last June 25 were $19.8 million on revenue of $216.3 million. That compares with net income of $15.4 million on revenue of $207.7 million a year earlier.
But the document also discloses that fiscal 1988's earnings were slightly less than that for the previous year before a change in accounting. During the latest year Central took a $7.6 million charge for workforce reductions at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> dailies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona Republic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix Gazette</ENAMEX>. That reduction came as advertising linage declined, reflecting a slump in the housing market and the loss of some major retailers.
The company was founded in 1934 by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene C. Pulliam</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX>'s grandfather. The Vice President's father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James C. Quayle</ENAMEX>, is a director of the company.
A majority of the Class B common stock is held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eugene C. Pulliam Trust</ENAMEX>, which is to terminate 21 years after the death of certain family descendants. According to mortality tables, that would be in 2060, the prospectus says.
As a final reminder that the company clearly remains in family hands, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> chose a fitting trading symbol for its stock: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECP</ENAMEX> -- in honor of its founder.
