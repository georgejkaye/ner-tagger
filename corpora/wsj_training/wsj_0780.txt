<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Leigh-Pemberton</ENAMEX> urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs.
``Caution should... be the rule of the day,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh-Pemberton</ENAMEX> in a speech to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of Corporate Treasurers</ENAMEX>' annual dinner. ``It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general, to say nothing of banks, if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions.''
His remarks were distributed to the press before Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> announced his resignation last evening. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of England</ENAMEX> officials said the central bank had no comment on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX>'s resignation.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leigh-Pemberton</ENAMEX> reiterated that the exposure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> banks to leveraged deals haven't yet reached ``worrying levels.'' However, in light of the risks involved in such transactions, banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions, he said.
In other comments, he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy. ``A similar result could sometimes be achieved, at less cost, by changing managements,'' he said.
