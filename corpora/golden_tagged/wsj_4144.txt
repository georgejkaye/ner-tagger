British entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Branson</ENAMEX> plans to take on a Japanese partner in a venture to expand the international operations of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin Music Group</ENAMEX> recording business.
At a news conference today, the flamboyant Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX> is expected to announce a Japanese investment of more than # 100 million ($161 million) in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virgin Music</ENAMEX>, the world's sixth-biggest recording company. A spokesman for the unit of closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin Group PLC</ENAMEX> confirmed that a Japanese partnership is planned, but declined to identify the investor group or to provide further details.
A spokesman for a major Japanese record company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pony Canyon Inc.</ENAMEX>, said the company is among a consortium of companies acquiring Virgin stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pony Canyon</ENAMEX> purchased the stock last week. The spokesman declined to comment further.
The partnership is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX>'s long-awaited response to a merger wave sweeping the world recording industry that threatens Virgin's continued prosperity.
Since January, several ``independent'' record labels have been snatched up by industry giants racing each other for global market share. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorn</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI PLC</ENAMEX> bought 50% of rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysalis Records</ENAMEX> for # 46.2 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motown Records</ENAMEX> went for $61 million to a group including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.V. Philips</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram</ENAMEX> unit swallowed up reggae-and-rock producer Island Records for roughly $300 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram</ENAMEX> is also negotiating to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&M Records</ENAMEX> at a price analysts expect to be around $500 million. Behind these mergers has been the big companies' growing need to stoke their tape, record and compact-disk factories with a steady stream of hits.
In this industry mating dance, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX> had hitherto been the most prominent wallflower. His music business, with sales of approximately $400 million in the year ended last July 31, is considered by industry analysts as too small to continue competing alone against the industry's bigger giants. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virgin Music</ENAMEX>, begun in 1970, is the oldest and largest part of the diversified airline, entertainment and retailing empire that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX> has gradually assembled and that he has said he intends to keep independent.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX> apparently sees a Japanese partner as a way to tap more cash without ceding complete management control. ``We don't want to link up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Five</ENAMEX> {in recording}, but we also want to be in a position not to be squeezed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Five</ENAMEX>,'' one Virgin source said. The world's five largest recording companies are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warner Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, recently merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Records</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polygram</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bertelsmann AG</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA Records</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorn</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMI.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, the source indicated, isn't Virgin's unnamed Japanese partner.
A Japanese partnership will strengthen Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX>'s rapidly growing ties to that country. His Virgin <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Airways</ENAMEX> flies between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gatwick Airport</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. Virgin Music sells its Western pop and rock recordings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and also records some Japanese musicians. Another Virgin unit distributes Japanese home video games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>.
The Japanese investment also represents the biggest change in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branson</ENAMEX>'s capital structure since he retreated from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
