Government efforts to hammer the dollar lower shook the stock and bond markets, pushing prices down sharply.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average tumbled 22.42 points to 2659.19, albeit in light trading. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s benchmark 30-year bond lost more than a point, or over $10 for every $1,000 face amount.
Analysts said the overall declines in the financial markets are symptomatic of the relatively high prices that stocks and bonds have reached in recent months. ``We're really on a razor's edge with regard to valuation,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby Joseph Cohen</ENAMEX>, a market strategist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert.</ENAMEX> Investors' ``happy view of the dollar is being shaken, and that's reverberating through the bond and stock markets.''
The rout came after a weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the major industrialized nations. The joint statement from the meeting declared that the dollar's recent strength is ``inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals.'' The central banks backed up the statement with concerted intervention beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and continuing through the trading day in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, sending the dollar spiraling downward.
The dollar's dive spooked bond traders early in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> trading session. Bond traders said the battle to push the dollar lower seems to have heated up, and there isn't a clear view of how much lower the U.S. currency will be forced. Fears of further dollar declines were fanned when West German <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bundesbank</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Otto Poehl</ENAMEX> said the dollar's plunge was consistent with the intentions of the finance ministers and central bankers.
But the fight on the currency front wasn't the only problem for bond prices. Surprisingly strong mid-September auto sales suggested that the economy may be reaccelerating. That would eliminate any economic incentive the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> might have to allow interest rates to fall. However, some analysts cautioned that the auto sales may be a temporary phenomenon as consumers scurry to purchase 1989 models before the pricier 1990 models flood dealer lots.
In any case, the weaker bond market took its toll on stock prices. Although trading volume was thin, the decline on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> was broadly based, with 1,031 issues declining and only 445 rising. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham</ENAMEX>'s Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said stock prices are at a sufficiently high level that they can't tolerate a rise in interest rates. Yet she said that with the dollar declining and a flood of new debt issues about to come to market, higher interest rates seem very likely.
``It's very, very hard to construct any kind of bullish case right now,'' she said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones Transportation Average</ENAMEX> took a hard hit, too. It lost 20.09 points to 1428.17 after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> story reported that Transportation Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> asked for a reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX>' investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX>, the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> and other government officials have expressed concern about the levels of debt and foreign influence in recent airline takeovers.
In major market activity:
Stock prices fell in thin trading. Volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> totaled 121.1 million shares.
Bond prices tumbled. The yield on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s benchmark 30-year issue rose to 8.29%.
