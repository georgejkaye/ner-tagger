<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Inc.</ENAMEX> -- have been secretly attempting to form a consortium to sell securities price information.
The talks, initiated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and held over the past six to nine months, could have major implications for the dissemination of the world's stock, bond, currency and commodities-related price quotations.
Wall Street executives familiar with the discussions say the four firms are trying to restore some of their diminishing control over the flow of electronic market data. These big firms, and others, have been growing increasingly defensive about losing their traditional grip on such information -- as well as some of the revenue from producing it -- as independent electronic services grow more powerful.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon S. Corzine</ENAMEX>, a senior partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX>, confirmed that he and his counterparts at the three other Wall Street firms are discussing a joint venture to pool market data, but he declined to comment specifically. ``We're still at an early stage,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corzine</ENAMEX> said.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment specifically on talks it is having with other firms. ``We are continuously involved in discussions with people inside and outside the industry on the uses of technology,'' he said.
Spokesmen at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX>, which is 62%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express Co.</ENAMEX>, declined to comment.
Any joint project from the four firms would be at least months away, said an executive familiar with the discussions. But he said the firms have already shelled out $5 million each, which one participant in the talks called ``seed money.''
The four securities firms are particularly concerned about the $4 trillion global bond market. Bond data once was nearly impossible to get outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>, but is now readily available through high-tech vendors of prices and market analysis, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg Financial Markets</ENAMEX>, which was created eight years ago. Control of information about securities prices used to give the big firms a valuable edge in trading bonds and stocks and setting trading commissions.
But terminals provided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg company</ENAMEX>, which is 30%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>, are now being used world-wide by securities firms, institutional investors and central banks. The Bloomberg system has become a major pipeline for the world's bond market data among sophisticated investors. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>, in particular, has aroused the concern of big Wall Street firms.
At a recent dinner meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley's</ENAMEX> executive dining room, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corzine</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> joined high-level Wall Street bond market executives, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Mack</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> vice chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard S. Fuld Jr.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> managing directors <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas W. Brock</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard F. Leahy</ENAMEX>, according to individuals familiar with the meeting.
There were immediate ego and technical problems to deal with. ``It was like trying to shepherd a group of wild animals into a straight line,'' said one of the participants, who asked not to be named.
The Bloomberg system was created by former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> partner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Bloomberg</ENAMEX>, who was a big trader and a technology specialist. Executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and the other firms insist they aren't out to ``get'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>. But one participant in a recent meeting notes a growing fear that ``if he becomes big enough, the key market-making  firms will become just players in the system.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> all see independent electronic vendors making money from information that derives from the firms and their trading desks. In the future, the firms see themselves getting more into the electronic publishing business just as entrepreneurs such as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX> have.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX> says he isn't ruffled by potential competition from these large firms. ``Customers, who are the buy side, don't want to be beholden to a system owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>, the sell side,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>. ``Customers prefer to have a system that is independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street.</ENAMEX>''
The product the Wall Street firms envision would threaten any of several competing services, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>'s Quotron unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters Holdings PLC</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate Inc.</ENAMEX> However, one of these other services could get a slice of the action if it is tapped as an electronic vendor to distribute it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and Quotron have already had discussions about such an arrangement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> executives said. And a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> spokesman said he was contacted just last week by a consultant claiming to be working for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon</ENAMEX> and other firms. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> is 67%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones & Co.</ENAMEX>, publisher of The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> has launched a tender offer to buy the remaining 33%.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telerate</ENAMEX> spokesman said the Wall Street firms discussing an electronic system will need a distributor, and ``we'd be happy to talk to see if there are any synergies for both sides.
