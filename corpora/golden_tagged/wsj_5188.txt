A federal court jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> unit should pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto Co.</ENAMEX> $21.1 million for breach of contract.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX>, a drug and chemical concern, had claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil Oil Corp.</ENAMEX> violated a five-year agreement to buy phosphorous products; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> had contended that the purchase agreements had been negated when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> sold certain plants in 1985.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company disagrees with the verdict, but won't make a decision on whether to appeal until the trial judge issues a formal order. Such orders can differ from the jury's finding. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil</ENAMEX> said it couldn't immediately determine whether a reserve had been established to cover the award payout.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> said it hasn't yet booked the award as revenue, and a spokesman, referring to the possibility of an appeal or other legal delay, said that ``we won't until we receive the check.
