Despite the chaos in the junk bond market and to the great relief of takeover-stock speculators, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> made good on its commitment to lend $230 million to an investor group that bought restaurant operator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerrico Inc.</ENAMEX> for about $470 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston Group</ENAMEX>, had agreed last month to make the temporary loan, known on Wall Street as a ``bridge loan'' because it is intended to be replaced within a few months by permanent financing through the sale of high-yield, low-rated junk bonds.
But because of last week's sharp price decline of many junk bonds, some takeover-stock speculators who had bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerrico</ENAMEX> shares and expected to resell them at a profit to the buy-out group feared that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> might delay the loan. The announcement yesterday that the buy-out group, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harlan Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, had accepted all shares of Jerrico that were tendered, came as a big relief to takeover-stock traders, or arbitragers.
``The fact that {the loan} did get funded in the middle of all the hullabaloo going on in the junk bond market was a good sign,'' said one arbitrager who declined to be identified.
Some arbitragers had feared that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> might be inclined to delay the transaction because the firm already had made about $1.7 billion of bridge loans to three other companies and has agreed to lend an additional $700 million as part of the pending $3.35 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical International Inc.</ENAMEX>
Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, however, said the arbitragers shouldn't have been worried. ``While the market may have been unsettled, this is the business we're in,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David M. Malcolm</ENAMEX>, a managing director involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s corporate finance and high-yield bond activities. ``We're ready, willing and able to do deals that make sense, and this deal makes sense,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arbitragers</ENAMEX> also had been concerned about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s willingness to lend to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerrico</ENAMEX> buy-out group because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> last year had made a bridge loan to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> and wasn't able to sell all the junk bonds necessary to repay the loan. Moreover, disclosures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s deepening financial troubles and the failure of one of its units to make an interest payment last week prompted much of the decline in junk bond prices.
And in August, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> had to pull back a proposed $475 million sale of junk bonds by a group that purchased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Mattress Co.</ENAMEX> because investors were unwilling to buy the bonds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> has lent $450 million to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Mattress</ENAMEX> group that won't be repaid until the bonds can be sold in a revised form.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> expects that most of the $230 million loan in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerrico</ENAMEX> transaction will be repaid with proceeds from the sale of junk bonds; the rest is expected to be repaid through a private placement of securities and a small amount of bank borrowings.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerrico</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lexington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ky.</ENAMEX>, operates the Long <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Silver</ENAMEX>'s seafood restaurant chain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerrico</ENAMEX> is being purchased by a unit of Long <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Silver</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>, which is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harlan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJS-Inverness & Co.</ENAMEX> Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle Harlan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJS Inverness</ENAMEX> have recently purchased other restaurants.
Including the assumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jerrico</ENAMEX> debt and fees and expenses, the total value of the transaction is estimated at about $620 million.
