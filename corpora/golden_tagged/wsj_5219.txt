<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaw Cellular Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kirkland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, said it extended its $5.96 billion, $110-a-share bid for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> until Oct. 13.
The offer was to expire today. As reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> agreed earlier this month to merge its domestic cellular telephone interests with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX> in a move aimed at thwarting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX>'s bid.
As part of that transaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX> will receive newly issued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> common shares representing a 50% stake after the merger. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX> might also receive some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> preferred stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> also plans to spin off its television broadcasting subsidiaries to stockholders and to pay its pre-merger stockholders a special cash dividend of $20 a share.
Some analysts had expected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX> to try to derail <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX>'s bid by raising its own offer, but so far <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX> has held firm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX> said 8.1 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> shares have been tendered under its offer; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> has more than 50 million shares outstanding.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> closed at $106.25 a share, up $1, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaw</ENAMEX> closed at $36 a share, down 25 cents.
