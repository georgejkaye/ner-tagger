<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reinaldo Ruiz</ENAMEX> sits in a tiny room set up for interviews in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami Correctional Center</ENAMEX>. The visitor's hall in this maximum-security prison is air-conditioned. But the adjoining interview room, in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX>, his lawyer and I barely fit, is not. Still, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> insists on keeping the door to the hot, airless room shut tight. Like most convicted drug smugglers who have given state's evidence, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> is afraid of reprisals.
Considering his long association with members of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>'s most ruthless drug cartel, his fears seem justified. However, the man Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> fears most is not Colombian. He's a man to whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> -- a Cuban-American with a large bearing and a graying beard -- bears a remarkable resemblance: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX>.
In March, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> traded testimony concerning his involvement with top-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> officials-cum-drug-traffickers for a significant reduction in his sentence (to 17 years from life imprisonment). While his testimony is considered highly reliable by federal investigators, the word of a convicted felon is always suspect. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX>'s accounts were recently corroborated by an unlikely source.
Testimony presented during this summer's dramatic drug trafficking and corruption trials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> -- in which some of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>'s top military and intelligence officials were tried and imprisoned or executed -- matches almost perfectly with statements made by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> on dates of shipments, amounts of payoffs, individuals involved, etc.
Some have suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> trials provide hope that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> is ready to help in the international effort to fight drug trafficking. However, the closely related <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> case shows the danger of cooperating with someone whose primary goal of totalitarian control outweighs all others, including drug interdiction or even loyalty to comrades. It also makes a strong case for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> to stick with its own strategy concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX>, rather than be pressured into acting on behalf of those who have shown faulty judgment about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>'s commitment to fighting the drug war.
If you look at a map of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, you will see that there's one unavoidable obstacle in the air space between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>. At least since the 1970s, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Customs planes have been forced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban Migs</ENAMEX> to halt their pursuit of drug-laden planes from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> as the latter fly over Cuba on the way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> But the evidence presented by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> showed a much more extensive Cuban involvement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> did not merely guarantee safety on overflights. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> provided U.S. prosecutors and drug-enforcement officials with extensive evidence of ground, sea and air cooperation involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> officials at the highest levels. Drugs were flown from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Varadero</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, where they were repackaged and sent by ship to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> mainland, all the while protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> coast guard, air force and intelligence officers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> and his son (a pilot who flew several of the missions) were meanwhile accorded VIP treatment on the island -- driving unescorted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Benzes</ENAMEX>, going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tropicana</ENAMEX> nightclub and, in the case of 51-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reinaldo</ENAMEX>, being allowed to marry a 21-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> and take her to the U.S.
Could Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX>'s highly visible operation have been missed by all but a relatively small group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubans</ENAMEX> -- namely those prosecuted by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>? ``You try to go anywhere near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> coastline without full authorization,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX>, ``and you'll see how many levels of authority are intertwined.'' In fact, the man responsible for protecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX>'s coastline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aldo Santamaria</ENAMEX>, was indicted in 1982 by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> court for trafficking. He was last seen as a member in good standing of the honor tribunal that condemned some of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> accomplices.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reinaldo Ruiz</ENAMEX> originally became associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> officials because of a chance meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> with his cousin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel Ruiz Poo</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz Poo</ENAMEX> was head of operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MC</ENAMEX>, the branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> intelligence designed to circumvent the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> embargo of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> through licit and illicit operations. The record is hazy as to who made the first move, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reinaldo</ENAMEX> -- who then had a Colombian girlfriend associated with drug lord <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pablo Escobar</ENAMEX> -- convinced his cousin that their various connections would converge nicely in a cocaine smuggling operation.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz Poo</ENAMEX> reported his smuggling plans to the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC</ENAMEX>, a highly decorated colonel named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio ``Tony</ENAMEX>'' de la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guardia</ENAMEX>. The operation was approved, and the first of several smuggling operations took place in early 1987.
Whether or not Col. de la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guardia</ENAMEX> informed his superiors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> operation, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> must have realized that the extent of detailed information obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> authorities through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> case required some response. A host of federal prosecutors, drug enforcement agents and even drug smugglers agree that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> trials were merely an attempt to isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX>'s involvement in drug trafficking to the one area about which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has irrefutable evidence. Of course, this is not to say that evidence collected before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> case was paltry. For years, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence agencies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Enforcement Agency</ENAMEX>, and even local law-enforcement officials have gathered volumes of less spectacular evidence about Cuban involvement in drug trafficking. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Merkel</ENAMEX>, a former U.S. Attorney in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX> who was instrumental in bringing indictments against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Noriega</ENAMEX> and Colombian drug lord <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Lehder</ENAMEX>, comments: ``We've had information on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>'s involvement dating back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lehder</ENAMEX>'s operations in the 1970s, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubans</ENAMEX> were paid off for overflights.... And every attempt to get Castro interested in our interdiction efforts failed.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Sanford</ENAMEX> was head of the Narcotics Conspiracy Unit out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>'s U.S. Attorney's office from 1975 to 1980. One of his biggest cases was against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>'s marijuana-smuggling kingpin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Alvero-Cruz</ENAMEX>. ``As of 1978, I was certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX> was deeply involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruz</ENAMEX> case,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> says.
Although ultimately convicted only on tax violations, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvero-Cruz</ENAMEX>'s relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> officials came out during the trial. After he allegedly bribed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> officials, boats laden with tons of marijuana from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jamaica</ENAMEX> were escorted safely along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> coastline by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> coast guard (the same tactics that led to the 1982 indictment of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adm</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santamaria)</ENAMEX>. In spite of being an alumnus of the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Castro</ENAMEX> Bay of Pigs invasion, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvero-Cruz</ENAMEX> had free access to the island fortress and on one occasion used a passport validated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> in 1976 to deposit money in one of his Madrid bank accounts. As the cases of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> and fugitive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Vesco</ENAMEX> also demonstrate, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubans</ENAMEX> have a long history of treating well-known drug smugglers like diplomats.
Despite these and many other accounts, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> has until quite recently steadfastly denied any Cuban involvement in drug trafficking. As recently as February of last year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> bristled when asked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Shriver</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX>'s role. ``Look, I believe that answering that question would be debasing myself,'' shouted Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>. ``It is miserable and absolute slander ... No other country has fought against drugs more systematically than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>.''
Few U.S. representatives were willing to take Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> at his word. But some nonetheless advocated working more closely with him in drug-interdiction efforts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Foreign Relations</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claiborne Pell</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.I</ENAMEX>), after returning from a fact-finding trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> last November, suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> coast guard work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Coast Guard on drug interdiction (even as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> coast guard was providing protection for traffickers). On his return from a December 1988 visit with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Rangel</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>) chastised critics of cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX> on narcotics matters, saying: ``It's not Communists who are killing our kids. It's drugs.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> personnel came under increasing fire from these critics because of their natural reluctance to share sensitive information with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> government. But as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> began providing officials with the most concrete evidence yet of direct Cuban involvement, the time seemed right to test Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>'s sincerity once and for all. So, according to an administration official closely involved in the international drug-interdiction effort, some information provided by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> was shared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> officials.
Separately, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX>, with the knowledge of U.S. drug enforcement officials, sent one of his operatives to Cuba on three separate occasions to get information on other Cuban drug operations as well as arrange plans for the defection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miguel Ruiz Poo</ENAMEX> and Col. de la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guardia</ENAMEX>. The colonel would have been a wonderful ``catch'' for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence. The information he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz Poo</ENAMEX> could have provided on the drug trade and Cuba in general would have been valuable. Unfortunately, we may never know exactly how valuable.
The fate of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX>'s Cuban contacts already had been sealed. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz Poo</ENAMEX> was sentenced to 30 years in prison on July 7 and Col. de la <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guardia</ENAMEX> was executed on July 13.
At a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> is more removed than ever from the civilized world -- even to the point of openly denouncing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s perestroika -- cooperation of any kind simply makes no sense. Indeed, it may well be that the attempt to cooperate with him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruiz</ENAMEX> case led directly to a cover-up in which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> has tried to clear himself at the expense of his underlings. In addition, an opportunity may have been missed to get two of those officials out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> before they could be silenced by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> leader continues assisting drug dealers -- and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Enforcement Agency</ENAMEX> has evidence of Cuban-assisted drug overflights since the drug trials -- providing him with intelligence on drug operations could be dangerous. As former U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Merkel</ENAMEX> says: ``If the Cubans know the parameters of your knowledge, they will better know how to devise schemes to go around your knowledge.''
And back at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami Correctional Center</ENAMEX> it becomes increasingly clear why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reinaldo Ruiz</ENAMEX> fears <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> more than he fears th <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombians</ENAMEX>. ``They say I'm safe here in prison. But you can't play with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidel</ENAMEX> -- like some U.S. senators are trying to do -- without getting burnt.''
