<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, whose recent hostile tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition Equipment Inc.</ENAMEX> failed for lack of financing, apparently has gained a measure of control over the troubled company anyway.
As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed an ``amiable agreement,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect Group</ENAMEX> will wind up with control of top management posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment.
In a management restructuring, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas L. Ringer</ENAMEX> resigned as chairman, chief executive and a director, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Israel Sheinberg</ENAMEX> resigned as a director. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheinberg</ENAMEX> remains as executive vice president. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas M. Hurley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert A. Vanourek</ENAMEX>, who had been designated to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recognition</ENAMEX>'s top spots had Prospect's tender offer succeeded, were named co-chief executives and directors. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hurley</ENAMEX> was formerly a vice president and general manager of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avery International</ENAMEX> division; Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vanourek</ENAMEX> was a former group vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitney Bowes Inc.</ENAMEX>
In addition, the agreement calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert H. Lamphere</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect Group</ENAMEX>'s executive committee, to be named chairman of a restructured board that will include four new independent directors. Also named to the revised board was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas A. Loose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Recognition</ENAMEX>'s senior vice president and general counsel.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based leveraged buy-out firm, also agreed to invest $15 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Recognition</ENAMEX>, which in turn agreed to repurchase as much as $20 million of its stock. That would increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect</ENAMEX>'s ownership of the company's fully-diluted shares outstanding to 20% from 14.1%. Under the agreement, Prospect is permitted to increase its stake in Recognition to 30%. Beyond that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prospect</ENAMEX> said it wouldn't offer to acquire additional shares for less than $11.25 a share during the next year or less than $14.06 a share during the subsequent two years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> also said it obtained a commitment from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Bank and Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> to convert an estimated $18 million in bank debt to a new, 24-month secured term loan to be repaid through the sale of certain assets.
In August, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition</ENAMEX> said it was in violation of certain terms of its debt agreements with bank lenders because of a $3.9 million loss for the third quarter ended July 31. The company attributed the loss to declining revenue and litigation costs relating to criminal charges against the company and two former executives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William G. Moore Jr.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert W. Reedy</ENAMEX>. The former executives were indicted last October on charges of fraud, theft and conspiracy related to efforts by the company to win $400 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Postal Service</ENAMEX> contracts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Recognition Equipment</ENAMEX> said it expected to put the agreement with Prospect to a vote of its stockholders at a special meeting in January.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading, Recognition rose 87.5 cents to $6.625. Prospect slipped 25 cents to $10.50 in national over-the-counter trading.
