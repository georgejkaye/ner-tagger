<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teleport Communications Group</ENAMEX> plans to expand its fiber-optic operations, building networks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.
The closely held company, which has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX> as its main investor, also said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> regulators have designated Teleport a public common carrier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teleport</ENAMEX> currently is negotiating to install a network in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>.
The networks transmit voice, data and video messages across fiber-optic cables that usually are stretched under city streets. At customer locations, multiplexers are installed to convert the electronic impulses from, say, a computer or facsimile machine into light images that can travel on the cables.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teleport</ENAMEX> expects to begin initial service on the three new networks by year end. Each system requires ``several million dollars'' of startup investment and then additional outlays for expansion, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert C. Atkinson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teleport</ENAMEX>'s senior vice president for regulatory and external affairs.
Financial-service and other companies that rely heavily on data transmission ``must have diverse sources of telecommunications services,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atkinson</ENAMEX>. Networks such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Teleport</ENAMEX>'s provide an alternative to those run by, for example, the regional Bell phone companies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teleport</ENAMEX> already has a 180-mile network covering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Queens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Staten Island</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>, plus parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern New Jersey</ENAMEX>. It also operates an eight-mile network in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, which it expects to expand to 12 miles by year-end.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Union Corp.</ENAMEX> has a 3% stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> network and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity Investments</ENAMEX> has 40% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> accounts for the rest of the investment in those two cities and all of the funding for the three new networks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teleport</ENAMEX> has named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Werdell</ENAMEX> vice president and regional general manager for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> units. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werdell</ENAMEX> formerly was general manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Telecommunications.</ENAMEX> The company hasn't yet named a chief for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> network.
