As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Boehm</ENAMEX>, who owns an art porcelain company, sipped her luncheon cocktail, she reeled off the names of a few pals -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Charles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Princess Diana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah Ferguson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kluge</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Petrie</ENAMEX>.
Then, flashing a diamond ring as big as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ritz</ENAMEX> (``my day diamond, darling''), she told her two companions that she is on the ``board'' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vatican Museum</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX>.
As it turns out, the board has a lot of important members, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winton Blount</ENAMEX> (former postmaster general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>), Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Gaisman</ENAMEX> (widow of the inventor of auto-strop razor) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Murphy</ENAMEX> (an investment banker at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch & Co.</ENAMEX>) But Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boehm</ENAMEX> didn't mention any of them.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Boehm</ENAMEX> has a way with names,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Revson</ENAMEX>, a gossip columnist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsday</ENAMEX> (and son of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Revson</ENAMEX>, a founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Revlon</ENAMEX>). Like which are droppable and which are not.
With the fall social season well under way, name-droppers are out in force, trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers. But the truth is that almost everyone, from real-estate agents to city fathers, name-drops; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Katzenjammer Kids</ENAMEX>. (In case you have forgotten, his name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Dirks</ENAMEX>.)
``Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Freudenberger</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> psychoanalyst, with a high-powered clientele. ``It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society.... It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you don't know.''
Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza Minnelli</ENAMEX>. ``I was having a drink in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sardi</ENAMEX>'s, when all of a sudden I saw a woman's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks. I knew it was someone important, so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough, it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza</ENAMEX>. So I said, `<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hello.</ENAMEX>' And she said, `<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hello.</ENAMEX>' Can you imagine? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liza</ENAMEX> said hello to me.''
Some people must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse. ``They can't help talking about the big important people they know, even if they don't really know them,'' says Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freudenberger</ENAMEX>.
Beauregard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houston-Montgomery</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> writer who changed his name from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Stretch</ENAMEX> in 1980, is an inveterate name-dropper. ``I do it innately and pathologically, and while it may occasionally get me into trouble, it's also gotten me access to parties and society,'' he says.
Name-dropping recently helped Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houston-Montgomery</ENAMEX> crash a party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fame magazine</ENAMEX> threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Warhol</ENAMEX>. ``I guess I might have asked Beauregard to leave, but he drops so many good names, we decided to let him stay,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Greenberg</ENAMEX>, publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fame</ENAMEX>. ``After all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warhol</ENAMEX> was the ultimate namedropper, dropping five a day in his diaries. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beauregard</ENAMEX> was mentioned twice -- although very briefly and in passing.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Houston-Montgomery</ENAMEX> says that at the party he waved to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Forbes</ENAMEX>, publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forbes magazine</ENAMEX> (``We've been in the columns together''), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Boone</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> art dealer (``I ``I think she knows me, but I'm not sure ``) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridget Fonda</ENAMEX>, the actress (``She knows me, but we're not really the best of friends'').
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Revson</ENAMEX>, the gossip columnist, says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party. These droppers don't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke Astor</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Georgette Mosbacher</ENAMEX>. ``They even drop semi-obscure names like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Flottl</ENAMEX>, whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Revson</ENAMEX>. ``It's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts.''
But name-dropping has other benefits, often civic. In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image, some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer.
Take <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>. It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuyahoga River</ENAMEX> caught fire, because former Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Perk</ENAMEX> set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock'n' Roll Hall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fame</ENAMEX> was recently refused an urban-development grant. Some people call it ``The Mistake on the Lake'' -- Lake <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Erie</ENAMEX>, that is.
``It helps to point out how many important people came through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> on their way to the top,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Miller</ENAMEX>, executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Cleveland Campaign</ENAMEX>, a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city's strengths.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> notes that actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Newman</ENAMEX>'s family owned a sporting-goods store in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, that the late actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Hamilton</ENAMEX>, who played the bad witch in ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wizard</ENAMEX> Of Oz,'' once ran a nursery school in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> and that comedian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hope</ENAMEX>'s father, a stonemason, once worked on a church next to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Severence Hall</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>'s main concert hall. ``Power names like that don't hurt the city's reputation,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> says.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hollywood</ENAMEX>, an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous. ``Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Van Nuys</ENAMEX> and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lone Ranger</ENAMEX> lived there,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Rambo</ENAMEX>, a sales associate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jon Douglas Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> real-estate agency. ``Most people can't even remember his name.'' (It is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hart</ENAMEX>.)
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambo</ENAMEX> says that a 3.2-acre property overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Fernando Valley</ENAMEX> is priced at $4 million because the late actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erroll Flynn</ENAMEX> once lived there. ``If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flynn</ENAMEX> hadn't lived there, the property might have been priced $1 million lower,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambo</ENAMEX>, noting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flynn</ENAMEX>'s house has been bulldozed, and only the swimming pool remains.
Press agents and public-relations practitioners are notorious name-droppers. And some even do it with malice aforethought. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Len Kessler</ENAMEX>, a financial publicist in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him. He says that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Dorfman</ENAMEX>, a financial columnist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> Today, hasn't returned his phone calls, he leaves messages with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorfman</ENAMEX>'s office saying that he has an important story on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meshulam Riklis</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX>.
He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions. ``But it does get him to return my calls, and it makes me feel better for the times he's given me the brushoff,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kessler</ENAMEX> says.
There are, of course, obvious dangers to blatant, unsubstantiated name-dropping. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffry Thal</ENAMEX>, a publicity agent for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lantz Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud. ``Get caught and you're dead in the water,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thal</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thal</ENAMEX> says that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Taylor</ENAMEX>, a client, ``hates being called `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX>.'... If directors or producers phone me and say they know `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liz</ENAMEX>,' I know they've never met her. She prefers `Elizabeth.'''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> society, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Buckley</ENAMEX>, the very social wife of author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Buckley</ENAMEX>, has the nicknames ``Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buckles</ENAMEX>'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patsy</ENAMEX>.'' And her husband sometimes calls her ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ducky.</ENAMEX>'' ``But call her `<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patty</ENAMEX>,' and it's a sure giveaway you're not in her circle, because she doesn't use that name,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Kron</ENAMEX>, editor-in-chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue magazine</ENAMEX>, a monthly publication sent to all the right names.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Spencer Churchill</ENAMEX>, a nephew of the late Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Churchill</ENAMEX>, former prime minister of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX>, isn't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets. That's because they only drop ``mere names,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX>.
Currently writing his memoirs, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX>, an artist, tells how tycoons such as the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Paul Getty</ENAMEX>, the oil billionnaire, were, in fact, known only by one initial, their last. ``When you're at the club, you ask whether they've spoken to `G.' Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean. But no one else does. Now that's name-dropping, if you know what I mean.
