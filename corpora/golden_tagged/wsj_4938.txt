{First of two articles on the religious right.}
When the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Falwell</ENAMEX> challenged religious conservatives to wake up and change history a decade ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Margaret Norman</ENAMEX> was one who answered his call.
``Back then we were just a bunch of little, separate individuals,'' says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>, whose family cotton farm sits astride the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX> plains outside the town of Post. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>, she says, ``gave us the idea'' that religious conservatives, if united, could wield political power. So she joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral Majority Inc.</ENAMEX>, donating her energy to the tide of right-wing activism that swept through American politics.
But a few years back, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> dropped out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority. Deluged by appeals from conservative causes, she decided instead to help a local Christian school train the next generation of fundamentalists. ``It just seems like the need is greater here,'' she says.
In the past decade, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority has been one of the major forces propelling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> to the right. The shift helped make abortion an evil word to many, school textbooks a censorship matter and racy advertising a reason for boycott. But just now, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>'s footprints appear to be everywhere, he has retired from politics. Last month he quietly dismantled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority. He says its work is done and he is going back to preaching. ``We have raised up a generation of fighters and leaders and activists,'' he says.
In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority was collapsing. The weight of years of strident outbursts and embarrassments caused by zealous members overburdened it. The competition, a raft of right-wing splinter organizations that successfully wooed once-loyal followers like Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>, caught up. Money stopped coming. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority's annual revenue fell to barely $3 million last year from a peak of $11.1 million in 1984, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Demoss</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>'s administrative aide. Active donors dwindled to the point that the mailing list wasn't even paying for itself, according to an activist who has worked closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority. Worse yet, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> was finding himself upstaged by younger leaders with trendier causes, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randall Terry</ENAMEX> with his militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.
Without Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>'s generalship, the religious right has become an army of scattered battalions led by lesser-known but determined leaders, some of whose groups coalesce or split apart depending on the nature of the battle before them. Many religious and political specialists are questioning what that means for the movement's future. ``I think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Right</ENAMEX> is going to remain in tough times. Until they have an administration to organize against, they are just not going to cut it,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Guth</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furman University</ENAMEX> political scientist specializing in the religious right.
Ten years ago, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>'s was the only game in town. Then, the religious right was so disparate and disorganized it didn't even have a name. Its members were so frustrated by the Civil Rights movement, the sexual revolution and other events of the prior two decades that they seemed almost to be waiting for the likes of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>.
He possessed a special blend of qualities that could bring them together. Among the first television preachers, he had built one of the largest Sunday Schools in the nation, put in a decade on the lecture circuit and was heralded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esquire magazine</ENAMEX> as the next Billy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX>.
He drew his followings like an old-fashioned politician, by pressing flesh. As a young preacher in the 1950s, he knocked on 100 doors a day, scouring working-class neighborhoods of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lynchburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, for people overlooked by the other churches. In building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority, as he had built his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas Road Baptist Church</ENAMEX>, he reached out to those on society's fringe, who may have felt estranged from other churches and institutions, and offered them a way back into the mainstream.
In the church, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> preached self-esteem along with Scripture, to let his followers know they were as good as anyone else. He urged them to shuck their leisure suits, stop saying ``ain't'' and overcome fear of financial success. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority, he lectured born-again Christians that they could be powerful if only they put aside their historical distaste for politics.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demoss</ENAMEX> says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> has never troubled himself about social status. But others who have known him believe his crusade to win respect for fundamentalists resulted partly from his attempts to overcome a childhood on the wrong side of the tracks in class-conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lynchburg</ENAMEX>, in a family tainted by drugs, alcohol and violence. His father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carey Falwell</ENAMEX>, was a restaurateur and bootlegger who killed his drug-addled younger brother in a gun battle, then died of cirrhosis of the liver when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> was 15. When a teen-age <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Falwell</ENAMEX> began dating his future wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macel Pate</ENAMEX>, the girl's mother warned that the young man might turn out to be a ``typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>.''
But if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> was trying to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority entirely respectable, he never quite succeeded. Nor was he able to control it. The organization wasn't ever tightly organized. Usually it functioned simply as a mailing list of people who shared similar fears and hostilities toward modern society. But those people, gathered mainly in independent, white Baptist churches in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and other rural areas, followed the lead of their pastors, who followed the lead of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>. His call for a sort of civil-rights revolution for fundamentalists was salve for a decade of pent-up conservative anger.
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> could get his following out for a vote, the group never entirely lost its backwoods image. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> was deeply embarrassed when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority member made headlines nine years ago by picketing a bakery that sold sexually explicit cookies. The organization's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> director embarrassed it too, by saying that Jews have ``almost a supernatural ability to make money.''
Strident activism hardly squared with the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> had wanted to project, that of an increasingly sophisticated group of well-mannered, church-going middle-class citizens. But, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Price</ENAMEX>, a professor of religion at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lynchburg College</ENAMEX>, ``The kind of crowd that was in on it was not the kind of crowd Jerry enjoys being with. He enjoys putting on a tuxedo and going to these Republican functions.''
Sometimes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>'s own comments and actions did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority more harm than good, too.
In 1985, he caused an uproar when he called South African Archbishop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Desmond Tutu</ENAMEX> a ``phony.'' Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority tried to rally evangelicals against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Rights Restoration Act</ENAMEX>, warning the law could force churches to hire ``a practicing, active homosexual drug addict with AIDS to be a teacher or youth pastor.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panicked</ENAMEX> churchgoers jammed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX> phone lines, embarrassing conservative Republicans supporting the bill. Speaking from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> floor, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Simpson</ENAMEX> accused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority of conducting a ``massive misinformation campaign.'' The act reinstated federal protection against discrimination on the basis of sex, race, age or disability that had been curtailed by a 1984 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decision.
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> remained a hit on the lecture circuit and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, he became something of a liability to other conservatives. After he praised a Christian radio program called ``Focus on the Family'' a little too warmly last June, its officials worked to distance themselves from the comments.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority took stands on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>. Man, we don't do that Our organization is concerned with the health of the nuclear family,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Minnery</ENAMEX>, vice president of the Focus on the Family organization in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pasadena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority was losing ground, others were gaining it. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conservatives</ENAMEX> who had dreamed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Falwell</ENAMEX>-like success were starting their own organizations. ``He was like the ice-breaker and we were the little ships who followed him in,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Demar</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Falwell</ENAMEX> admirer who now heads a Christian publisher called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Vision</ENAMEX>.
The result was a flowering of new organizations, which today define the landscape of the religious right. They copied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority's direct-mail tactics, but often took a simpler approach, focusing on single targets: pornography, feminism, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX> or abortion.
Hungry for cash and volunteers, they began recruiting from the same pool of conservative activists that had supplied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lynchburg</ENAMEX>, a city of 70,000, at least three single-issue organizations sprang up. Many organizations offered what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority had not been able to: a clearer focus, better organization and, in causes such as anti-abortion, a plan of action.
Appeals went directly to many of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX>'s top people. ``I got a constant flow of mailings from organizations that wanted me to be involved or to give money,'' says the Rev. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Moore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority's former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> director. He quit three years ago, to supervise his church's move to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>.
He wasn't alone in leaving. Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority got a glimpse of its own weaknesses when it helped sponsor ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Forum</ENAMEX>,'' a rally of right-wing groups in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> intended to remind the Democratic Convention of this particular constituency. Though organizers expected 1,000 participants, barely two dozen registered. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> had to telephone dozens of pastors himself to drum up enough support so the show could go on.
Even then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moral</ENAMEX> Majority was soundly upstaged by a new group, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Rescue</ENAMEX>, which drew all the crowds and publicity by launching sit-in protests at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s abortion clinics.
Meanwhile, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> has a new project: to turn his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lynchburg</ENAMEX> into a fundamentalist institution capable of influencing American culture in a broad way.
He founded the college 18 years ago in a couple of spare rooms at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomas Road Baptist Church</ENAMEX>. It has just enrolled 8,000 students in fall classes. Its president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Pierre Guillermin</ENAMEX>, is a graduate of fundamentalist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob Jones University</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Jones</ENAMEX>, Liberty enforces a strict code of student conduct. Men wear shirts and ties to class. Alcohol is forbidden and its use is ground for exclusion. Other no-nos are ``witchcraft, seances, {and} Ouija boards.''
By the next century, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Falwell</ENAMEX> is predicting, students and faculty of Liberty ``will have the kind of impact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> has had on this country.
