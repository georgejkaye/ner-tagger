The over-the-counter market sprang to life, posting its strongest gains in over a month.
Traders said Wednesday's resiliency in equity markets helped boost prices yesterday. They added that end-of-the-quarter buying has helped many issues' prices climb.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite Index jumped 3.37 to 471.14, or 0.72%, its biggest one-day advance since gaining over four points in late August. By comparison, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> Composite rose 0.9%.
``The market's telling you it isn't ready to go down,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.E. Geduld</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herzog Heine Geduld</ENAMEX>.
Along with other traders, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geduld</ENAMEX> expressed surprise that stock prices withstood Wednesday's gloomy earnings outlook by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>, which also influences OTC technology stocks.
``When they don't go down on bad news, you know they're going up,'' he said.
Trading volume climbed to 133.1 million shares from 123.2 million on Wednesday. Stocks that gained in price led decliners, 1,057 to 838.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Costanza</ENAMEX>, head of the OTC trading department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Barney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harris Upham</ENAMEX>, said low inventory among dealers and a reluctance by many institutions to sell at the end of a strong third quarter have shrunk the supply of stocks available to buyers. That sets the stage for higher prices when investors decide to buy, he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Costanza</ENAMEX> said this lack of supply, coupled with a resilient market and high cash levels among retail investors, could mean further gains in the fourth quarter.
Waste-management stocks provided investors with a focus in both the OTC market and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>. Analysts say buyers have been attracted by the relative values in the group, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Professional Investor Report. Some analysts said much of the buying was fueled by a move by investors out of technology stocks, which have been plagued by earnings disappointments. Among those issues benefiting from the trend was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laidlaw Transportation</ENAMEX>, the OTC market's largest transportation stock. The Class B shares of the waste transporter rose 7/8 to 19 1/2, a new 52-week high. The stock was on the most active list, with volume exceeding 2.5 million shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laidlaw</ENAMEX>'s Class A shares also gained 7/8 to 19 3/4.
The boost in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Laidlaw</ENAMEX> pushed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Transportation</ENAMEX> index up 9.62 to 480.50, making it the strongest of the Nasdaq indexes.
Other waste-management stocks that gained in OTC trading included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allwaste</ENAMEX>, which surged 2 1/8 to 23 1/4, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brand Cos.</ENAMEX>, which added 1/4 to 28 1/4.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Utility Index</ENAMEX> gained 7.41 to 746.55. The index includes cellular telephone issues, as well as other telecommunication stocks.
Among those gaining, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN Broadcasting</ENAMEX> rose 1 3/4 to 109 3/4. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaw Cellular Communications</ENAMEX> has been rumored to be preparing a sweetened offer for the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccaw</ENAMEX> added 1/2 to 36.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Telecommunications</ENAMEX>, whose shares have languished since the company stiffened its anti-takeover defenses earlier this month, rose 1 to 63 1/2.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications</ENAMEX>, the largest Nasdaq stock, gained 3/4 to 45 1/4. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody</ENAMEX>'s upgraded the company's subordinated notes and debentures, citing the company's improving cash flow and profitability.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guber-Peters Entertainment</ENAMEX> was the most active OTC issue, rising 3 7/8 to 17 on volume of more than 2.8 million shares. The company accepted a $17.50-a-share cash acquisition proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony USA</ENAMEX>. The proposal was linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>'s offer to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Intertech</ENAMEX> jumped 6 1/2 to 25 1/2 following Wednesday's $27.50-a-share acquisition offer for the company from the investment firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas & Partners</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrington Laboratories</ENAMEX> fell 2 1/2 to 21. The stock has been hurt by speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Casualty</ENAMEX> might sell its 10% stake in the drug maker because the portfolio manager who took the position has died, the Professional Investor Report said. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Casualty</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrington Labs</ENAMEX> officials could be reached for comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> lost 1 1/2 to 8. Analysts said investors are concerned about the company's financial outlook.
