The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Brotherhood of Carpenters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joiners</ENAMEX> said it expects to lose nearly half of the $95 million it invested in six real-estate deals and is suing its financial advisers for negligence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> officials said the loss won't affect its member services or its general stability because the money came from a $200 million investment fund that was part of its general treasury, but doesn't include pension assets.
Union President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sigurd Lucassen</ENAMEX> said the union made six commercial real-estate loans in 1985 and 1986 at the recommendation of its advisers, including a waterfront complex in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, condominiums in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nyack</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, and projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>. Only the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> loan didn't go into default.
``We're taking every step necessary to stabilize the situation,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucassen</ENAMEX> said earlier this week. He said although the loans, authorized by his predecessor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick Campbell</ENAMEX>, were made in good faith, he doesn't believe the union should make direct real-estate loans.
The carpenters union is suing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empire Contract Consulting</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and its two principals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Adler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Burns</ENAMEX>, for failing to properly analyze the investments and advise the union on the loans' performance. The suit, filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superior Court</ENAMEX> for the District of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, seeks compensation for the union's losses and court costs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> officials said they'll revise their financial reports to reflect an expected loss of $45 million on the real-estate deals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Empire</ENAMEX>'s attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Sporkin</ENAMEX>, told the Associated Press that his clients deny the allegations and that the company was being drawn into an internal dispute between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucassen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucassen</ENAMEX> said that although the loans began having problems in 1987, the union continued to receive positive reports from Empire. Earlier this year, the union learned the loans were having problems and hired outside experts to examine them.
