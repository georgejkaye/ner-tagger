(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMOKING</ENAMEX> HAD BEEN A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WORLDLY PLEASURE</ENAMEX> since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Columbus</ENAMEX> got the habit from Indians in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New World</ENAMEX>. But then came the Jan. 11, 1964, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government report linking tobacco to cancer.
There had been earlier suspicions and warnings, such as Englishman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hill</ENAMEX>'s ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cautions</ENAMEX> Against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immoderate Use</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Snuff</ENAMEX>'' which dealt with snuff sniffers' nose tumors. But the lankmark assault was issued on a Saturday morning (so the stock market wouldn't be upset) by U.S. Surgeon General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luther L. Terry</ENAMEX>. It said that ``cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> to warrent appropriate remedial action.'' It cited many fugures including male smokers having 68% higher death rate than nonsmokers.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tobacco Institute</ENAMEX>, founded in 1958 and funded by tobacco companies, challenged that report and earlier ones such as the 1957 study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Cancer Society</ENAMEX> that linked smoking to lung cancer and heart disease. And the institute still asserts that there isn't scientific proof that smoking is the villain.
In 1966 an act of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> required the first cigarette package health warning (``Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Your Health</ENAMEX>''), but ads didn't have to bear the warning. On April 1, 1970, TV and radio cigarette ads were banned. And effective March 30, 1972, all cigarette ads had to carry a health warning.
Only about 29% of the nation's adults are still puffing, down from 40% in 1965. Nevertheless, 575 billion cigarettes were burned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> in 1988, down from a record 640 billion in 1981 but still far above the 397 billion in 1951 when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pall Mall</ENAMEX>'s radio spiel was a hoarse: ``Guard against throat scratch, guard against throat scratch.
