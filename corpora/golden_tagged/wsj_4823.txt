<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Former Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce</ENAMEX> was denied a requested delay in his scheduled testimony today before the House subcommittee investigating the unfolding federal housing scandal.
Yesterday, in a letter to the chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Government Operations</ENAMEX> subcommittee on employment and housing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Perito</ENAMEX> and two other lawyers for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> sought the delay, saying they haven't had adequate time to prepare Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> to testify because they were retained Sept. 6.
After the request was denied, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perito</ENAMEX> said his client will obey a subpoena and appear before the panel today. But the lawyer wouldn't say if the former secretary would answer questions or invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> didn't appear voluntarily as scheduled for a Sept. 15 hearing.
Last week, the subcommittee subpoenaed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> to appear today and on Oct. 27 and Nov. 3. His lawyers had asked that today's hearing be canceled and that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> appear Oct. 27 as planned. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> testified in May.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lantos</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the subcommittee, said the panel's work wouldn't be delayed because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> ``procrastinated'' in obtaining counsel.
