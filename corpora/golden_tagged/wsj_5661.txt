<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co op AG</ENAMEX> said it will emerge from receivership under West German bankruptcy laws after a last-minute rescue agreement with creditor banks.
Under the accord, creditor banks of the troubled West German retailer agreed to a proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Genossenschafts Bank</ENAMEX>, under which the banks will forgive 75% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co op</ENAMEX>'s debt of 2.7 billion marks ($1.37 billion) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DG Bank</ENAMEX> will take over all shares in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> concern, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co op</ENAMEX>'s chief spokesman.
``Debt forgiveness was declared, the full concept was accepted, so the state of overindebtedness no longer exists,'' the spokesman said.
But not all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co op</ENAMEX>'s creditors agreed to the rescue plan. ``We have sufficient support, but it is not 100%,'' a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DG Bank</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers and company</ENAMEX> officials will try to win the support of banks that rejected the plan, he said.
The bailout plan also calls for a reduction in the nominal value of the shares, followed by a sale of shares to raise funds.
