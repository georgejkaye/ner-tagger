<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Bell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, is to announce today that it signed an agreement that will let it market an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</ENAMEX> network management system.
Systems such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T Accumaster Integrator</ENAMEX> are needed by corporate customers whose computer and telecommunications networks are becoming so large and complex that they need a system to tie all the pieces together.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Caccappolo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> vice president, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> has developed its own software to manage the various parts of computer and telecommunications networks but needed an integrator that the computer concern could provide to its customers. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys</ENAMEX> decided against developing one on its own because there will be room for very few of these systems in the marketplace. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> already have staked out the territory.
