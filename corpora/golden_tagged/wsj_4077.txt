<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittle Communications L.P.</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Samuels</ENAMEX>, 43 years old, a producer on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> television network's ``Today'' morning news program, executive producer of its ``Channel One'' news program for schools.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuels</ENAMEX>'s role will be a pivotal one in developing the tone and substance of the daily 12-minute program, which is due to be launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> in at least 1,000 schools next March. The show was viewed in a $5 million, five-week test last spring at six schools. The test shows were produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Winston</ENAMEX>, a former producer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> television network's ``Good Morning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>,'' with help from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Rukeyser</ENAMEX>, editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittle Communications</ENAMEX>.
``Channel One'' will be closely watched by educational groups, some of which have sharply criticized the two minutes of advertising the show carries. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Whittle</ENAMEX>, chairman and founder of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Knoxville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, company, said the advertising will pay for the installation of satellite dishes, video recorders and TV monitors in the schools.
In a related development, a group of major cable programmers and cable system operators said it will form Cable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance for Education</ENAMEX> to examine the need for and use of cable programming in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> schools. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittle Communications</ENAMEX> is not part of the group.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> said its programmers, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Discovery Channel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Family Channel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX>, will provide schools with commercial-free programming such as news shows and dramatic presentations.
In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amos B. Hostetter Jr.</ENAMEX>, Alliance chairman, said system operators will ``ensure that every senior and junior high school passed by cable will be provided a standard cable {connection} and free basic {cable} service within three years... as a working demonstration of the cable industry's commitment to education.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hostetter</ENAMEX> is chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Cablevision Inc.</ENAMEX> The alliance is expected to be based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hostetter</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX> is also trying to reach principals and teachers who will be most directly involved with its program on a daily basis. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rukeyser</ENAMEX> said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuels</ENAMEX> will help develop teachers' guides and work closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittle</ENAMEX>'s advisory board on the network.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuels</ENAMEX>, a nine-year ``Today'' veteran, is the author of ``It's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Country : A Young Person</ENAMEX>'s Guide to Politics and Elections,'' published last year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Athenaeum</ENAMEX>. She was also a senior producer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Main Street</ENAMEX>,'' a monthly news hour for teen-agers, which has since been canceled.
``I don't see making any changes in the format {of'Channel One'}; it's brilliant,'' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuels</ENAMEX>. ``We will, however, make modifications along the way.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Winter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittle</ENAMEX> division president in charge of ``Channel One,'' which will be produced initially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, said the choice of an executive producer is important in light of protests against ``Channel One'' and similar shows being planned on cable networks.
``There is a perception that just anyone can do TV news for teen-agers,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winter</ENAMEX>. ``We want a great-quality show that is second to none.
