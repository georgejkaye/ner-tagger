Others named in the suit include Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groben</ENAMEX>'s wife and two sons and ten vendors that allegedly made payments to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groben</ENAMEX> in exchange for continuing their contracts with the the company and for purchasing goods at excessive prices.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farberware</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based kitchenware manufacturer, is a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanson Industries</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanson</ENAMEX>
According to the complaint, tapes of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cameron</ENAMEX>'s telephone calls were mailed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farberware</ENAMEX> executives, employees, and competitors in January 1989. After an investigation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farberware</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groben</ENAMEX> was dismissed, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John S. Martin Jr.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schulte Roth & Zabel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farberware</ENAMEX>'s lawyer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> wouldn't disclose the subject of the conversations or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Groben</ENAMEX>'s alleged motives for making the tapes.
The defendants have been charged under the controversial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racketeer Influenced</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corrupt Organizations</ENAMEX> Act, under which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farberware</ENAMEX> is entitled to seek three times the amount of damages it sustained.
