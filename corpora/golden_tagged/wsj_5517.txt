Two days of talks on steel issues ended inconclusively Tuesday, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> unable to agree on what <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s share should be under a revamped quota agreement, Japanese government sources said.
This session, the third round of discussions, focused on a renewal of the voluntary restraint agreement covering Japanese steel exports to the U.S.
Sources said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and Japanese officials have agreed to meet in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> late next week for a fourth round of discussions, prior to the existing agreement's Sept. 30 expiration date.
Under the expiring format, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> has a 5.8% share of the 18.4% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> steel market set aside  for foreign companies.
The meetings follow President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s July declaration that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> is willing to negotiate a 30-month extension of its general voluntary restraint agreement on steel with trading partners.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sources</ENAMEX> disclosed earlier this week that participants are encountering difficulties in nailing down a new quota share for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> against the backdrop of U.S. pressure for ``structural'' reforms in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s steel industry.
