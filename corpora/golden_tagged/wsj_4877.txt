<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maynard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, said it has developed a new chip-packaging technology that can double computer performance when compared with conventional circuit board packaging technology.
The technology -- which allows up to 30 times greater circuit density than conventional boards -- was developed at more than $100 million. The densely packed circuits operate more efficiently, yet don't need additional cooling, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> said.
``This will change the way we design computers, letting us do things we couldn't do before, with better performance at lower cost,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Glorioso</ENAMEX>, vice president, high performance systems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAX</ENAMEX> 9000 mainframe computers, expected next month, will be the first models to use the new technology, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> has lagged in the design of mainframe-class computers behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>, which has dominated the lucrative market. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> is making progress, analysts say.
