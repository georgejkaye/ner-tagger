When investors think of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX>, they think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> insurer's $6 billion junk-bond portfolio.
Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Carr</ENAMEX> wants to change that. He now is on the road, telling investors he has built a great insurance company and isn't a river boat gambler. Some say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> is right. But as he winds up his tour to promote a $255 million First Executive rights offering, it's clear he has an uphill struggle to win over Wall Street investors.
Junk bonds were the making of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive.</ENAMEX> High investment income allowed the company to grow by offering attractive returns to policyholders. But with the junk market getting clobbered recently, some say junk bonds might be the undoing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive.</ENAMEX>
Since the rights offering was announced in June, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> stock has dived to 10 7/8 yesterday from 16 1/4, largely on junk-bond scares but also on deflating takeover rumors about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive.</ENAMEX> Since being issued last week, the rights have quickly tumbled. So have prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> common-stock warrants and preferred, trading on a ``when issued'' basis.
The rights offering entitles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> stockholders to buy a $15 package of convertible preferred shares and warrants. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX>'s stock got clobbered, underwriters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> had to cut the exercise price on First Executive commonstock warrants to 15 from 20. That's the price warrant holders would pay to buy a share.
What is the junk-bond scare all about? In recent months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> has written down to zero about $150 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Resources</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southmark</ENAMEX> securities. It also has taken big hits on other holdings, including almost $100 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Griffin Resorts</ENAMEX> bonds, $160 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gillett Holding</ENAMEX> bonds and smaller amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores</ENAMEX> bonds. Its $17 billion investment portfolio now is about $400 million ``under water,'' meaning that the market value is way below the cost and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> would look bad if, like a mutual fund, it had to mark the bonds down.
If the market sell-off of junk resumes, some say investment losses might force the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> insurer to keep adding capital, or to slow the growth of its profitable insurance operations. With the junk market getting more illiquid, there's also a worry that if policyholders start to redeem <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> insurance policies, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> might have to dump junk bonds at big discounts, adding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX>'s losses.
Money manager <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin Sosnoff of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> thinks Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> is ``a great businessman.'' But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sosnoff</ENAMEX> sold a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> stake a couple of months ago at about 16. His concern: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> has more than half of its $17 billion investment portfolio in junk bonds and other bonds that are below investment grade, a much higher proportion than other insurers. And ``we were concerned about the valuation of the portfolio.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> declined to comment until the rights offering officially ends Oct. 10. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> will get its money next month from the rights offering, no matter what. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> shareholders don't cough up $255 million and buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> preferred and warrants, underwriters <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> might be saddled with losses on the preferred, quoted yesterday at 14 5/8. People in the underwriting group say that's a real possibility.
Nobody knows if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosewood Financial Partners</ENAMEX>, a long-rumored acquirer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX>, will exercise its rights to maintain its current 9% stake. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rosewood</ENAMEX> didn't return calls. But this week, insurer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.C.H. Corp.</ENAMEX>, which had a 20% First Executive stake, declined to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> preferred. It simply swapped First Executive rights it received for warrants in a noncash transaction valued at about $5 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> won't comment. But traders say the firm marked down and sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> preferred that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.C.H.</ENAMEX> passed up. They say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> expects 60% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> holders to exercise their rights, and hopes new investors will buy the remaining 20% of the preferred shares.
The rights offering has attracted a shareholder lawsuit and criticism from people who see it as an anti-takeover device. It also is a costly way to raise capital, fueling talk that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> might fear a cash squeeze. Companies usually issue equity when their stock price is high. Moreover, the new preferred will pay a $2 annual dividend rate, perhaps in additional preferred, putting the yield currently at a generous 13.8%.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> carries a Triple-A rating on its ability to pay claims. If it had issued debt instead of equity, its rating might have suffered, analysts say.
Is the junk-bond scare over First Executive really justified? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Posner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity Investments</ENAMEX>, a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> stockholder, says, ``It's frustrating that the stock is always moved by rumors and scares. It's a sound company and in the long run, its fundamental strength should be reflected in the stock.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Posner</ENAMEX> won't say if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fidelity</ENAMEX> will buy more First Executive shares, however.
Bulls say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX>, a veteran junk-bond player and privileged investment client of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, has a better-than-average junk portfolio. To meet possible insurance-policy redemptions, adds a senior insurance executive familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX>, the company has about $5 billion of liquid short-term securities. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> has $329 million of bonds that have stopped paying interest, this person adds, in 1989 it will have $2 billion of cash investment income to cover about $1.4 billion of interest obligations to policyholders and related expenses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> has ``had a horrible six months and has written off'' a lot of junk, the insurance executive says, but it still showed six-month profit of about $100 million, excluding special items.
Offsetting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX>'s bond losses are many equity investments that it could sell at a profit, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Schoder</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conning & Co.</ENAMEX>
As a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> client, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> often got equity ``kickers'' for buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> bond deals. On more recent investments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Executive</ENAMEX> has about a $40 million profit on its equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> and a $25 million profit on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magnatek</ENAMEX> stake. Some say it also has an estimated $150 million profit on its buildings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
