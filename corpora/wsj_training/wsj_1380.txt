The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks. The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage, in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits. It's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market.
