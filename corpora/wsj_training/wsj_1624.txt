Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt.
But while the overall market improved, the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties, even as junk-bond prices rose.
Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> said it postponed a $220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York International Corp.</ENAMEX>
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</ENAMEX> scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $475 million debenture offering by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp.</ENAMEX> that was still being negotiated late last night.
The issue by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar. Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk.
Since last week's junk-bond market debacle, many new issues of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back, delayed or dropped. On Wednesday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> had to slash the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX>' junk-bond offering to $71 million from $150 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> has delayed Grand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Co.</ENAMEX>'s $1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction. Last week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Union</ENAMEX> offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">York</ENAMEX> issue was delayed because of market conditions.
``Everything is going through firehoops right now, and {<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Western</ENAMEX>} is no exception,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariel Clemensen</ENAMEX>, vice president, high-yield research, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>.
Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Baldwin</ENAMEX>, managing director of high-yield investments at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chancellor Capital Management</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> & North Western offering was restructured in part because ``several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package. If you're going to take the risk in this market, you want something extra.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baldwin</ENAMEX> likes the offering. But several mutual-fund managers, nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues, said they're staying away from any junk security that isn't considered first rate for its class. While they consider the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> & <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Western</ENAMEX> issue to be good, they don't view it as the best.
To lure buyers to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago & North Western</ENAMEX> bonds, portfolio managers said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10% equity kicker. The bonds are expected to have a 14 1/2% coupon rate. The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10% of the stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNW Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago & North Western's</ENAMEX> parent company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the restructuring.
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations, the 10% of equity would come directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> and a fund affiliated with the investment bank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone Group</ENAMEX>, which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5% each. That would leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blackstone</ENAMEX> fund with a 60% stake and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin</ENAMEX> with 15%.
Despite the problems with new issues, high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary, or resell, market. Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Capital Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> rising one point.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> market, the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point, or $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount. The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows. That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Department</ENAMEX> reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2% last month, slightly lower than some economists had expected.
But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasurys</ENAMEX>.
Short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities ended narrowly mixed, with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher.
Yesterday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> executed four-day matched sales, a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system. The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> doesn't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3/4% at which it has been hovering around during the past week. The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans. It is considered an early signal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> credit policy changes.
``The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively. They are telling us that {8 3/4%} is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Chandross</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lloyds Bank PLC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25/32 to yield 7.955%, compared with 100 29/32 to yield 8.032% Wednesday. The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9/32 to yield 7.937%, compared with 99 26/32 to yield 8.007%.
Short-term rates rose yesterday. The discount rate on three-month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills rose to 7.56% from 7.51% Wednesday, while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57% from 7.53%.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> sold $9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday. The average yield on the bills was 7.35%, down from 7.61% at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21. Yesterday's yield was the lowest since 7.22% on July 27.
Here are details of the auction:
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.
Corporate Issues
Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities.
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1/4 to 1/2 point with so-called quality issues from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Capital Holdings Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership</ENAMEX> posting one-point gains.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petrolane Gas Service</ENAMEX>'s 13 1/4% debentures traded at 102, after trading around par earlier this week, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR</ENAMEX>'s 13 1/2% subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5/8 after trading at below par earlier this week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX>-grade bonds were unchanged. Municipals
Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market, as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector.
Traders estimated that more than $140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers. There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank's portfolios.
According to market participants, the bonds were met with decent bids, but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield.
Away from the general obligation sector, activity was modest. Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3/8 point.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Jersey Turnpike Authority</ENAMEX>'s 7.20% issue of 2018 was up 3/8 at 98 3/8 bid to yield about 7.32%, down 0.03 percentage point.
The debt of some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday's massive earthquake, although traders said market participants remained cautious.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California</ENAMEX> expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $500 million to $1 billion in damages resulting from the quake, according to a state official.
It's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cindy Katz</ENAMEX>, assistant director of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>'s department of finance, although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose isn't anticipated.
Meanwhile, new issuance was slow.
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia Public School Authority</ENAMEX>. A balance of $25.8 million remained in late order-taking, according to the lead manager.
Mortgage-Backed Securities
Mortgage securities generally ended 6/32 to 9/32 point higher, but lagged gains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Premium Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> securities with coupon rates of 13% and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> 13% securities were down about 1/4 at 109 30/32.
If the refinancing plan clears <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities, hurting any investor paying much above par for them.
In the current-coupon sector, a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> 9% securities ended at 98 6/32, up 9/32, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> 9% securities were at 97 10/32, up 6/32. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ginnie Mae</ENAMEX> 9% issue was yielding 9.42% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48.
While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve, underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable.
Two new Remics totaling $900 million were announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> yesterday.
Foreign Bonds
British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 was down 2/32 at 111 29/32 to yield 10.09%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19/32 to yield 12.94%.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, the bellwether No. 111 4.6% bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72, to yield 5.32%, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, the 7% benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02%.
