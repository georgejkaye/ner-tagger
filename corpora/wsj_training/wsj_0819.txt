There are two versions of ``Measure for Measure'' on stage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alley Theater</ENAMEX> here. One is a strong, vigorous portrayal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s play; the other is director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Boyd</ENAMEX>'s overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX>.
``Measure for Measure'' is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s ``problem'' plays, so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy, comedy or history. Its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now.
Last season, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartford</ENAMEX> Stage director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Lamos</ENAMEX> mounted a production at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln Center</ENAMEX>, and currently two other productions -- one just closed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Globe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> and another now at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> Rep -- overlap with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX>'s.
In the play, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX>, hoping he can set things right. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> hears that the young man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio</ENAMEX> has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> summarily condemns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio</ENAMEX> to death.
When, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio</ENAMEX>'s sister, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX>, a novitiate in a convent, goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> to plead her brother's case, the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and, in a supreme act of hypocrisy, demands that Isabella yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother's life.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX>, who set the original scheme in motion, appears on the scene disguised as a friar and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the Duke arranges a last minute reprieve for all concerned.
For the Alley production, scene designer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter David Gould</ENAMEX> has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience. When the action requires, a prison cell, consisting of an enlarged wire cage, rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform.
In the play's major scenes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the Shakespearean dynamic. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Lauren</ENAMEX>) confronts her brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Loney</ENAMEX>) in his cell, explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom; when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> and the disguised Duke (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Kerr</ENAMEX>) conspire to trick <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX>; and when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mariana (Annalee Jefferies</ENAMEX>), a woman wronged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX>, confronts him with his past misdeeds, the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence.
At such moments Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior interpreter of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>.
When, however, he decides to be modern, or more accurately, when he decides to be trendy, the results are far less satisfactory. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make Shakespeare accessible to today's audiences. It's a valid approach, but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste.
In his ``Measure,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> has ``modernized'' the pimps and prostitutes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angelo</ENAMEX> is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites, punk rockers and heavy metal types, with a strong emphasis on leather, chains and porno-inspired costumes. Loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes, even those in the convent.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claudio</ENAMEX> is arrested, he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles. When the opportunist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucio</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Stehlin</ENAMEX>) visits the convent to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabella</ENAMEX> of her brother's fate, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lucio</ENAMEX> not only slaps the mother superior on her rear, but brings along a voluptuous companion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jill Powell</ENAMEX>), not in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s script, to undulate lasciviously.
Meanwhile, the pimp <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pompey</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glen Allen Pruett</ENAMEX>), dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece, indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts to launch a space probe.
The problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination. The inclusion at one point, for example, of a list of glitzy modern-day malefactors, ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Bakker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leona Helmsley</ENAMEX> to Zsa <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsa Gabor</ENAMEX>, is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX>'s ability.
Despite the excesses, however, the scorecard for the production has many more pluses than minuses. What's more, it represents an important step for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alley Theater</ENAMEX>. ``Measure for Measure'' is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX>'s first directorial assignment as the theater's new artistic director.
He succeeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Brown</ENAMEX>, who was fired by the Alley board 18 months ago. Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Zeisler</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theatre Communications Group</ENAMEX>, to write an editorial in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Theatre magazine</ENAMEX> condemning the board. None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative.
Now the Alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts. Not only is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage, the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in 10 years. As opposed to the $1.4 million deficit of the 1987-88 season, the 1988-89 year concluded with a $200,000 surplus and a $500,000 cash reserve.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Admittedly</ENAMEX> last season's runaway hit, ``Steel Magnolias,'' helped a lot, but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board. Only time will tell if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Vance</ENAMEX>, was at the height of her powers. But it is clear he is going to give it a shot.
