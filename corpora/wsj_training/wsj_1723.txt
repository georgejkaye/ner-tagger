<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks closed higher in moderately active but directionless trading as the recent anxiety in world stock markets continued to fade.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> shares also closed firmer in thin trading driven largely by technical factors and support from a new Wall Street rally. Prices also rose on almost every other major exchange in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index of 225 issues, which gained 111.48 points Wednesday, climbed 266.66, or 0.76%, to 35374.22. Volume on the first section was estimated at 800 million shares, compared with 841 million Wednesday. Winners outnumbered losers 645-293, with 186 issues unchanged.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Friday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> index rose 170.65 points, to 35544.87.
On Thursday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 0.24 point Wednesday, was up 22.78, or 0.86%, at 2665.66.
The morning session was dominated by individuals and dealers, but some institutions participated in the afternoon, encouraged by the market's firmness, traders said. Sentiment was helped by the small gain made by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> stocks Wednesday despite anxiety over possible effects of the major earthquake that struck <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern California</ENAMEX> Tuesday.
Having survived both last Friday's 6.9% Wall Street plunge and the immediate aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area earthquake, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market participants expressed relief that trading had returned to normal.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiroyuki Murai</ENAMEX>, general manager of the stock trading division at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Securities</ENAMEX>, said that after looking at the reasons for Friday's Wall Street plunge, participants realized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> markets have different economic fundamentals. This conclusion, he said, restored the credibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshiaki Mitsuoka</ENAMEX>, head of the investment information department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa Investment Trust & Management</ENAMEX>, said that if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> stocks just fluctuate in or near their current range, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market will remain firm with a moderately upward trend for the rest of the year.
But traders said the market lacks a base on which to set long-term buying strategy, as the future direction of U.S. interest rates remains unclear.
``Investor interest switches back and forth ceaselessly as they are unable to shift their weight to one side for sure,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsuoka</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa Investment Trust</ENAMEX> said.
Many of Wednesday's winners were losers yesterday as investors quickly took profits and rotated their buying to other issues, traders said.
Pharmaceuticals made across-the-board advances. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujisawa Pharmaceutical</ENAMEX> gained 130 to 1,930 yen ($13.64) a share, Mochida Pharmaceutical was up 150 at 4,170, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eisai</ENAMEX> advanced 60 to 2,360.
Housing issues were boosted by a report that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa House</ENAMEX> expects to post 43% higher earnings for its latest fiscal year, traders said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiwa House</ENAMEX> advanced 100 to 2,610, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Misawa Homes</ENAMEX> was up 60 at 2,940, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sekisui House</ENAMEX> gained 100 to 2,490.
Leading construction companies also attracted interest for their strong earnings outlooks, traders said. They and many other major Japanese corporations will issue results soon for the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohbayashi</ENAMEX> was up 60 to close at 1,680, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shimizu</ENAMEX> gained 50 to 2,120, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kumagai-Gumi</ENAMEX> advanced 40 to 1,490.

Dealers said the market was underpinned by a squeeze in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>-SE 100 stocks, particularly among market-makers seeking shares that had been hit hard in recent weeks, such as retailers and building-related concerns.
But despite the flurry of interest in those shares, dealers said, the market remains nervous about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>'s volatility and high U.K. interest rates.
U.K. money supply figures for September, released yesterday, showed continued growth in corporate and personal lending, which will keep pressure on the government to maintain tight credit.
Among the stocks featured in the market-makers' squeeze was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, which closed at 107 pence ($1.70) a share, up 3.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Universal Stores</ENAMEX>, another top-tier stock hit recently by concerns over retail demand in the face of high interest rates, gained 20 to # 10.44. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Storehouse</ENAMEX> gained 2 to
Another active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FT</ENAMEX>-SE 100 stock was clothing and furniture retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burton</ENAMEX>, which gained 6 to 196.
Insurers recovered ground again on market-maker demand and speculative buying linked to talk of mergers in the industry before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX>'s planned market unification in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Insurance</ENAMEX> was the sector's hottest issue, ending 15 higher at 465. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Alliance</ENAMEX> fell 1 to close at 289, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accident</ENAMEX> jumped 10 to # 10.13.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T Industries</ENAMEX> surged in afternoon dealings after its shareholders approved a plan to dispose of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> retailing operations to fend off <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoylake Investment</ENAMEX>'s # 13.4 billion ($21.33 billion) hostile bid. With the company also exercising a plan to buy back as many as 10% of its shares outstanding, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> closed at 783, up 27. Turnover was 6.8 million shares, including about four million shares traded in the afternoon after the shareholders' meeting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.A.T</ENAMEX> said it purchased 2.5 million shares at 785.
