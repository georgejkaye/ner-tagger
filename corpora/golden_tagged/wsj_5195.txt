About a year ago, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s hottest new television companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS Entertainment PLC</ENAMEX>, tried to become a hit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> by buying a hot U.S. production company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX> Yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> admitted its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> debut flopped.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> stunned industry analysts here by announcing it expects MTM to post an operating loss this year. It said it is considering job cuts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX>, is trimming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX>'s production finance, and is hiring a new U.S. sales manager. It blamed the problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> -- famous for such past hits as the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Tyler Moore</ENAMEX> Show,'' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Street Blues</ENAMEX>'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Elsewhere</ENAMEX>'' -- on difficulties in peddling reruns of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> shows to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> broadcasters.
The news caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX>'s stock price to tumble 26.4%, or by 69 pence ($1.09) a share, to 192 pence apiece. Recent reports of mounting problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> had provided some warning, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> financial analysts said the announcement was worse than they had expected. Some speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX>'s U.S. problem might make it vulnerable to a takeover next year, when British restrictions on ownership of broadcast companies are expected to ease.
The expected loss at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> is an ignominious development for what was once one of the U.S. TV industry's most-admired producers. Named after a co-founder, actress <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Tyler Moore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> won industry awards and investors' praise for a string of hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But since 1982, when its popular ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newhart</ENAMEX>'', ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remington Steele</ENAMEX>,'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Elsewhere</ENAMEX>'' shows began airing, it hasn't had a new network hit. Worse, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> said yesterday, a ``weakness'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market for syndicating reruns is hurting what would otherwise be its cash cow: getting extra cash by peddling its old hits.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Times</ENAMEX> are, indeed, tough in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> for many reruns. The market for ``off-network syndication'' -- industry jargon for reruns sold to local U.S. broadcasters -- has been ``weak for the last three or four seasons,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell Praver</ENAMEX>, vice president and director of programming at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based consulting firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> Continental Television. The allure of many reruns, especially of hour-long shows, has recently diminished for broadcasters struggling to hook increasingly jaded viewers. Hot new talk-format shows such as the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oprah Winfrey</ENAMEX> Show'' are also crowding out time slots previously reserved for reruns.
``Our problem is a weak market,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> spokesman said. ``It isn't a company problem.''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> also is unfortunate enough to be selling some of the wrong kinds of reruns. One MTM specialty, hour-long drama shows such as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill Street Blues</ENAMEX>'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Elsewhere</ENAMEX>,'' is death for rerun ratings. Preferred afternoon viewing is light, half-hour comedies and game-shows, analysts say. The hour shows have n't as much ``long-term value'' when trying to syndicate them.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> officials, expressing confidence they can turn MTM around, say they plan to ride out the market weakness and redouble their sales efforts. It said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> has 13 new TV shows in the works, at least some of which it is counting on for a hit. It said it is ``confident'' its cost-cutting measures at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> ``should in due course eliminate the effect of these losses on the (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TVS</ENAMEX>) group.''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to quantify the expected MTM loss, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> analysts speculated it would total at least # 10 million. That amount is enough to wipe out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX>'s expected pretax profit from ordinary activities in the 1989 second-half from its prosperous British operations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment, but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> statement yesterday said that because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX>'s problems, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX>'s total 1989 pretax profit from ordinary activities won't exceed last year's # 26.1 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX>'s $320 million purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTM</ENAMEX> last year was the boldest expansion move so far attempted by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s once-stodgy television industry.
Of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s 15 privately owned television broadcasters -- the so-called independent stations that compete with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TVS</ENAMEX> was among the fastest-growing because it broadcasts to one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>'s wealthiest regions, the countryside south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>. Its net advertising revenue in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> rose 16% in 1988 to # 166.3 million, and its program sales to other broadcasters boosted total revenue to # 223.6 million.
