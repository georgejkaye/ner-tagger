<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland Corp.</ENAMEX> reported a loss of $13.9 million for its third quarter ended June 30, mainly because of problems in its Australian operations and unrest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
The company was hurt earlier in the year by fraud in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> office.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> is a closely held chain of computer retail outlets, most of which are owned by franchise holders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> franchises sell more computers than any other retailer, with more than $1.9 billion in sales for the nine months ended June 30. Because it issued publicly traded debt last spring, the concern now has to file disclosures with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>.
Its first such report, released yesterday, portrays a company with surging sales but some control problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> has agreed to take over its Australian operation, a joint venture between it and an ex-franchise holder, because of losses discovered by a company audit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. Wade Monroe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX>'s chief financial officer, said the former franchise holder operated the 21 Australian outlets ``with an absence of elementary business sense,'' allowing inventory to almost disappear and spending millions of dollars on ill-fated advertising campaigns and promotions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, the financial reports sent back to headquarters by the former franchise holder masked the extent of the problem, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> had a loss of $14.3 million in the quarter from its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> operations and expects to report another loss in the current quarter. For the nine months, the Australian losses totaled $15.7 million.
For the year-earlier quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> had a loss of $2.2 million, including a $5.3 million loss from discontinued operations.
For the nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX>'s losses totaled $5.1 million. For the year-earlier nine months, the company earned $6.5 million. There weren't any per-share earnings because of preferred dividend requirements. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> got stung by the upheaval in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX> said two trading companies that owed Computerland millions of dollars appear to have been closed down following the Chinese army's attacks against student protesters last summer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>. One of the companies, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX> said had been run by a pro-student businessman who has since fled the country, was seized by the government. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> hasn't been able even to contact the other trading company. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> took a $2.8 million charge in the latest quarter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> also was nicked last spring by an export scam run by employees in its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> office, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX> said. In an apparent effort to pump up sales figures, the employees deliberately evaded <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> law by shipping computers into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> without export licenses, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX> said. That cost Computerland $900,000 in the second quarter ended March 31.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Monroe</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> fired the employees and later closed its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> office, ended its Chinese operations and instituted rigorous controls in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> had a profit of $14.8 million from its other operations, mainly those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
Total retail sales for the quarter from all Computerland franchises rose 28% to $639.7 million from $500.9 million, reflecting booming demand for business computers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computerland</ENAMEX> said. For the nine months, sales rose 27% to $1.9 billion. Because Computerland only recognizes as revenue the royalties paid it by franchise holders and sales from the handful of stores it owns outright, the company's revenue for the quarter as reported in the filing totaled $25.9 million, down from $27.2 million. For the nine months, revenue rose from $92.9 million to $80.6 million.
