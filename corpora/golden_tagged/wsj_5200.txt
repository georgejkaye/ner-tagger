<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston Co.</ENAMEX> officials said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Mine Workers</ENAMEX> have ended their occupation of the company's coal preparation plant.

Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Douglas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX>'s chairman and chief executive officer, has asked Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard M. Metzenbaum</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Labor</ENAMEX> subcommittee, to hold a public hearing on the dispute.
