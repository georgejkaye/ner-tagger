<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International Corp.</ENAMEX>, which for months has tried to fend off charges of alleged misconduct at the Rocky Flats nuclear-weapons plant, said it mutually agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> to turn the facility over to a new contractor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EG&G Inc.</ENAMEX>
The startling announcement came on the heels of a lawsuit filed against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, in which the company claimed to be caught in the middle of an intra-governmental regulatory battle.
The unprecedented legal action asserted, in particular, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> faced a no-win situation: It could keep making bomb parts at Rocky Flats, accordingly churning out a mix of low-level radioactive and hazardous waste that can't legally be stored anywhere. Or it could unilaterally cease operations there and be cited by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> for breaking its contract.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocky Flats</ENAMEX> is important not only because it's the nation's only source of plutonium triggers to explode nuclear warheads, but, with problems at other plants, it's currently the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s sole supplier of plutonium to make new nuclear weapons.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> spokesman said yesterday that the company's hasty exit was prompted specifically by the dilemma it faced over waste disposal. ``That goes right to the heart of the issue,'' he said, adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> hasn't any plans to drop its suit.
However, government officials have grumbled privately over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>'s management of Rocky Flats since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Watkins</ENAMEX> assumed his post earlier this year and declared strict adherence to pollution-control regulations a top priority. Since taking over the plant from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Chemical Co.</ENAMEX> in 1975, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> repeatedly has been castigated by private watchdog groups and internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> reports for lax compliance with environmental and safety rules.
Then in June, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> agents swooped down on Rocky Flats, a huge complex 16 miles outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>. They alleged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> had violated a raft of waste-disposal laws, as well as burned hazardous waste in an incinerator that was supposed to be closed, and dumped noxious chemicals into neighboring streams.
A federal grand jury is considering evidence in the case. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EG&G</ENAMEX> officials will report to Rocky Flats today to begin working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> on a smooth transition, adding that the 5,200 employees there would be retained under the new management.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EG&G</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wellesley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, scientific equipment concern, is itself no stranger to the world of nuclear weapons. The low-profile company already runs the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nevada Test Site</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Idaho National Engineering Lab</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> also has a classified contract), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mound Laboratories</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EG&G</ENAMEX> spokesman pointed out yesterday that the company hasn't finalized its decision to move into Rocky Flats. He said the company's chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Kucharski</ENAMEX>, will be in touch with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Beall</ENAMEX> this week to learn more about the situation at the plant.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> described <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>'s departure from Rocky Flats as a ``no-fault divorce'' in a conversation with Democratic Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Skaggs</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> district includes the 6,550-acre plant site. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skaggs</ENAMEX> said yesterday that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>'s relationship with the agency was already troubled when the company filed suit last week. The litigation ``was the final ingredient in souring things beyond the point of repair,'' he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skaggs</ENAMEX> added that he sees the episode as a healthy signal that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX>'s long-standing coziness with its contractors is turning more adversarial. ``We're really at a fork in the road in terms of the relations,'' he said.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>, its departure is undeniably a blow. While it won't hurt the aerospace giant's balance sheet -- the most it ever made at Rocky Flats in any six-month period was $4.8 million -- corporate executives have talked about the importance of keeping abreast of nuclear technology through its work at the plant.
And there were clearly other benefits for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Segundo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, defense contractor eager to please <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX>. ``They basically have one customer,'' noted a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> financial planner. ``You can call it Army, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, Air Force or DOE.
