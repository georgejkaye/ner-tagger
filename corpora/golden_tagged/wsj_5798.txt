<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX>'s son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques</ENAMEX>, failed in a court attempt to take possession of two million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> shares controlled by his father.
A justice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX> dismissed a motion Friday in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Campeau</ENAMEX>, 35 years old, asked for control of the shares. The shares are held for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Campeau</ENAMEX> in a trust and he is entitled to the dividend income from the shares. But voting rights to the stock are currently controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX>, chairman of the real estate and retailing concern, which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s and other big department store chains.
The shares represent about 7.2% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> common stock held by the elder Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX>, who has a total equity stake of 62.5%, or 54% fully diluted.
In an affidavit filed with the court, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Campeau</ENAMEX> said he is concerned about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s financial condition and the recent drop in its share price. He said he has incurred a ``paper loss'' of 17 million Canadian dollars (US$14.3 million) on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stock recently and he is ``extremely concerned'' that his quarterly dividend income from the shares of about C$200,000 is in jeopardy.
``It is my primary source of income and if it stops or declines substantially I will suffer great hardship,'' the son said in the affidavit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stock ceased trading Wednesday afternoon and hasn't resumed. From Sept. 7 to Sept. 13, the stock fell from C$22.25 to C$13.50/NNP in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> trading.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX> sued his son last year over voting rights to the shares. That case isn't expected to go to trial for several months. The elder Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> also sued his daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rachelle</ENAMEX>, to keep voting rights to 1.6 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> shares held in trust for her.
In documents filed previously with the court, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX> has argued that he is entitled to vote the shares held in trust for his son and daughter and that the stock should remain part of a ``unified voting control block controlled by members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> family or by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX>.
