A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker Corp.</ENAMEX> subsidiary and two of the unit's former senior executives pleaded guilty to bribing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> acquisition official as part of a scheme to obtain electronics contracts totaling more than $7 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker Command & Control Systems</ENAMEX>, as expected, agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines and penalties for its role in funneling illegal payments to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Sherman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">civilian Marine Corps</ENAMEX> official previously convicted of receiving other bribes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> procurement scandal.
In addition to the subsidiary and the two former executives -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Lamberth</ENAMEX>, who was president of the unit, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Van Tassel</ENAMEX>, who was operations director of its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> plant -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Illeman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> consultant, also pleaded guilty to bribery charges involving the unit's successful efforts to garner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> business. All three men agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the continuing grand jury probe of defense contracting.
Yesterday, the grand jury indicted consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Muldoon</ENAMEX>, who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> and allegedly funneled some of the payments to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX>, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX>'s lawyer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Ahern</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX>, who was accused by the grand jury of bribery, conspiracy and other charges, also worked for a batch of larger defense contractors and had close ties to some of the central targets of the investigation.
In an interview yesterday evening, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahern</ENAMEX> said he was told about the grand jury's action but had been informed he wouldn't receive a copy of the charges until this morning. ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> has denied from square one that he bribed anybody,'' the lawyer said. ``That's why we are going to trial on the charges.''
Documents filed by prosecutors in federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, allege a seven-year conspiracy that funneled nearly $80,000 in illicit payments to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX> through a network of consultants, including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Illeman</ENAMEX>. In return, the papers indicate, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX> routinely violated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> acquisition rules, steered lucrative work to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> subsidiary and repeatedly promised to lobby inside the service on the unit's behalf.
According to a company lawyer and court papers, the activities began before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> acquired the unit in 1986 from closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lee Telecommunications.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Afterward</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamberth</ENAMEX> deliberately hid the bribery scheme from officials of the parent company, according to the government's filings.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> unit is the third company to plead guilty to charges stemming from the nearly three-year investigation code-named ``Operation Ill Wind.'' More than 20 defense industry executives, consultants and defense officials also have been convicted.
The criminal charges and other court documents allege that, starting in 1981, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> agreed to secretly share his consulting fees from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX>. Later, the documents indicate, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX> recruited Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Illeman</ENAMEX> to join in by becoming a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> consultant and passing on some of his fees.
The Marine official arranged to personally oversee the company's contracts and negotiated his cut of the consultant fees, according to court documents.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX>, who received an 18-month prison term for taking other bribes, helped Lee get a $600,000 contract in 1982 to build computers for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> traffic-control and communications system. He also authorized several modifications for the work that increased the value of the company's contracts by more than $2.6 million, according to court papers.
The documents indicate that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX> ``agreed to continue to look after {the company's} interests regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> contracts,'' in one case receiving cash directly from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamberth</ENAMEX>.
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whittaker</ENAMEX> took control of the unit, according to court filings, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> allegedly complained about the legal risks he was running and the others agreed on a new system to pay the consultant in one lump sum. According to court filings, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Tassel</ENAMEX> agreed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muldoon</ENAMEX> would provide a ``study'' for Whittaker to justify the $36,000 payment. In fact, the filings say, the entire study came from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX>'s files.
