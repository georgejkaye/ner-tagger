Although I am one of the two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> faculty members quoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles J. Sykes</ENAMEX> (``Where Liberal Arts Starve Amid Federal Plenty,'' editorial page, Sept. 6), I have never spoken to him. The quotation was lifted from a Jan. 25 article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronicle of Higher Education</ENAMEX>. I can not imagine that the Journal would ever use an eight-month-old remark by an executive to characterize the current health of his corporation.
Outlooks can change rapidly in the academic world, too, and I and many of my colleagues are now optimistic about the fiscal and scholarly prospects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins School of Arts and Sciences</ENAMEX>. The worst is past, and the world looks much brighter than it did a year ago.
The classics department, for example, far from being ``beleaguered,'' has just added a new faculty member and is advertising a prestigious new chair to be filled this year. It expects to fill another chair next year, and make one other appointment. The university's commitment to the classics is unwavering.

As an alumnus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">B.A.</ENAMEX>'81'81), I read Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sykes</ENAMEX>'s article with great interest. He is painfully correct in most matters -- with one exception.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX>'s academics are unsurpassed. Even though the school's reputation is that of a science haven, the liberal arts have the highest ranked departments (according to the Gourman Reports, the departments of history, English and art history are ranked in the top 10 in the country -- the basic sciences are a few notches lower). But the university has done a poor job of promoting its own best qualities. In fact, the undergraduate application literature takes on an apologetic tone for excelling in the humanities, simply because the incorrect reputation is that of a pre-med colony.
With accessible teachers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Barth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Macksey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Kenner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Lynn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Walters</ENAMEX>, a school should brag about its strength in the liberal arts rather than laugh at the stereotype that prohibits a greater pool of liberal-arts applicants.
The school could be one of the great undergraduate schools, but with the little sense of community spirit offered, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> will remain a first-class university that many students avoid.

Try some shocking facts:
-- The U.S. has become increasingly less competitive and productive in a global economy. One reason is our failure to do enough research, especially non-defense-related research.
-- Universities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> provide the best education available in the world, but they are underfunded for their mission. They will be unable to support research and students as they have in the past, if federal policies continue to increasingly squeeze their budgets.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sykes</ENAMEX> is concerned about the future of the liberal arts. More power to him. But if we listen to his imprecations about universities' efforts to foster graduate education and research, we will convince ourselves that demolition is creation and penury wealth.

While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins</ENAMEX> began at the top, its various programs had their ups and downs with only one exception: classics. The founding professor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil Gildersleeve</ENAMEX>, was a great scholar. So were his successors. Students in the department were devoted to a degree I have never seen in any other department anywhere. Outstanding graduates and doctors came through it.
In recent years the department repeatedly nominated for promotion its brilliant, young, untenured professors, but the administration did not promote them. They went away. When the sky is polluted, stars are hard to see.
