At age eight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine Baker</ENAMEX> was sent by her mother to a white woman's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal.
At age 19, she was a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> sensation, transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade. It is the stuff of dreams, but also of traumas. Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters. And, for Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, the ride was far from over.
Her bare breasts, her dancing, her voice, her beauty and, perhaps most famously, her derriere, were prominent attractions, but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bricktop</ENAMEX>, another American black woman who found a measure of fame in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, said: ``I don't think I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life, or whose life was more complicated than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Josephine</ENAMEX>'s.''
Men were a constant complication. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had lots of them. But she didn't trust them and didn't reward trust. As she saw one key love affair, the problem wasn't her infidelity, it was his jealousy.
Her appetite for children also was large. She adopted 12 of assorted races, naming them the Rainbow Tribe, and driving her husband first to despair and then to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>.
She made money, but spent more. Friends pitched in. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Rainier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Princess Grace</ENAMEX> saved her with the offer of a house in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monaco</ENAMEX>.
Another lifelong complication, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Rose</ENAMEX> makes clear in ``Jazz Cleopatra: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine Baker</ENAMEX> in Her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doubleday</ENAMEX>, 321 pages, $22.50), was racism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had the good luck to arrive in 1925 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, where blacks had become exotic. African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks. To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized, but for the most part <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> was a friendly island in a racist world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had bitter experience of bigotry from her <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> childhood and her days in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> theater, where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line (performing of course for all-white audiences).
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> loved her at first sight. ``She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her,'' sniffed the literary world's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Jolas</ENAMEX>, not entirely inaccurately. ``One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> writes. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>, who teaches literature at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesleyan University</ENAMEX>, quickly proceeds to overemphasize, claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s dancing ``had uncovered a new region for desire'' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous.
``Jazz <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX>'' contains other, more important, false notes that undermine what is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works. It is easy to see why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women, attracts Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>, the author of ``Parallel Lives,'' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage.
Still, even the title raises questions about the author's vision of her subject. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term. To find parallels, other than sexual appeal, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX>, requires an equal stretch.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> was 68 years old when she died in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show: a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life. In fact, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> played scenes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Casablanca</ENAMEX> that could have made it into ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Casablanca</ENAMEX>.''
During World War II, her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted, a decision made by only about 2% of French citizens. She was devoted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles de Gaulle</ENAMEX>'s cause, accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphrey Bogart</ENAMEX>'s nightclub, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Laszlo</ENAMEX> leads Free French sympathizers in ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Marseillaise</ENAMEX>'' to drown out the Nazis. The night the Germans occupied all of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Casablanca</ENAMEX>. The Free French wore black arm bands, and when she sang ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J</ENAMEX>'ai <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J</ENAMEX>'ai deux amours'' they wept.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> is best on the early years and World War II. In her introduction, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> writes that she feels she has much in common with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, but as ``Jazz <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cleopatra</ENAMEX>'' goes on, it seems more rushed, as though the author were growing less interested. It doesn't help that sometimes Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>'s language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want. One chapter opens: ``World War II was not one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s glorious moments.''
Elsewhere, in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> writes: ``She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman.''
One devoted fan who fell under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s spell in 1963 and began collecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> memorabilia was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Hammond</ENAMEX>. In ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Josephine Baker</ENAMEX>'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Cape</ENAMEX>, 304 pages, $35), which was published in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> last year and distributed in the U.S. this month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammond</ENAMEX> has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star. The text by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick O'Connor</ENAMEX> is a tough read, but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Hemingway</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> ``The most sensational woman anybody ever saw. Or ever will.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lescaze</ENAMEX> is foreign editor of the Journal.
