<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redland PLC</ENAMEX>, a major British building-materials supplier, said its pretax profit for the first six months of the year rose 18%, largely through greater contributions from associated companies to the group's balance sheet and moderate improvements in overseas markets.
Pretax profit in the period was # 104.1 million ($168.2 million), up from # 88.2 million a year earlier. Earnings per share rose 24% to 25.7 pence from 20.8 pence.
Profit after tax and minority interests, or profit attributable to shareholders, rose 25% to # 70.5 million from # 56.6 million. Charges for minority interests totaled # 6.5 million, down 13% from # 7.5 million in the year-earlier period.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redland</ENAMEX> didn't have any extraordinary items in the periods.
The first-time inclusion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western-Mobile Inc.</ENAMEX>'s full results and receipts from its newly acquired 49% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australian</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monier PGH Ltd.</ENAMEX> underpinned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redland</ENAMEX>'s pretax returns.
A year earlier, Redland included returns from Western-Mobile based on a 50% stake it held in the company. It took full control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>-based company at the end of June 1988. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monier PGH</ENAMEX> was created in December.
Operating profit was # 51.3 million, up 11% from # 46.1 million. First-half sales of # 694 million were down 18% from # 848.8 million a year earlier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redland</ENAMEX> said the drop in sales was the result of its December sale of a United Kingdom fuel-distribution business.
Associated companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monier PGH</ENAMEX>, contributed # 106.5 million to total sales, up 80% from # 59.3 million a year earlier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> operations supplied # 237 million to total sales, up 23% from # 192.1 million. And overseas subsidiaries, including Western-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mobile</ENAMEX>, has sales totaling # 350.5 million, up 13% from # 310.8 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redland</ENAMEX> said results in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> varied by sector, with its aggregate business performing well because of enhanced activity in major road, rail and water projects. Brick sales, however, have been pressured by high interest rates and the related downturn in housing construction and repair activity.
It added that the company should be buffered to some extent by growth in continental European and Australian markets and relative stability in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redland</ENAMEX> also said it should be further cushioned by its diversification away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> housing market, which accounted for just 15% of profit in the first half.
