<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera Corp.</ENAMEX> agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX Corp.</ENAMEX> for stock valued at $31.98 a share, or $561 million, apparently marking the first time a Japanese company has bought a U.S. concern entirely for stock.
Kazuo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inamori</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX>, a maker of ceramic packages for semiconductors, said in an interview that he wanted to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX> for stock partly because of trade frictions between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> He said he wanted to emphasize that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX>, a maker of electronic components, was a partner that would remain intact.
``When we buy with cash, there is a connotation -- certainly in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and maybe in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, as well -- that we bought the company, it is ours and we can do anything with it,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inamori</ENAMEX> said through an interpreter. ``That certainly is not the spirit of this arrangement.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John O'Herron</ENAMEX>, a general partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazard Freres & Co.</ENAMEX>, which helped represent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX>, said he thought this could lead to similar acquisitions because it could show Japanese companies how to limit the predatory image they sometimes have in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inamori</ENAMEX> also has argued that Japanese companies need to take the initiative in buying parts from U.S. companies and moving manufacturing to the U.S.
In fact, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inamori</ENAMEX> said he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall D. Butler</ENAMEX>, who have known each other for almost 30 years, initially talked about having AVX make some parts for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX>, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX> has almost no manufacturing capacity. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kyoto</ENAMEX>, generates just $200 million of its $2.5 billion of annual sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX> wants to expand there before internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> trade barriers come down in 1992.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inamori</ENAMEX> said the decision to purchase the company for stock faced some obstacles, notably that Japanese law forbids subsidiaries from owning stock in the parent. But he said he interceded with Japanese ministries and won ``a liberal interpretation of the rules.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> said he agreed to the purchase because it would give AVX access to a broad line of parts that it could sell in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX> currently generates 25% of its $408 million of annual sales. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> also cited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX>'s technology; while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX> both make capacitors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX> also makes a broad line of electronics, including printer heads, liquid crystal displays and personal computers.
In addition, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX>'s stock was undervalued. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX> stock surged $8 yesterday to close at $29.625 in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
If the necessary governmental approvals are received and a majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX> holders accept, each share of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX> will be exchanged for 0.39 Kyocera American depositary receipts. The Adrs, each of which represents two shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyocera</ENAMEX> common stock, closed yesterday at $80.625 in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, up 12.5 cents.
The number of Adrs exchanged will be increased if their average closing price remains below $82 during the 15 days beginning a month before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVX</ENAMEX> shareholders vote on the acquisition, probably in late December.
