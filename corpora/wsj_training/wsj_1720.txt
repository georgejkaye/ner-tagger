Three savings-and-loan institutions in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> were added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX>'s conservatorship program after federal regulators declared the thrifts insolvent and named the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> their receiver.
The deposits, assets and certain liabilities of the three thrifts were transferred to newly chartered federal mutual institutions.
The three institutions are: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid Kansas Federal Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wichita</ENAMEX>, which had $830.5 million in assets; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mcallen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mcallen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, with $582.6 million in assets; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surety Savings Association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Paso</ENAMEX>, with $309.3 million in assets.
The three insolvent thrifts will maintain normal business hours and operations under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX>-appointed managing agents, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> tries to negotiate permanent resolutions.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, was closed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> banking officials. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> approved the assumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century</ENAMEX>'s deposits and fully secured liabilities by a newly chartered subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Capital Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>. The new institution is also called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Century Bank</ENAMEX>, and the failed bank's five offices will reopen today.
The failed bank had assets of about $129.6 million. The newly chartered bank will assume about $125.7 million in 10,300 deposit accounts and pay the FDIC a purchase premium of $2.9 million. It also will buy about $91.7 million of assets, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDIC</ENAMEX> will advance $31.8 million to the assuming bank.
