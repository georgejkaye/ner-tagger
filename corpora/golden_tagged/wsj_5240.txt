A $250 million emergency loan agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX>, reached earlier this week, has set the stage for what may develop into a nasty battle between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and its bondholders.
In addition to making the loan, which will be used primarily to buy inventory at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> agreed to participate in the refinancing of an $800 million bridge loan due in April 1990. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>, however, made that participation conditional on the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s as well as the redemption of 75% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied and Federated</ENAMEX> debentures, notes and preferred stock by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> at Sept. 15 prices.
What has bondholders riled is that prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied and Federated</ENAMEX> issues were at basement levels that day, selling for as little as half par value.
The implied threat is that without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s participation in the $800 million refinancing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied and Federated</ENAMEX> will be forced to seek court protection under Chapter 11 of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Bankruptcy Code. Such a move would immediately depress <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Allied</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Federated</ENAMEX> junk bonds, which aren't secured by tangible assets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bondholders</ENAMEX>, who asked not to be identified, said they wouldn't sell their bonds at the Sept. 15 levels and described <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s refinancing terms as a gambit for increasing the equity stake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> shareholders. After the $250 million cash transfusion, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> will own 38.4% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> on a fully diluted basis while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX>, chairman, will retain 43.2%.
``It's a negotiating ploy, nothing more,'' said one Federated bondholder. ``Why would <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> go into Chapter 11 after investing $250 million? It's a way for them to drive down bond prices. We won't sell at Sept. 15 levels, and I don't think anybody else will, either.''
A second Federated bondholder concurred. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> has been trying to refinance that $800 million bridge loan for some time now,'' he said. ``This is a way for them to do it while driving down bond prices. Nobody will sell for less than market value.''
Those close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> and familiar with the agreement said bargaining over the buy-back price for 75% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Allied</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Federated</ENAMEX> junk bonds will be a ``game of chicken.''
Until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> stepped in with the emergency funding, said one source, the junk bondholders were faced with getting nothing on the dollar for their high-risk investment. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> would have gone into Chapter 11 without that funding,'' he said. ``If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> is going to step up to the plate for a second time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> wants the junk-bond holders to give up something.'' He noted that bondholders who have the remaining 25% could participate if the company's fortunes later improve.
According to the source, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> isn't keen to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> slide into Chapter 11 because it would lose on its common-share investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> doesn't want to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s retailing side sink after it pours another $250 million into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s 38.4% fully-diluted stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> consists of 5.23 million common shares, about $550 million in convertible debentures and warrants, and a $75 million loan secured against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s 50%-stake in its flagship office tower, the 68-story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotia Plaza</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>'s financial district. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> owns the other half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotia Plaza.</ENAMEX>
The $800 million bridge loan in question was originally provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> as part of the $6.6 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> in May 1988. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> then syndicated most of that bridge loan to other banks. The loan was due to be repaid this January but has been extended three months.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Leinoff</ENAMEX>, senior securities analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccarthy Crisanti & Maffei Inc.</ENAMEX>, described the prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied and Federated</ENAMEX> bonds on Sept. 15 as at ``panic levels'' but said it wasn't surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> would initially make a lowball offer.
``There's nothing wrong with trying to buy that way,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leinoff</ENAMEX>. ``But it's hard to say whether they'll return with a higher offer. Part of the problem is that they are so unpredictable at this point. It causes uncertainty in the marketplace as to whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> will continue as entities, confusion as to how the bonds should be valued, and uncertainty as to management at both chains. Uncertainty is the operating word here.''
Those close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> insist that the company won't help fund a new $800 million bridge loan unless 75% of the outstanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> bonds are redeemed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, however, appears confident that financing to repay that bridge loan will be found with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y.</ENAMEX> ``We have other options,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> spokesman. ``An agreement in place can be amended, even though we think the redemption plan is workable.
