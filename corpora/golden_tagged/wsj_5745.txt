U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth L. Ryskamp</ENAMEX> ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Customs Service</ENAMEX> to return some 210 Cuban paintings seized last March from art collector <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramon Cernuda</ENAMEX>.
The controversial case was the subject of a Wall Street Journal front page article in August.
In finding for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cernuda</ENAMEX>, the judge ruled that selling or exhibiting Cuban paintings are activities protected under the First Amendment and are therefore exempt from regulation under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trading</ENAMEX> With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enemy Act</ENAMEX>, which bars most trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>.
``It's a home run on all counts,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cernuda</ENAMEX>, who alleged that he had been the subject of a prosecution motivated by conservative and politically influential segments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> exile community.
The judge said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cernuda</ENAMEX> had been a victim of ``selective enforcement'' since he has been ``the only art dealer subjected to government seizure of his collection.'' Auction houses such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s claim they hadn't realized that they had to acquire licenses to auction works by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban</ENAMEX> artists from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury Department</ENAMEX> before the Cernuda controversy broke, the judge said.
The judge found that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cernuda</ENAMEX>, who bought his paintings from the two auction houses as well as two diplomats, hadn't traded ``with the enemy,'' as had been alleged by the government.
U.S. Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dexter Lehtinen</ENAMEX> said he hadn't seen the decision and therefore couldn't comment.
