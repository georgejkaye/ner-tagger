<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quickview Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> said it filed a lawsuit against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX>, claiming patent infringement in an element of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s popular Hypercard software program.
The suit, filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> federal court, claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that allows computer users to display ``only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hypercard</ENAMEX> program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without having to be hardcore programmers and is distributed with every Macintosh sold. It's one of the most popular computer programs of all time, but analysts said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quickview</ENAMEX> suit doesn't appear to bode major difficulties for Apple.
The technology at issue ``is not an underlying technology of Hypercard to my knowledge,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Goodman</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-area Hypercard program developer.
Nonetheless, the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quickview</ENAMEX> claimed could run into the millions of dollars.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cupertino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, Apple said that it believes the case has no merit, and that Hypercard does not infringe ``any valid claims'' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quickview</ENAMEX> patents. It said it filed an action of its own in federal court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Jose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, seeking a declaration that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quickview</ENAMEX>'s claims are invalid.
