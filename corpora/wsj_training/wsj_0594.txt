Computers that once were
the state of the art,
The marvels bought three
years ago,
Are now obsolete. As we
queasily start
The search for replacements,
we know
The new one we purchase in
hopes it will do,
Despite every wonder that's
stated,
Means more speed, more
graphics, more memory,
too,
But also more quickly out -

I know when dividends are
due;
When bonds should be retired;
But what gets by me every
time
Is has the milk expired?
