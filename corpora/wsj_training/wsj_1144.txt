<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville Corp.</ENAMEX> said it offered to buy $500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust</ENAMEX> in a move that would improve the trust's liquidity and reduce the potential number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> shares outstanding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value. It said it would purchase the stock at market price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision hasn't been made. ``We are considering that offer along with all other alternatives,'' the trust spokeswoman said. ``We need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries.''
The trust, created as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, owns 7.2 million of the Series A convertible preferred shares, which are each convertible into 10 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> common shares. The trust also owns half of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s 48 million common shares outstanding.
Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s closing price yesterday of $9.25 a share, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares, or about 75% of the trust's preferred stock holding.
In addition to the stock and 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>'s profits beginning in 1992, the trust is supposed to receive $2.5 billion over its 27-year life. But it initially was funded with about $765 million and may soon face a cash crunch. As of June 30, it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $136 million, a large portion of its $268 million in cash and marketable securities. Since most of its assets are tied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX>, a forest and building products concern, the trust might also want to diversify its holdings.
As part of its offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> to ``reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure.'' A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the proposed changes. But he said they are ``to a large degree, housekeeping,'' although some may generate some disagreement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold, as needed, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manville</ENAMEX> has the right of first refusal to buy those shares.
