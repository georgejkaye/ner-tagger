<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Federal Savings Bank</ENAMEX> and two of its former officers were named in a 43-count indictment charging the thrift with fraud in connection with government-backed student loans.
The indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Federal</ENAMEX> and the former officers attempted to defraud the U.S. of about $35 million by presenting false insurance claims on guaranteed student loans to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Education</ENAMEX> in 1986 and 1987.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Education</ENAMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guaranteed Student Loan Program</ENAMEX>, makes low-interest loans available to students to help pay for their education. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lenders</ENAMEX>' funds are used; the federal government or a guarantee agency insures against any loss due to default.
The investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Federal</ENAMEX> began in early 1988 and helped trigger a management shake-up.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Federal</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John W. Sapanski</ENAMEX>, said the indictment ``goes way beyond what is warranted and reasonable,'' adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida Federal</ENAMEX> itself disclosed the initial problems. He said the bank has been negotiating a settlement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>.
Named as co-defendants were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert O. Harmas</ENAMEX>, 42, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Noblesville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James J. Lamantia</ENAMEX>, 59, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Largo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla</ENAMEX>. Neither could be reached for comment.
