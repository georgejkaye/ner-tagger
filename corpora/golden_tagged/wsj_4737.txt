<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par Pharmaceutical Inc.</ENAMEX>, the generic-drug maker that has been plagued by management problems and a government investigation, said it named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth I. Sawyer</ENAMEX> as interim president and chief executive officer.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> spokesman said a committee was continuing its search for a permanent successor for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry Levine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX>'s president, who retired. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX>, 68 years old, announced his intention to retire in August. The company said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levine</ENAMEX> told the board Friday that his physician advised him to retire as soon as possible. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> is under consideration for the permanent position, a spokesman said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> is a lawyer who Par said has ``extensive experience'' in the generic-drug industry. He most recently was vice president, general counsel at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldline Labs</ENAMEX>, a closely held generic-drug company in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>
In a statement, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> said he wanted to ``restore confidence that we will conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical and professional standards.''
In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX>, 43, emphasized that while the titles of president and chief executive carry the designation ``interim,'' he said, ``my charge of responsibility is not to make this an interim job.'' While he was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldline</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> said he worked both as general counsel and as president of one of its subsidiaries, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bioline Laboratories</ENAMEX>, so that he has experience in management, sales and marketing of a generic-drug company.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> said he thought Par presented ``an excellent challenge'' because of what he called its good foundation. Asked how he plans to achieve his stated goal of restoring confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Par</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX> said the company would continue with its independent audits, and pointed out that as far as anyone can tell, Par wasn't dealing with a safety problem.
``This company needs to become what I call self-regulating,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sawyer</ENAMEX>. ``The best way to deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> is to do their job for them,'' he said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> has been investigating Par as part of an inquiry into the generic-drug industry. Par in August suspended shipments of all of its generic drugs in tablet and capsule form after some potential manufacturing problems were raised. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Par</ENAMEX> has been gradually reintroducing products to market as they clear company reviews. The spokesman said he didn't know the percentage of products that have been reintroduced, but that it is ``smaller than 50%.'' He said reintroducing products is a lengthy process.
Two weeks ago, a federal judge ordered the former president of a Par subsidiary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc.</ENAMEX>, to pay a $250,000 fine and perform 12 months of community service. The former official, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dilip Shah</ENAMEX>, had pleaded guilty to a charge of paying an illegal gratuity of $1,000 to a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">FDA</ENAMEX> branch chief who reviewed newdrug applications.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sentencing</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Par</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quad</ENAMEX>, which both pleaded guilty to one count of paying an illegal gratuity to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> official, was postponed until next month. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashok Patel</ENAMEX>, a former Par senior vice president who pleaded guilty to giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> official about $500, also will be sentenced next month.
