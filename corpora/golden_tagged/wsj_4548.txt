<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> suddenly grounded its fleet of planes, triggering speculation the once high-flying carrier would file for bankruptcy-law proceedings for the second time this decade.
A person familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s plans said a Chapter 11 filing was probable as early as this morning in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, where the company recently moved its headquarters. The airline's lightning-like cancellation of flights and widespread talk of a court filing baffled airline-industry officials. But they pointed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s weakening financial position, caused -- ironically -- by overly aggressive expansion after emerging from its bankruptcy reorganization in the early 1980s.
Last night, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said that she couldn't confirm the airline was planning a bankruptcy-law filing. She added that she didn't yet know the airline's plans, and she and others declined throughout the evening to answer any questions about any of yesterday's activities. Other people familiar with the situation said corporate directors met last night in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COR Holdings Inc.</ENAMEX>, abruptly began canceling flights at 2 p.m. yesterday, and employees at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kan.</ENAMEX>, hubs were sent home. Industry officials said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> aircraft arriving at those airports remained grounded.
An official at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>'s airport, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> flies about 25 flights a day, said the airline told her only that flights were canceled for yesterday afternoon. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Desrosiers</ENAMEX>, director of community relations at the airport, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> didn't tell her anything about flights today.
Pilots telephoning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s scheduling office were told not to report to work and that the airline is scaling back operations, and eventually expects to fly only its 20 or so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 727s.
One source said the company, ranked 13th among the nation's 22 carriers based on capacity, will attempt yet another comeback as an even smaller carrier. After slashing service, it hopes to gradually resume flights to 16 cities instead of the 40 it served until yesterday. Included are typically high-volume destinations -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nev</ENAMEX>. Also in the plan are <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> and greatly reduced service through its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> hub.
A top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> executive yesterday reassured worried <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> municipal officials that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> has no plans to permanently close down. ``He told me that they are in the process of redoing and rescheduling the airline to create a viable, healthy airline,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Lewellen</ENAMEX>, chairman of the city's aviation committee.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> officials remained closeted in meetings much of the day, and didn't return telephone calls seeking comment. Their silence did nothing to quell the rumors that roared through the airline industry. ``We have had an unconfirmed report that they have filed Chapter 11,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lora Manlove</ENAMEX>, a travel agent at Ask Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>. She said her travel agency began protecting all its clients booked on Braniff by rescheduling them on other airlines. ``Everybody is,'' she said, referring to other travel agencies.
A check of courts in several cities that might be likely venues for a Braniff bankruptcy-law filing disclosed none. Still, rumors of an impending bankruptcy-law filing swept <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>, knocking down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s stock. The shares closed at $3, down $1.75, in over-the-counter trading.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> has been on shaky footing throughout the 1980s. In what was then a historic filing, the company in a move not unlike today's suddenly closed down operations in May 1982 and then filed for bankruptcy-law proceedings. At that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> also was regarded as a victim of over-ambition as it leaped into the fray of the newly deregulated airline industry.
In its heyday, the airline made expansion moves as flashy as its planes, one of which was painted by renowned artist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Calder</ENAMEX>. Its flight attendants wore uniforms by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gucci</ENAMEX> and seats on all its planes were made of leather.
The bargain-hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> bought Braniff while it was still in bankruptcy court in 1983, and the once-proud airline returned to the skies in 1984. But it began its comeback attempt almost too fast. Critics said it tried too much service to too many destinations at once and had to back off.
Then, last year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pritzker</ENAMEX> family sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> for $105 million to a group led by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Chodorow</ENAMEX>. The transaction was arranged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, which received a minority holding. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chodorow</ENAMEX> installed as senior management three executives freshly departed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piedmont Aviation</ENAMEX>, which had been bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair Group Inc.</ENAMEX>
Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> once again moved for quick expansion, part of a strategy by its new chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William G. Mcgee</ENAMEX>, to transform the carrier into a $1 billion-a-year airline by 1991. In January, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> unveiled plans to acquire as much as $3 billion of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus Industrie</ENAMEX> planes. Then it moved its corporate headquarters to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>. And just two weeks ago, it agreed to lease $600 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737-300 aircraft. Earlier it had concentrated its flights into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> left, complaining it was racking up losses of $1.5 million a day.
In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> blamed efforts to restructure its fleet and to build its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> hub for the $42.8 million loss it posted for the six months ended July 31. That was almost a dozen times larger than the $3.6 million deficit of a year earlier, even though revenue rose to $293 million from $226.5 million.
Earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> announced still more plans to increase its flights out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, to 101 from 93. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, the carrier planned to have over 200 flights operating out of the city.
Calls yesterday to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s passenger-reservation number illustrated the confusion caused by the sudden halt in service. A reservations employee said there were some canceled flights but didn't know how many. The airline ``isn't telling us a number,'' he said. ``I have been getting some irate calls'' from customers. Another employee at the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> reservation center said she hadn't received any explanation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> management. Repeated efforts to reach the toll-free reservation number late last night resulted in busy signals or no answer.
In sharp contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s 1982 grounding, when it stranded travelers and caused considerable ill will, the airline this time apparently made some effort to minimize such damage. It sent a message through its computer reservation system instructing managers at various airports to switch customers showing up for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braniff</ENAMEX> flights to ``preferred carriers'' such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midway Airlines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America West Airlines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaska Air Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usair</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>, like most carriers, has certain ticket-transfer arrangements with other airlines.
In recent weeks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> had been cutting fares, such as reducing its seven-day advance-purchase fare between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX> to $176 from $236. Executives at other airlines said they wouldn't match the reductions, viewing them as a distress signal rather than a competitive threat.
