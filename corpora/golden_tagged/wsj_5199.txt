Democrats in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> may be desperate to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> break his no-new-taxes pledge, but beyond the Beltway a lot of Democrats don't think that makes either political or economic sense. The two Democrats who won special elections for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> last week both made clear their aversion to taxes. And now in liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lt.</ENAMEX> Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelyn Murphy</ENAMEX> has broken with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Dukakis</ENAMEX> and is promising no increase in taxes for four years if she is elected governor. She would even force state agencies to accept budget cuts of up to 5% in order to keep her pledge. The difference between the ``national'' Democrats and state and local Democrats appears to be growing ever greater.
