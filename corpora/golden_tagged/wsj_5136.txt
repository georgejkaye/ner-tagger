<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank System Inc.</ENAMEX>, ailing from a series of management missteps in recent years, said its board launched a search for a new chief executive officer and that current chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.H. Ankeny Jr.</ENAMEX> stepped aside immediately.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>-based banking concern in recent years has had a $500 million bond portfolio loss, big loan losses and high turnover among its executive ranks. Those problems led to speculation in recent months that the board would replace the 56-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ankeny</ENAMEX>.
In a brief statement, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ankeny</ENAMEX> conceded he isn't the best person to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> around: ``Given the challenges the organization faces, I've determined that it is in the best interest of shareholders and employees that I resign'' as chairman, president and chief executive. He didn't elaborate.
The four-year tenure of the brewery-scion-turned-banker was marked by a willingness to take big risks -- ones he apparently didn't always fully understand. By far the worst was holding onto an $8 billion government bond position through rising interest rates during 1987 in the hope that rates would decline; rates didn't and the value of the bonds fell more than $700 million in nine months. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> has never fully recovered from the gamble, which led to a $506.3 million write-off last year.
The bond debacle had been preceded by an ill-conceived lending binge -- much of it outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX>'s native territory -- that led to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darrell G. Knudson</ENAMEX>, 52, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> vice chairman with senior experience mostly in running the company's smaller banks across the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX>, was named acting chief executive officer while the board conducts its search.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willis A. Strauss</ENAMEX>, head of the board's personnel committee and a retired chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enron Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>, couldn't be reached for comment at his office or home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ankeny</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Knudson</ENAMEX> wouldn't be interviewed yesterday, a spokeswoman said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank's</ENAMEX> stock rose 50 cents after the news yesterday to close at $20.625 in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
``This is going to be positive for the company,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Puglisi</ENAMEX>, a bank stock analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keefe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bruyette & Woods Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. He said the problems had sapped management's credibility. ``Some fresh blood is just what the company needs right now.''
The search for a new chief executive, however, could be frustrating. The banking industry is ``very thin'' on proven turnaround managers, asserted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windle B. Priem</ENAMEX>, an executive recruiter specializing in banks at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korn/Ferry International</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priem</ENAMEX> said he isn't involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> search.
What's more, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> has lost stature in recent years as more robust regional banking concerns around the country passed it by in size, profits and stock market value.
Earlier this week, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX> disclosed that it is considering lopping off big parts of its business in a restructuring that would idle as many as 2,000 of its more than 10,000 employees and reduce assets $2 billion, to about $20 billion. The company wouldn't comment, but any such big restructuring probably would be put on hold until a new chief executive signs on.
The company also disclosed fresh problems in its leveraged buy-out loan portfolio Monday.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Puglisi</ENAMEX> now worries that a new chief executive will come in and discover yet more problem loans, as is often the case when banks change managements. He and other analysts slashed profit estimates for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Bank</ENAMEX>.
