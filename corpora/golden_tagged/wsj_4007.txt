Quantum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical Corp.</ENAMEX> reported that a second worker died from an explosion and a fire at the company's commodity chemical plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Morris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> has said the Sept. 12 incident began when a heat exchanger burst. One worker was killed at the time of the blast. The company said six persons remain hospitalized. Meanwhile, various government agencies continue to investigate the accident.
The company estimates pretax losses from the accident will be $15 million. It said it is insured against other losses from property damage, business interruption and liability claims.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> added, though, that the amount of the losses from business interruption must still be negotiated with its insurers. The negotiations will include assessments of how market conditions would have affected Quantum's sales if its production hadn't been curtailed.
The company said it doesn't expect to resume making ethylene at the plant until early in 1990, but it does plan to start limited production of polyethylene and polypropylene at that plant this month.
Although the facility is only one of six chemical complexes operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX>, it accounts for 50% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based company's ethylene production and 20% to 25% of its polyethylene production.
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX> officials met with securities analysts Friday, the company's stock slid $2.625 to close at $36.625 a share in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. Some analysts said they felt that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hoyt Stookey</ENAMEX>, gave evasive answers to questions about the chance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum</ENAMEX>'s cutting its quarterly dividend, currently 75 cents a share.
A company spokesman later declined to comment on the dividend.
