The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> passed a bill that would improve cooperation in insider-trading cases between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> and foreign governments.
The bill, passed by voice vote, would expand last year's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insider Trading</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Fraud Enforcement Act</ENAMEX> to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> to receive information from foreign governments without subjecting that information to U.S. disclosure laws.
That point had been a stumbling block to foreign cooperation, because many countries with secrecy rules declined to pass along sensitive information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> agency for fear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> would be forced to release it under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Freedom of Information Act</ENAMEX>.
The bill also would permit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> and the exchanges to sanction individuals and firms on foreign securities-laws violations, closing a loophole that allowed the U.S. to be used as a refuge from foreign charges.
``This bill recognizes that as the financial world grows ever smaller through the process of globalization, the reach of enforcement of securities laws must grow larger,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Markey</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>), who introduced the bill.
Last week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> passed a similar measure as part of a broader package of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> legislation. That bill is expected to pass the full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> later this year.
