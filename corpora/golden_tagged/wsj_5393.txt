<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> investigators have reported that employees at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli Lilly & Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> plant submitted false or incomplete data to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> on some of the drugs it made.
In two instances, investigators wrote, the plant failed to report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> that drugs failed tests for stability. Such tests indicate a drug's ability to work as promised after a certain amount of time.
Congressional investigators said they plan to examine those and other incidents cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> investigators. ``It's fair to say the committee is looking at that,'' said a staff member of the investigations subcommittee of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX>. ``That goes to the question of obfuscation.''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> spokesman said the incidents were ``technical aberrations'' and that the company is addressing them in its plan to fix the problems at the plant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> has said it's reviewing its manufacturing operations and its goal is to ``address all of the issues raised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>.'' Last week, it halted the distribution of all drugs made at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> plant and recalled 10 drugs.
In a related development, subcommittee Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John D. Dingell</ENAMEX> late yesterday asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> for copies of company documents and records of inspections of its facilities from 1985 to the present, including a list of management at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> plant. In a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard D. Wood</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> report ``confirmed that callous and cavalier business practices were commonplace'' in the plant.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> spokesman said he couldn't comment because the company had not yet seen the letter.
Last week, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dingell</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> for inspection records of more than 50 Lilly manufacturing plants. That request came in the wake of the investigators' findings of widespread problems at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> plant, which makes drug tablets and capsules. The examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>, one of the biggest makers of brand-name drugs, marked a broadening of the subcommittee's investigation. It had been investigating alleged wrongdoing by makers of generic drugs.
Although an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> spokesman said the investigation found ``a number of objectionable practices,'' he said they are different from those found in the investigation of generic drug makers. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> officials said they have no evidence of fraud at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>.
In the stability tests, investigators said that four lots of the antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ilotycin</ENAMEX> showed failures for moisture, but that reports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> didn't mention that. They also found that a 1985 Lilly report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> extended the expiration date for the drug to four years from two even though stability for the marketed lots had those failures.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moisture</ENAMEX> is one of a number of tests to check stability. Too much moisture, for example, can make a drug degrade more quickly and thus hurt its effectiveness. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> spokesman said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilotycin</ENAMEX> wasn't recalled and that the company considers the drug safe.
In a separate incident, the investigators said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lilly</ENAMEX> signed off on a validation for Darvon compound two years late and four days after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> started its investigation in April. They said the sign-off was contrary to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX>'s standard operating procedures and was done even though the product had long since been recalled.
Darvon compound is made up of the painkiller Darvon plus aspirin and caffeine.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> has said the report doesn't call into question the safety or effectiveness of any of its products.
``They may be right,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney Wolfe</ENAMEX>, who, as director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Citizen Health Research Group</ENAMEX>, has been a vocal critic of drug companies. ``But if the company continued such widespread violations of the way drugs should be manufactured... sooner or later they might cause a lot of injuries.''
The investigators also reported two instances when employees apparently signed records without seeing the processing steps they were verifying.
One instance involved weighing a batch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darvocet</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 50, another painkiller. Accurate weights are such a vital part of the drug-making process that a second person is required to verify the weights.
But the investigators said they talked with a supervisor after finding that verification steps weren't recorded for certain lots of the painkiller.
``A few minutes later,'' the report states, ``the supervisor was seen entering the tablet manufacturing room where {another lot} was being processed, and initialed the batch record without actually verifying the weights.''
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lilly</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment about individual incidents in the report, its response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>'s inspection says its training program will ``reinforce'' its policy that employees ``initial only those steps or actions that they perform, verify or observe.''
The three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> investigators spent four months examining the manufacturing and control systems of the plant. The 90-page report, which is unusually long for such investigations, details problems the investigators said they found ``in nearly every area inspected.
