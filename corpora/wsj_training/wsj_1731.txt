After slipping on news of a smaller-than-expected U.S. inflation figure, the dollar rebounded later in the trading day.
The U.S. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> consumer price index. The report showed that September consumer prices rose just 0.2%, a smaller increase than expected. The market had anticipated a 0.4% rise in the price index.
The September index fueled speculation, damaging to the dollar, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> soon will ease monetary policy further.
But foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar staged a quick comeback, prompted by a round of short covering and some fresh buying interest later in the trading day.
Traders said that a nearly 40-point gain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average, fueled in part by news of a lower-than-expected price index, had little influence on the dollar's moves.
``The market is beginning to disassociate itself from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>,'' said one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trader.
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 marks, down from 1.8485 marks late Wednesday, and at 141.70 yen, up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was quoted at $1.5990, up from $1.5920 late Wednesday.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Friday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency opened for trading at 141.93 yen, up from Thursday's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> close of 141.55 yen.
Some analysts said the consumer price index reflects a more significant slowdown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy than earlier indicated. They point out that September's producer-price index showed a 0.9% increase.
They noted that because the consumer price index, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CPI</ENAMEX>, is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index, or PPI, it could signal further easing by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
Others suggested, however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> will hold any changes in monetary policy in check, leaving fed funds at around 8 3/4%, down from the 9% level that prevailed from July through September.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Logan</ENAMEX>, chief economist with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Bank Corp.</ENAMEX>, said that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPI</ENAMEX> climbed around 4 1/2% year-to-year in September. He argued that both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPI</ENAMEX> have in fact decelerated since spring.
``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> won't be stampeded into easing,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan</ENAMEX> said, predicting that for now, interest rates will stay where they are.
A four-day matched sale-purchase agreement, a move to drain liquidity from the system, was viewed as a technical move, rather than an indication of tightening credit.
Market participants note that the mark continues to post heftier gains against its U.S. counterpart than any other major currency, particularly the yen.
``There's a bottomless pit of dollar demand'' by Japanese investors, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Beale</ENAMEX>, managing director of foreign exchange at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, adding that purely speculative demand wouldn't hold the dollar at its recent levels against the Japanese currency.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beale</ENAMEX> commented that the mark remains well bid against other currencies as well.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert White</ENAMEX>, manager of corporate trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Interstate of California</ENAMEX>, called the market ``psychologically pro-mark,'' noting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> remains a ``veritable grab bag'' for Japanese investors which accounts for the unabated demand for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollars.
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, gold dropped $1.60 to $367.10 an ounce in moderate trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.
In early trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> Friday, gold was at about $366.85 an ounce.
