A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big, untapped fields in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mackenzie River</ENAMEX> delta area of the western <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Arctic</ENAMEX>.
Three companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esso Resources Canada Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell Canada Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.</ENAMEX>, applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian National Energy Board</ENAMEX> to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mackenzie</ENAMEX> delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996.
To be economically feasible, the 11 billion Canadian dollar (US$9.37 billion) project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices. It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas.
The board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that Canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mackenzie</ENAMEX> delta gas on terms similar to those offered to U.S. customers.
U.S. buyers have already been lined up. They include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enron Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Eastern Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Interstate Transmission Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.</ENAMEX>
The project could result in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> taking more than 10% of its natural gas supplies from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, up from about 5% currently. It would bring 13 gas fields into production at a combined rate of about 1.2 billion cubic feet a day.
The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mackenzie</ENAMEX> delta to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alberta</ENAMEX> would be about C$5.9 million. It also said projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of C$5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Esso</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial Oil Ltd.</ENAMEX> which is 71%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX>, will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the U.S. in the 20-year period. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Dutch/Shell Group</ENAMEX>, will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX> will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet.
