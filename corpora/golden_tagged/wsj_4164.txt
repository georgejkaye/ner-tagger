It's hard being an institution.
Just ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Yankelovich</ENAMEX>, whose last name has been synonymous with market research since 1958, when he founded one of the pioneer market-research firms.
Federal Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Keenan</ENAMEX> has ruled that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yankelovich</ENAMEX> can no longer name market-research services after himself. The judge found that, as far as trade names go, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yankelovich</ENAMEX> belongs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based advertising giant. In 1984, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankelovich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skelly & White Inc.</ENAMEX>, which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yankelovich</ENAMEX> helped found.
``A good name is better than great riches,'' the judge said in his opinion, quoting from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cervantes</ENAMEX>' ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Quixote</ENAMEX>.'' But his ruling was based on a federal appeals court decision that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taylor</ENAMEX> wine family couldn't use the family name to promote wines after selling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taylor Wine Co.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola Co.</ENAMEX>
``As both parties are acutely aware,'' the judge said, ``in the competitive field of marketing research, a good name is critical to prosperity.'' He granted a preliminary injunction preventing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yankelovich</ENAMEX> from using the name without a prominent disclaimer and ordered a hearing to determine the appropriate disclaimer.
The conflict arose in 1987, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yankelovich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur White</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Florence</ENAMEX> Skelly formed a new company: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White, Yankelovich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skelly Consulting Group Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> sued, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yankelovich</ENAMEX>'s company changed its name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSY Consulting Group Inc.</ENAMEX> -- but it continued to offer market-research products with names like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankelovich Environmental Scan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankelovich</ENAMEX> Attribute Demand Model.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yankelovich</ENAMEX> contended he had the right to the unrestricted use of his name if it didn't confuse customers. But Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> said the court record included a ``litany of actual confusion.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yankelovich</ENAMEX> said he won't comment until he sees the judge's opinion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip H. Schaeffer</ENAMEX>, an attorney for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> unit, also argued that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yankelovich</ENAMEX>'s use of his name could damage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s reputation. ``He was using the name for products that our client believes were inferior,'' the lawyer said.
But Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keenan</ENAMEX> disputed that idea. There was no evidence to suggest ``an appreciable difference in the quality of services offered by the parties,'' he ruled.
