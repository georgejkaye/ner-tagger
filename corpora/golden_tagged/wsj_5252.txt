<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daihatsu</ENAMEX> has agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of money and has agreed to refrain from using imagery from the ``Rocky'' movie series in its marketing of the four-wheel drive sport utility vehicle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGM/UA</ENAMEX> owns the ``Rocky'' motion pictures, starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sylvester Stalone</ENAMEX>. Neither company would disclose further details of the settlement.
