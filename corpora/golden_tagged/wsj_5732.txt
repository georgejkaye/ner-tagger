<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> said third-quarter revenue and earnings would be below expectations because of weakness in the domestic market and in its sales to other computer companies that resell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX> systems.
The supplier of fault-tolerant computer systems for on-line transaction processing said it expects third-quarter net income of 35 cents to 38 cents a share on revenue of about $82 million, compared with earnings of 37 cents a share on revenue of $68.9 million a year earlier.
``We do not see enough business developing during these last two weeks of the quarter to allow us to achieve our original revenue target,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Foster</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer of the company, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus</ENAMEX> had previously projected revenue of $88 million for the quarter. ``We are going to manage the company at the 20% to 25% growth level for the near term, unless we see signs of improvement in these market channels,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foster</ENAMEX> said.
