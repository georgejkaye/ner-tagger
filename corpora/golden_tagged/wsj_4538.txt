<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron Ltee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s second largest cable-television concern, has taken a powerful and unlikely partner for its move into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX> cable market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE Inc.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> will acquire a 23% stake in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Videotron Corp.</ENAMEX> British cable subsidiary. Terms weren't disclosed. The companies said the transaction is subject to approval of the U.K. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable Authority</ENAMEX>. After the transaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron</ENAMEX> will hold 61%, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> 23% and European investors, who weren't identified, 16% of the unit, formerly known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southhampton Cable Ltd.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> telecommunications, financial-services, energy, printing and real-estate concern. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Canada</ENAMEX> unit is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s largest telephone company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> cable-television concern.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> said it expects its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Videotron Corp.</ENAMEX> could increase to about 30% during the next three years and amount to about # 30 million ($48.6 million). The companies said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> will have the right to name two of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Videotron Corp.</ENAMEX>'s nine directors and will provide a senior-management representative to assist the company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Videotron Corp.</ENAMEX> has four cable franchises in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> -- one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southhampton</ENAMEX> and three in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> area -- and has applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable Authority</ENAMEX> for two more franchises. All told, the franchises, or territories, include 1.1 million households.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Canada</ENAMEX> unit are going head-to-head in the videotext market. This month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron</ENAMEX> launched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Videoway</ENAMEX>, an add-on to its cable service that will deliver various information and other services to cable subscribers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Canada</ENAMEX> applied to Canadian regulatory authorities for permission to introduce its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alex</ENAMEX> videotext service nationally, which delivers similar information services over telephone lines.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron</ENAMEX> spokesman denied the companies are competitors in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s videotext market, saying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Videoway</ENAMEX> is a ``mass-market'' system that includes a standard cable converter, games and information services with broad appeal while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alex ``</ENAMEX>is more for somebody already familiar with computers.''
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> spokesman said the investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron</ENAMEX>'s British subsidiary doesn't indicate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE</ENAMEX> is considering other cable investments, including buying a stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Groupe Videotron</ENAMEX> itself.
