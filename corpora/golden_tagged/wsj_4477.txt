<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television</ENAMEX> viewers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> earlier this month might have thought they were seeing double.
There was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Roland</ENAMEX> at his usual perch anchoring the ``10 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Clock News</ENAMEX>'' on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WNYW</ENAMEX>-TV, a station owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox Broadcasting</ENAMEX> unit. But upon switching to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Headline News</ENAMEX> on cable, viewers would have seen him on videotape anchoring a five-minute summary of regional news.
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland</ENAMEX>'s double duty shows, two longtime nemeses, cable systems and over-the-air broadcasters, are turning increasingly to cooperation. The two sides have been at odds for years over a broad range of competitive and regulatory issues, but they are finding that some broadcast-and-cable alliances, especially in news operations, make sense.
``If broadcasters can't beat cable operators, which they can not, the alternative is to join with them in joint ventures and revenue-sharing schemes,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Gerbrandt</ENAMEX>, a vice president and senior analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paul Kagan Associates Inc.</ENAMEX>, a media research firm.
Some broadcasters and analysts are uneasy about the alliances. ``We're entering the era of the blur,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Gottesman</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. As to whether a broadcast station might lose some viewers to a cable channel that is running programming supplied by that same broadcast station, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gottesman</ENAMEX> says, ``There is always that chance, but it's also like betting on two horses in the same race.''
Many news officials say the possible gains outweigh the potential drawbacks. ``It's a risk worth taking,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Duke</ENAMEX>, news director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Orleans</ENAMEX> affiliate, which is about to start a one-year trial of a news channel on a local cable system. ``People are going over to cable anyway,'' he says, ``so why not see our product there as well?''
Partnerships are forming in news rather than entertainment because a news story is easier for two programmers to share than a hit show and because news departments tend to be more aggressive in cutting costs. Networks and independent stations, whose costs for covering news continue to escalate despite staffing cutbacks, can share those expenses with cable operators.
For cable operators, which reach about 51 million homes, or about 56% of all television households, the partnerships provide ``the programming knowledge that broadcasters have,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerbrandt</ENAMEX> says. ``Cable operators are still uncomfortable with the notion of being programmers.'' Many cable owners also use the news broadcasts to help fill excess channel capacity.
One partnership aims to use cable to reach large local-news markets neglected by broadcast stations. The venture was formed last year by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> Cable, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cablevision Systems Corp.</ENAMEX>, a large cable operator based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Woodbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX> It already operates News 12 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, a round-the-clock local news channel that reaches 575,000 homes.
News 12's annual operating budget is about $9 million, paltry when compared with network-owned stations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, which have news budgets approaching $40 million. But News 12, started by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cablevision</ENAMEX> in 1986, attracts viewers: About 60% of the potential audience tunes in at least once a day, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Fine</ENAMEX>, news director.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> was a perfect market for a local news service because it is underserved by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> television stations,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Wolzein</ENAMEX>, senior vice president for regional news at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> Cable. ``We're wrestling with the question of whether there are other places in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> where there is a concentration of cable subscribers who are underserved by the local news currently available to them.'' The partnership is now looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orange County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, and suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, among other markets.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> currently provides only funding to the joint venture in return for a share of profits, though officials of both companies have indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> or local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> affiliates might share their resources with regional cable networks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX> also are considering cable news alliances. Earlier this month, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio-Television News Directors Association</ENAMEX> convention in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>, officials from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> said they were looking into establishing local and regional cable newscasts in cooperation with network affiliates. Both networks emphasize that their talks are in the exploratory stages and won't give details. ``I've only spoken with two affiliates,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Frazee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>'s vice president of news services. ``I haven't even spoken to management about this yet.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Headline News</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fox</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WNYW</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> hope their 13-week experimental alliance will give each a promotional boost. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland</ENAMEX>'s news segments, which run every half-hour on the Turner channel from 5:55 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> Cable subscribers, give WNYW exposure among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Headline News</ENAMEX> viewers. The cable channel, in turn, can attract <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> viewers by advertising the local tie-in in area publications.
``We expect about 35 stations nationwide to take part in this experiment by the end of the year,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Petrovich</ENAMEX>, executive vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Headline News</ENAMEX>. So far, he adds, 20 have signed up.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WNYW</ENAMEX>'s station manager, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Temple</ENAMEX>, says, ``We look at it as a promotional opportunity and a service to viewers who want a quick shot of local news at a part of the day when no one is providing it.''
Some local stations are taking the concept even further. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WCVB</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> station that has won many awards for its news operation, is exploring the possibility of a 24-hour local cable operation, though officials won't give details. In a one-year experiment scheduled to start Monday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWL</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Orleans</ENAMEX> will have a news channel on a local cable system owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Enterprises Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Cable Communications</ENAMEX> subsidiary. The channel will run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWL</ENAMEX>'s four daily newscasts live, at the same time that the station broadcasts them; between the live news shows, the cable channel will repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWL</ENAMEX>'s latest newscast.
``In this day and age, viewers zap through channels so much,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWL</ENAMEX>'s news director. ``We want to pop up in the zapping process twice. Having our newscasts on cable also allows us to expose our product to viewers around the clock.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWL</ENAMEX>'s owner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loyola University</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox</ENAMEX> will share costs and profits for the cable news operation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Network Enterprises</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom International Inc.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conus Communications</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hubbard Broadcasting Inc.</ENAMEX>, plan to start a 24-hour news service in November that could eventually team cable systems with local broadcast stations across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Viacom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conus</ENAMEX>, which operates a service that pools local news footage from about 100 TV stations nationwide, will try to sell its satellite feed to home satellite-dish owners, starting in November. The companies say they also expect local cable systems to start buying the feed, which they could simply run as a round-the-clock channel or package into periodic newscasts.
``It's a format that could easily repeat itself with updates every half-hour,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Bernard</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Network Enterprises.</ENAMEX> ``It's going to be like all-news radio.''
