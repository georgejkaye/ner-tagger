Earlier this year, when Israeli Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yitzhak Shamir</ENAMEX> unveiled his proposal for Palestinian elections in the occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza Strip</ENAMEX>, some Israelis likened the event to an elephant sticking its trunk through the eye of a needle. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> had taken the first step toward peace, but to get him all the way from his proposal to the negotiating table still would take a lot of pulling.
Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX>'s President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosni Mubarak</ENAMEX> has grabbed the trunk and given it a powerful tug. In an unusually bold move for the cautious Egyptian leader, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX> has stepped forward as a would-be go-between for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israelis</ENAMEX> by offering a 10-point elaboration of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX>'s election proposal that attempts to make it acceptable to Palestinians without altering its basic thrust.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX>'s move signals the unease of moderate Arabs over the lack of progress toward peace since Yasser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX>, the chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine Liberation Organization</ENAMEX>, renounced terrorism and recognized <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> last December. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX>'s lack of political gain in return for his concessions has left him exposed to criticism from Palestinian radicals, with the risk that his position will be undermined or that he will, to save his job, revert to a hardline stance.
Signs that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> moderates are losing control also are apparent in the occupied territories, where the violence of the 21-month uprising has turned inward. In recent months, Palestinians have murdered alleged collaborators and, in apparent actions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic fundamentalists</ENAMEX>, those Palestinians thought to be engaged in immoral activities.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX>'s 10 points aren't at odds with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX>'s plan as it was approved by the Israeli Knesset, or parliament, in March. But since then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Party</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Likud Party</ENAMEX> have come to interpret the plan quite differently.
While there is a gulf between the Egyptian position and that of Likud on several key issues, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX>'s points are in line with the interpretation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor Party</ENAMEX>, which holds 39 seats to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Likud</ENAMEX>'s 40 seats in the 120-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knesset</ENAMEX>, and governs with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Likud</ENAMEX> in a coalition.
The Israeli defense minister, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor's</ENAMEX> Yitzhak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabin</ENAMEX>, flew to Cairo yesterday for a meeting with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX> to discuss the 10 points. After the session, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabin</ENAMEX> said he strongly supported <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX>'s role.
The 10 points are: an open campaign; immunity for those elected; withdrawal of Israeli troops from polling stations on election day; presence of foreign observers; a one-day ban on Israelis entering the territories; Israeli commitment to accept the election's results; setting a date for the beginning of negotiations on the final status of the occupied lands; participation of voters in Arab <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Jerusalem</ENAMEX>, and a freeze on Jewish settlements. The 10th point calls on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> to ``accept the four principles of the American policy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> {including}... trading land for peace.''
The wording of the final point almost compels U.S. support and puts the Bush administration in a ticklish spot. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Likud</ENAMEX>, especially its right wing, finds many of the points unacceptable, particularly any talk of land for peace.
The Bush administration has been unwilling to push the Israeli government. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimon Peres</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> more than ever at odds, the risk of the government crumbling is ever-present.
Yet for the U.S. to be less than wholehearted in its support for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX>, who is soon due in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, would be inconsistent with its own proclaimed Middle East policies.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX> wants to host a Cairo meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israelis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palestinians</ENAMEX> to discuss election arrangements. On the face of it, this is what Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> has long wanted: direct negotiations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palestinians</ENAMEX> without pressure from an array of hostile parties such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, who would have been present at any international peace conference.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptians</ENAMEX> have proposed that the Palestinian delegation be made up of residents of the occupied territories plus Palestinians deported from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>. This gets around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX>'s insistence that the fate of the territories concerns the 2.5 million Palestinians who don't now live there, as well as the 1.5 million who do. Yet it spares Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> from talking directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> officials, which he has sworn never to do.
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> is unlikely to give as much ground as the Egyptians want, he can't afford to dismiss the initiative out of hand because he would risk fracturing the fragile coalition government and probably sparking further U.S. disapprobation. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> probably will search for some maneuvering room in the proposal and use the frenetic shuttle diplomacy it engenders to buy himself time.
