A power struggle with political overtones has broken out for control of one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s private television stations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX>.
Currently before French courts, the struggle involves a fight between right-wing press baron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Hersant</ENAMEX> and pro-Socialist businessman  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerome Seydoux</ENAMEX> for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX>'s board. Both are shareholders, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> is chairman.
Founded in late 1985 as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s deregulation of the broadcast industry, the station originally was controlled by two investors chosen by the then-Socialist government, Italian media baron <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silvio Berlusconi</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seydoux</ENAMEX>.
A conservative government took power in 1986 and renounced that arrangement, calling it a privately arranged, uncompetitive deal. It held a competition and awarded control to a group led by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX>, which also happened to include Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seydoux</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berlusconi</ENAMEX>.
Now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialists</ENAMEX> are back in power, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seydoux</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlusconi</ENAMEX> have mounted a palace coup, aimed at replacing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> with a yet-unnamed person of their choosing. To no one's surprise, government communications authorities have authorized the switch.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hersant</ENAMEX> has taken the matter to court, arguing that a proposed purchase of shares by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seydoux</ENAMEX> from another investor violates rights of first refusal held by all shareholders. The investor in question, an agricultural cooperative, denies that it has sold the shares or violated the agreement.
A spokeswoman for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seydoux</ENAMEX> denies that the fight is political. She says Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seydoux</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berlusconi</ENAMEX> have criticized the channel for losing hundreds of millions of francs. The French government also has penalized it for failing to observe government regulations requiring that a high percentage of programs be made locally.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX> won't disclose its losses, which it says it regards as an investment. And a spokeswoman said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX> expects the losses to end by mid-1990, which it considers normal for such a new station. She said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">La Cinq</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s third-largest station, with a 15% audience share.
