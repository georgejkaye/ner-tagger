<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heck's Inc.</ENAMEX> said it emerged from federal bankruptcy-law protection and changed the name of its stores to Take 10 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discount Club</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heck's</ENAMEX>, which operates 55 discount stores, also said its stock began trading over-the-counter today under the symbol <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HEXX</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heck's</ENAMEX> will continue to be traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
The company said the new name of its stores reflects the marketing strategy of offering 10% off all products. So far, about half the stores have begun the so-called Take 10 discount program.
Two years ago Heck's filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, under which a company continues to operate, shielded from creditor suits, as it devises a debt-payment plan. Since then, Heck's has undergone a major restructuring.
