<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing ``circuit breakers'' to halt program trading at volatile times.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>, in his first testimony to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> since taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> post, said the agency is studying the Friday the 13th market plunge, including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following Monday. After the study, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine-tuning the current ones, he added.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit breakers</ENAMEX>, designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements, curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points. At certain points during the Friday the 13th drop, circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market, slowing trading at times. A circuit breaker that would have closed down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> wasn't tripped.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Markey</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</ENAMEX>, is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb ``turmoil'' in the marketplace. He argued that program-trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> didn't reject the proposal. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> study of the drop is completed, he said, ``I'm perfectly happy to work with this committee... in identifying whether we need other devices,'' such as a program-trading curb.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX>. The measure is expected to move through this Congress. But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> contended that uncertainty over when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> might act could worsen volatility in the markets. He argued that the current circuit-breaker system allows investors to know ``precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill. One would force brokerage houses to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> detailed information about loans made by their holding companies. Such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs, and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms.
He also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a systematic basis. That information, he argued, is critical to reconstructing sharp market moves, such as the one nearly two weeks ago.
