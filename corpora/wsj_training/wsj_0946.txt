Legal controversies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case. They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment.
It has always been so. In the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T. Scopes</ENAMEX>, volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Civil Liberties Union</ENAMEX> to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee Legislature</ENAMEX>. The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the ``smart set,'' whose spokesman was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H.L. Mencken</ENAMEX>, and the religious fundamentalists, whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mencken</ENAMEX> derided as benighted primitives. Few now recall the actual outcome: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scopes</ENAMEX> was convicted and fined $100, and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX> law.
So it was with the Hiss case a generation later, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alger</ENAMEX> Hiss became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the Cold War and conflicting attitudes toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Deal</ENAMEX> he had served. His trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets he allegedly had passed to Soviet intelligence.
And so it seems to be with the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Morgan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> has just emerged from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> jail after more than two years' confinement for contempt of court, a heroine to her many supporters.
To the rest of us, the case is a puzzle. It is what lawyers call ``fact intensive.'' It presents no great issue of legal principle, no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt. Instead, it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of ``who did what to whom.'' It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy. Certainly I do not.
So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many, not just in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> but elsewhere in the country and even the world. I suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX>.
The first is that it represents an intense battle in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Thurber</ENAMEX> used to caricature as ``the war between the sexes.'' But although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX> did so gently and lightheartedly, many of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX>'s supporters have taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX>'s memorable title ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Male</ENAMEX> Animal'' quite literally. The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurber</ENAMEX> accepted as an eternal part of the human condition.
A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> case. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the ``best'' schools. As members of the Black Caucus in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX>, does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated, black, working-class woman, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her? Or that the president would have hurried to sign the bill ``out of compassion for her plight''? To ask those questions is to answer them.
Finally, the case of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbia</ENAMEX> government. The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons, and congressmen read the  same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the area do. Bashing the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> government is risk-free for members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is paralyzed from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit. Yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed Congress with almost unimaginable speed, before the judicial process had run its course, and, indeed, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX> case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgan</ENAMEX>'s particular situation. It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence.
