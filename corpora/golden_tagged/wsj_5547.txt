Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks generally marked time along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> issues, continuing what traders are characterizing as a consolidation phase.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite Index improved 0.16 to 467.05 on 136.7 million shares. So far, September's average daily turnover is about 131 million shares. That's about in line with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX>'s average daily volume of 132.8 million shares for the year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX>'s biggest issues didn't move much. The Nasdaq 100 Index of non-financial stocks added 0.37 to 443.87. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Index</ENAMEX> eased 0.25 to 463.86.
``Absolutely directionless,'' is how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. Cuyler Kline</ENAMEX>, managing director of OTC trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robinson-Humphrey</ENAMEX>, described the OTC market. ``I think {there's} a lack of conviction on the part of buyers,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kline</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kline</ENAMEX> observed that OTC-market investors seem to be as indecisive as their counterparts in the listed market. Yesterday, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> industrials and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite were practically unchanged. ``This directionlessness is indicative of a consolidation,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kline</ENAMEX> said. He figures that, after recently setting new highs, both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> probably need a breather before ``assaulting'' those new records.
Several individual stocks moved sharply.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xoma</ENAMEX> dropped 2 to 20 1/2 on 809,300 shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kupor</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Professional Investor Report that the biotechnology concern's clinical data on its treatment for septic shock, as presented to a conference Monday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>, seemed of ``borderline quality.'' He said the data ``had insufficient statistical power to convince an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> panel'' that the product is ``worth approving within the time frame anticipated.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kupor</ENAMEX> and other analysts have been expecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> approval for the septic shock treatment in mid-1990, the news service said. But, the approval could now be delayed six months, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kupor</ENAMEX> told Professional Investor Report. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kupor</ENAMEX> hasn't lowered his rating on the company, which he calls a ``moderately weak hold,'' the news service said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Mendell</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berkeley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, company, said he believes the scientific results were ``well received'' by the physicians and analysts at the conference. He also downplayed the impact of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kupor</ENAMEX>'s comments, saying that profit-taking probably accounted for some of the decline in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xoma</ENAMEX>'s share price yesterday.
On 2.7 million shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantera</ENAMEX>'s tumbled 1 1/2 to 3/8. The franchise restaurant operator said its secured lenders have terminated the waiver they previously gave the company and have declared the entire $35.5 million owed them immediately due and payable. The lenders have frozen the company's operating accounts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pantera</ENAMEX>'s said.
The company also said its ability to continue operations outside of bankruptcy-proceedings is significantly impaired and a filing under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code is imminent. A Chapter 11 filing allows a company to continue operating with protection from creditor lawsuits while it formulates a plan to pay its debts.
Grist Mill fell 24%, or 3 1/4, to 10 1/8 after analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin R. Young</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John G. Kinnard & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> cut his near-term rating on the stock and lowered first-quarter earnings estimates for the cereals and snacks maker, Professional Investor Report said. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> told the news service he lowered his near-term rating on Grist Mill to ``hold'' from ``buy,'' but is maintaining his long-term ``accumulate'' recommendation.
The analyst said he lowered his earnings estimate for the fiscal first quarter ended last month to 14 cents a share from 22 cents a share, after company officials told him estimates for certain expenses would be higher than expected. Grist Mill earned 14 cents a share in the year-earlier period.
After being halted for three full sessions, trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> shares resumed. The stock closed at 11 7/8, up 1 1/8 from last Wednesday when activity was suspended for a series of news announcements. Yesterday, before trading resumed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> as well as on Nasdaq, the retailing conglomerate said it entered definitive agreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments</ENAMEX> and received a portion of a $250 million secured loan from the real estate giant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> also said the loan will enable it to meet all obligations to suppliers and creditors of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied Stores</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Stores</ENAMEX> units.
As part of the pact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Olympia</ENAMEX>'s fully diluted stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> will increase to 38.4% from 25% and the fully diluted stake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX>, will drop to 43.2% from 54%.
Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micron Technology</ENAMEX> slipped 1/4 to 13 7/8 after the maker of computer memory chips reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter, ended Aug. 31, of 42 cents a share. A year earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micron</ENAMEX> earned $1.27 a share. Analysts' estimates for the quarter ranged from 40 cents a share to 90 cents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccormick</ENAMEX> added 1/8 to 42 1/8. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hunt Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>, distributor of spices, flavorings and tea said its board authorized the repurchase of as much as 5%, or about 1.1 million shares, of the company's 20.8 million common shares outstanding.
Separately, the company announced operating earnings of 78 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with operating earnings of 47 cents a share a year before. Estimates from analysts were between 45 cents a share and 65 cents a share.
Among the OTC's most active stocks, the American depositary receipts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguar</ENAMEX> gained 1 11/32 to 7 13/16. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford Motor</ENAMEX> said it is seeking an unspecified stake in the British auto maker.
Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acclaim Entertainment</ENAMEX>, which completed a secondary offering of 1.7 million shares, advanced 3/8 to 7.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications</ENAMEX> rose 1 1/4 to 44 7/8.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corestates Financial</ENAMEX>, which agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> for $18.75 a share, or about $730 million, lost 3/4 to 46 3/4.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratus Computer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems</ENAMEX> also were lower.
