<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thou</ENAMEX> shalt not leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> Burnham?
That seems to be the message at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.</ENAMEX>, which is completing a wrenching restructuring spurred by its settlement in the insider-trading scandal. Now closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has proposed a bylaws change that effectively discourages defections by employees holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> stock.
Under the proposed bylaws change, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> hasn't publicly announced, shareholders who leave the firm will have to wait significantly longer to cash in their stock than they currently do. In fact, says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> official, the average length of the payout period in which departing shareholders get paid for all of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> holdings will jump to 5.5 years under the new plan, from the current 1.4 years. The wait will increase particularly for those with more than $100,000 invested.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> is one of the two largest closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> securities firms; the other is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX> At such concerns, the equity that employee shareholders have in the firm is an important part of both the company's financial strength and an indicator of employee morale.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Eckenfelder</ENAMEX>, a securities industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, said even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> employees generally have been happy, management could be concerned that ``if a bunch of people would depart the firm, it'd put more pressure on their equity base than in years past.'' He said the payout change, if approved, will probably help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> retain employees.
About 1,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> employees have purchased and own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> shares; others own shares through the firm's employee-bonus plan. In all, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> workers have some $1.1 billion invested in the firm, representing a significant portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s $1.9 billion in year-end 1988 capital, according to its latest annual report.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> insists its shareholder-payout changes aren't spurred by any concerns about its capital base or disgruntled shareholders.
Indeed, until now, few important employees have quit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, despite two years of government civil and criminal investigations of the firm and its employees that culminated this month in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s guilty plea to six felony counts. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> has nonetheless shed about 40% of its staff during its past six months' of restructuring, which included the sale of its brokerage network for individual investors.
Some employees say there is a fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> would be vulnerable if there were defections from several of the large remaining shareholders, such as those snubbed by certain management changes. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> spokesman said the firm has no such worries.
Instead, said the spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> is merely changing to a ``more conventional'' from a ``liberal'' way of structuring payouts to departing shareholders, ``in line with what other {closely held} firms are doing.'' This year was the right time for the change because of all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s other restructuring, the spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>'s 5,500 workers -- down from about 9,200 in April and 10,300 before the insider-trading inquiry -- will vote on the payout change at a special meeting Friday.
Under the current and proposed payout schedules, employees who quit receive 30% of the value of their shares after 90 days. But while under the current system, employees get fully 90% of their total payout after 18 months, under the new plan they must wait several years after the initial 30% payment. They would get the other 70% in a 10%-a-year trickle in each of years four through 10.
There are several exceptions to the new plan; for example, employees with less than $50,000 invested in the firm get everything back within 60 days under both the current and proposed payout plans.
So why would the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> holders vote yes? Among other things, say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> officials, the bylaws change promises a newly instituted dividend plan tied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> earnings. Also, they argue that until the final payout, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> employees should get a good return on their money.
Already deducted from the $1.1 billion shareholders' equity figure, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, is the stake of indicted former junk-bond chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Milken</ENAMEX>, as well as about $61 million paid this year to other employees who left the firm as the result of the sale of its retail-brokerage network and the severe shrinking of other operations such as municipal finance, municipal-bond trading and over-the-counter stocks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> considers the payout bylaws change as the final piece in all of this year's restructuring. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX>, there are no plans for any additional large-scale staff cuts.
