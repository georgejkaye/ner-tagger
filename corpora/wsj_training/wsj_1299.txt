Some House Democrats are trying to head off an appointment by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout, contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself.
Four Democrats on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Banking Committee</ENAMEX> sent President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Simmons</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oversight Board</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oversight Board</ENAMEX>, created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August, sets policy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX>, which will sell hundreds of the nation's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets. Treasury Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kemp</ENAMEX> are members of the board. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> must appoint two other members, one a Democrat and one a Republican.
An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX>, the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley National Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, is the Republican appointee, and that a security clearance was under way. The Democratic appointee hasn't been determined, the official said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> declined to comment, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said the congressmen's letter is under review.
The letter, dated last Thursday, cited the losses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley National</ENAMEX>, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Bank</ENAMEX>, also of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX>, where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> was chairman for 29 years. Both banks have been battered, as have other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> banks, by falling real estate prices. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley National</ENAMEX>, for example, had $470 million in problem assets as of June.
``We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> appointment,'' the letter said. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> needs the most able, competent management available.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> has long ties to both Republicans and banking. He was co-chairman of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s Arizona campaign committee in last year's election, and also worked for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in the 1980 election. The two met more than 30 years ago, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Bank & Trust Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, where Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was an organizing director.
In 1986, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> also served on a committee of businessmen headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Seidman</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> That committee determined to open Arizona to banking across state lines. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> Trend magazine referred to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simmons</ENAMEX> this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state.
The letter to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was signed by Reps. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Vento</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minn.</ENAMEX>), the chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banking Committee</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTC</ENAMEX> Task Force, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Mcmillen</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kweisi Mfume</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kanjorski</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>).
