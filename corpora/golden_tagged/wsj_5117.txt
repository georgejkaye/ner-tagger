<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX> bought itself some extra time to resolve its financial difficulties, with a plan to raise about # 100 million (US$158 million) by selling businesses.
The sales plan, announced yesterday, helped pacify the company's bankers, who agreed to a short-term extension of the company's credit lines. As a result of the bank agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s third-largest defense-electronics concern said it ``will continue to trade normally.''
The announcement, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> analysts said, appears to give Ferranti extra time to arrange a merger, partnership, or other means of repairing its tattered balance sheet. Serious accounting irregularities -- which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> has said may be due to fraud -- were disclosed Sept. 11 in the books of a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lancaster</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Signal & Control Group PLC</ENAMEX>, with which it merged last year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> has said the unit reported inflated asset and profit figures. The expected correction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s books may slash its net worth, or assets minus liabilities, as much as # 200 million, or about half the # 370.8 million net worth reported March 31.
Disclosure of the problem rocked the company and unnerved its bankers and customers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurofighter S.A</ENAMEX>, a European consortium collaborating on construction of a fighter-jet, recently warned its suppliers to exercise ``caution'' when subcontracting to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>. The company's bankers, meanwhile, were legally entitled to call in Ferranti loans, because of the drop in net worth, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
``The company was in breach of loan agreements'' because of the accounting problem, he said. Any significant reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s credit lines could have panicked its customers and suppliers, worsening its problems.
The banking agreement averts, at least temporarily, such a calamity. To further reassure Ferranti clients and suppliers, the British defense ministry yesterday gave the company a public vote of confidence. ``Despite its current financial difficulties,'' the ministry said, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> remains an important and valued supplier.'' It added: ``We are continuing to discuss further (defense) requirements with them.''
Yesterday's developments represent ``a good short-term measure'' for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>, said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Stewart</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> spokesmen declined to say how long the new banking agreement is for.
One source involved in the banking talks called the pact ``short-term.'' None of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s banks threatened to call in their loans, this source said -- it would have been against their own interests to have done so. About 30 banks, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baring Bros.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Westminster Bank PLC</ENAMEX>, were involved in the talks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> spokesmen declined to say how much credit the banks agreed to extend, but repeated previous statements that Ferranti credit lines normally total about # 300 million, of which about # 200 million is normally being used at any one time.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s plan to raise cash with # 100 million in asset sales wasn't a condition of the new bank agreement, but it helped appease the bankers. The businesses being offered for sale, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> said, are all ``peripheral to the main electronics activities.'' A spokesman declined to identify the businesses, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> analysts speculated the sales list could include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s small civilian computer-making operation.
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> is already in contact with potential buyers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> spokesman said, arranging the sales ``isn't the sort of thing you can do in a couple of days.''
Arranging a merger or partnership will take even longer. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> said talks with ``a number'' of potential partners are under way, the company's negotiations probably will be delayed by close examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s books. Moreover, at least two other British defense businesses, divisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorn-EMI PLC</ENAMEX> and of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racal Electronics PLC</ENAMEX>, are also on the auction block for unrelated reasons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consequently</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> has to compete for buyers' attention.
The most likely partners, analysts say, include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace PLC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson S.A.</ENAMEX>; spokesmen for those companies declined to comment.
