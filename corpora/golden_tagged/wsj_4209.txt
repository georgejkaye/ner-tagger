``To be Jewish,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia Ozick</ENAMEX> once told a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paris Review interviewer</ENAMEX>, ``is to be a member of a civilization -- a civilization with a long, long history, a history that is, in one way of viewing it, a procession of ideas.'' Few figures in American letters have struggled to swell the ranks of that procession as visibly as have Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX> and her fellow novelist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul Bellow</ENAMEX>. For Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellow</ENAMEX> are not only authors but intellectuals, intensely engaged with weighty social, moral and metaphysical questions.
Both could be justly faulted, however, for being rather too preoccupied with intellectual matters for their own good -- or, to be specific, for the good of their fiction. Their characters almost invariably are highbrows, their narratives habitually crowded with heady abstractions. Both are better at making a reader think than at making him feel; both often appear to be more interested in philosophizing about a story than in bringing it to life. ``I believe unashamedly,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX> has said, ``that writers are the most (maybe the only) interesting people.'' Not infrequently, alas, one has the impression that both writers find only themselves interesting.
Yet both have chosen, in newly published books of fiction, to treat a subject remote from their own experience: the life of a Polish Holocaust survivor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>. In the hands of such cerebral, egotistic, and less-than-diffident writers, this might seem a treacherous topic. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortunately</ENAMEX>, however, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellow</ENAMEX> have approached their momentous common theme with considerable circumspection. As if to reflect this stance, both volumes are exceedingly modest in scale.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX>'s book, ``The Shawl'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knopf</ENAMEX>, 70 pages, $12.95), consists of two related stories that were published in The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> in the early'80s. The first, the taut, harrowing ``The Shawl,'' depicts the incidents leading to the concentration-camp death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa Lublin</ENAMEX>'s baby, whom she has kept hidden in a shawl. In ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa</ENAMEX>'' she appears 30 years later -- solitary, mad and dwelling in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> residential hotel for the elderly. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX> does a splendid job of conveying the hotel's atmosphere: It's less a place to live than a waiting room for death. And indeed, though her niece urges her to forget the past and go on with life, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa</ENAMEX>'s constant refrain is that she doesn't have a life: ``Thieves took it.'' Yet Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX> succeeds stunningly in bringing this tragic, demented woman to life. One reason is that Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ozick</ENAMEX> doesn't render <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa</ENAMEX> as an unimpeachable icon of suffering; on the contrary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa</ENAMEX> is an intellectual snob whose outrage over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Holocaust</ENAMEX> centers largely on the fact that it reduced her delicate, poetry-writing mother and her distinguished bank-director father (``who knew nearly the first half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aeneid</ENAMEX> by heart'') to the level of ``teeming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mockowiczes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rabinowiczes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Perskys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finkelsteins</ENAMEX>, with all their bad-smelling grandfathers and their hordes of feeble children '' Beautiful and harrowing, these stories are a masterly achievement.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellow</ENAMEX>'s ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellarosa</ENAMEX> Connection'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking/Penguin</ENAMEX>, 102 pages, $6.95) is, like ``The Shawl,'' concerned with survival and memory. The narrator heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mnemosyne Institute</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> school for mnemonic techniques. ``Memory is Life,'' he says, and the story he tells concerns his memories of his late friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Fonstein</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fonstein</ENAMEX> was saved from the Holocaust through the capricious long-distance intervention of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Billy Rose</ENAMEX>, the flamboyant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Broadway</ENAMEX> producer, whose name he heard as ``Bellarosa'' and whom, after coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> and making good, he vainly attempted to meet and thank.
A preposterous situation? Yes. And that's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellow</ENAMEX>'s point: How is one to find existence anything but absurd when an impulsive act by a ludicrous show-biz figure can mean the difference between life and death? Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosa</ENAMEX>'s niece, the narrator counsels forgetting: ``First those people murdered you, then they forced you to brood on their crimes.... Forget it. Go <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American.</ENAMEX> Work at your business.'' But Fonstein can not forget.
This story is elegantly shaped and compellingly told. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellow</ENAMEX> shows too little, tells too much. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fonstein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> barely exist except as excuses for him to touch upon pet themes and to pontificate about such things as ``the ground bass of brutality, without which no human music is ever performed.'' Yes, he keeps Rose mostly offstage for a reason: He wants him to remain mythical, as concealed from us as from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fonstein</ENAMEX>. But the effectiveness of all this depends largely on whether the reader is as captivated as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellow</ENAMEX> is by flashy gangsterish types like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX>.
Too much of this book, moreover, strikes one as artificial. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bellow</ENAMEX>'s chief device for underscoring the memory theme -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mnemosyne Institute</ENAMEX> -- never seems anything but a slick contrivance. And the story itself sometimes feels overly schematic, its contours and denouement a bit too glibly reminiscent of previous Bellow fictions, especially ``Seize the Day'' and ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humboldt</ENAMEX>'s Gift.'' Though it is, then, in many ways, a testament to its author's deep intelligence and moral seriousness, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellarosa</ENAMEX> Connection'' ultimately lacks both the passion and the compassion of ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shawl.</ENAMEX>''
