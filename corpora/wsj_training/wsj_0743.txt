The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> challenged an agreement on routes and fares between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s two largest airlines on antitrust grounds.
Meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strasbourg</ENAMEX> Wednesday, the commission voted, as expected, to formally object to the accord between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX>, the state-owned airline, and state-controlled domestic carrier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Inter</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> spokesman said the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX> on how to modify the pact.
At issue is an accord dating back to March in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> gained access to five domestic French routes under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Inter</ENAMEX>'s flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> under the flag of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX>. The two shared results from this route swap, and followed rules on ticket pricing.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC Commission</ENAMEX> decided that such an accord doesn't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law. The airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said, ``we're absolutely ready to study all solutions.'' An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Inter</ENAMEX> spokesman said, ``Because they {the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>} have doubts, we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord.
