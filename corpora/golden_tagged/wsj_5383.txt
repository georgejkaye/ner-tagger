Heavy buying by Japanese investors sent the shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund soaring more than 32%, yesterday's biggest rise for any stock on any exchange.
But analysts and money managers, baffled at the fund's huge run-up in a down market for Spanish shares, cautioned that the publicly traded stock fund is ripe for a fall.
``Invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> and you may go down the drain,'' analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Cress</ENAMEX> wrote in an international strategy weekly publication for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>
Yesterday's closing price of $28.75, up $7, left the closed-end fund trading at an astounding 100% premium over the value of its underlying portfolio of Spanish companies' shares. That's the largest premium of any fund now trading in a market that doesn't restrict direct investment by foreigners. Volume in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund yesterday exceeded 1.1 million shares, 10 times the normal turnover.
(Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that trade publicly at a premium or discount to the market value of their portfolio holdings. Open-end mutual funds continuously issue and redeem shares, always at net asset value.)
Yesterday's run-up stemmed from extraordinarily large orders from Japanese investors executed through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities Co.</ENAMEX>, traders said. Those orders triggered a wave of buying by investors and speculators who were caught in a squeeze because they had earlier bet the stock would fall. Instead, the sharp price rise left them scrambling to cut their losses. That buying, in turn, fueled further price rises.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P.J. Johnson</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX>'s U.S. unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, said: ``As a matter of policy, we never comment on customer transactions.''
Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance Capital Management Corp.</ENAMEX>, the fund's adviser, said ``there are no fundamental developments'' to have caused such a price jump. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Williams</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance's</ENAMEX> chairman, declined to comment on reports of a short squeeze. The market action followed a delayed opening on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> caused by overly large buy orders that couldn't immediately be filled.
For weeks the market has been rife with rumors about massive Japanese interest in the $140 million asset fund. ``The money flows on the retail side have increased enormously in the past two months,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John A. Conlon Jr.</ENAMEX>, an executive vice president at the U.S. unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Securities Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
An executive at one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s big life insurance companies said that the firm had bought the fund, but not in large amounts. Instead, executives at several Japanese securities firms said, the major interest was coming from individual Japanese investors. One added that some traders might mistakenly have interpreted large orders from wealthy customers as institutional purchases. Nonetheless, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conlon</ENAMEX> said, the interest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund was widespread, coming from more than just the Japanese.
Despite the heavy buying, analysts said, investors looking for exposure to Spanish stocks can find much better buys elsewhere. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Iberian Fund</ENAMEX> -- a smaller fund traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> with a portfolio of mostly Spanish securities -- currently trades at about a 22% premium to its net asset value. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Iberian</ENAMEX> rose $1.375, to $12.375, on heavy volume of 565,000 shares.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Spanish Investment Trust</ENAMEX> trades on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> at a slight discount. U.S. investors can also buy American Depositary Receipts on several of the big Spanish stocks in the fund. These so-called Adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Analysts said it's probably worth paying some premium for the professional management of stocks in foreign countries. But only the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX> Fund trades as far above the value of its underlying holdings as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund does now. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX> Fund -- unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund -- invests in a market that is otherwise closed to American and other non-Korean investors.
Moreover, investors buying any fund for more than its portfolio value can easily get hurt. Nearly everything has to go right for investors to make money: Even if the underlying markets surge, the fund's own stock price can fall.
Nonetheless, Japanese investors are seemingly comfortable paying what Americans consider inflated prices for stock. That's because they are used to share prices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> market that average about 65 times company earnings and can sometimes be well over 100 times earnings.
Japanese investors have been buying shares in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West European</ENAMEX> country funds, says an executive at a Japanese securities firm. A key reason: the planned abolition of trade barriers among the 12 countries of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conlon</ENAMEX> noted that many investors consider <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> ``to be at the vanguard'' of the scheduled 1992 European unification. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brokers</ENAMEX> also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>'s specific allure related to the 1992 Olympic games scheduled for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Barcelona</ENAMEX>.
``Everybody wants to put their money into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> because of 1992,'' said a Japanese broker. ``Country funds are the easiest way without having to analyze individual companies.'' He added that country funds are also appealing because their net asset value is clearly evident, even though the stock is trading far above the value of the underlying portfolio.
Japanese investors are also used to investing in so-called themes, such as the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> waterfront. And one broker said that Japanese firms have been pushing the pending 1992 unification of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> as one such theme.
``The Japanese have a lot of money, -- but they're sure not subtle,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Foot</ENAMEX>, managing partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newgate Management Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northampton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, who has sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund short.
