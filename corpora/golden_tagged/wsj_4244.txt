A new congressional report criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX>'s food-safety inspection force for concentrating too much on warehouses and other low-risk enterprises and too little on canneries and other plants that are susceptible to bacterial contamination.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>, the audit arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, said the FDA frequently duplicates the efforts of state regulatory agencies, many of which inspect the same companies four times a year. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> also faulted the agency for not carrying out its policy of concentrating inspections on companies with poor compliance records.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> said more than 62% of the 11,500 U.S. companies inspected in fiscal 1987 were bakeries, bottlers and warehouses, even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> regards seafood processors, infant-formula manufacturers and canned-food plants as posing a greater food-poisoning threat to consumers. Meanwhile, fewer than half of the companies inspected that year had histories of serious violations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> added.
The report was released by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Energy and Commerce Committee</ENAMEX>'s oversight and investigations subcommittee yesterday as lawmakers questioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> officials about shortcomings in the agency's inspection program for imported foods.
The subcommittee staff has found that of the more than one million imported-food shipments in the fiscal year ended September 1987, the short-staffed FDA checked the paperwork on only 9% and tested only 2% for pesticides and other impurities. Of the imports tested, 40% didn't meet FDA standards.
At yesterday's hearing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Schwemer</ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> official, defended the agency's import-screening efforts, saying the 40% violation rate ``indicates our targeting approach is highly effective.'' At the same time, he acknowledged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> has neither the manpower nor the statutory mandate to inspect the roughly 3,400 foreign food-canning plants that are registered with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>. In view of several food-poisoning outbreaks involving canned Chinese mushrooms earlier this year, lawmakers expressed concern about the influx of low-acid canned foods from overseas. ``These foods don't contain enough natural acid or sugar to prevent the growth of microorganisms that can cause illness or death,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Eckart</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>).
He cited recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> estimates that more than 6.5 million Americans become sick and 9,000 die each year from microbial food contamination. Imports make up 9% of food consumed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwemer</ENAMEX> countered that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> officials don't regard low-acid canned food as a major public-health problem. A review of complaints to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> showed no deaths from eating imported canned foods, he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwemer</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> gives much higher priority to inspecting foreign drug makers than to inspecting overseas canneries because improperly formulated drugs have a far greater potential for harm. While swollen and leaking cans are warning signs of possible contamination, he added, ``there's no way for consumers to detect poorly made drugs.
