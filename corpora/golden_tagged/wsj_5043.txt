<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco Pictures Inc.</ENAMEX> said it paid about $500,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noel C. Bloom</ENAMEX> in connection with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX>'s purchase of a company from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX>, who law-enforcement officials have described as a pornographer and associate of organized-crime figures.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> spokesman said the decision to settle the case was influenced by the murder last month of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Menendez</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, a video and audio distributor that is 49% owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX>. The spokesman said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menendez</ENAMEX>'s testimony would have been needed in the case. The spokesman added that he didn't believe there was any connection between the lawsuit and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menendez</ENAMEX>'s murder.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> police are continuing to investigate the murders of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menenendez</ENAMEX> and his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitty</ENAMEX>, in their <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> mansion. No suspects or motives have surfaced in the killings.
The legal dispute between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolco</ENAMEX> revolved around the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Video Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, a distributor of home videos, through a series of transactions beginning in 1986. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> filed suit in 1987 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> state court claiming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Video</ENAMEX> failed to pay him $500,000 due as part of the sale. The companies countersued, claiming -- among other things -- that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> had overstated the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Video</ENAMEX>, which was eventually merged into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Live Entertainment</ENAMEX>.
Last year, a referee agreed upon by both sides awarded Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> $500,000.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Video</ENAMEX> initially appealed. Settlement talks had begun before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Menendez</ENAMEX>'s death, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> spokesman said. By settling, he added, the companies were able to halt accumulating legal fees and interest on the judgment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX>, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed. A 1986 report on organized crime by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> Attorney General described Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> as a ``major distributor of X-rated movies'' and a ``former associate of the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Zaffarano</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonanno</ENAMEX>'' organized-crime family. The report also said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> may have gotten financial help from another figure connected to organized crime.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloom</ENAMEX> has been described by one of his attorneys as a ``reputable'' video distributor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolco</ENAMEX> has also said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Video</ENAMEX> hasn't any involvement with pornography.
