Union leaders want to talk about labor grievances that this month put 250,000 government workers out on strike; environmentalists want to talk about hazardous wastes; English-speakers want to talk about the erosion of their language rights; but all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bourassa</ENAMEX> wants to talk about is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>'s economy.
The deficit is down and foreign investment is up, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>'s premier says. The province is sprouting a native breed of French-speaking entrepreneur for the first time. So, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> repeats his political message: Return his Liberal Party to power in Monday's provincial elections and ``guarantee essential and irreplaceable stability.''
Weary and without enthusiasm, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> voters are about to heed him. But they are doing so with the knowledge that his success in building the province's economy may be making an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> more, not less, plausible.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> denies this, of course, arguing, as he did in a recent interview, that Quebeckers know the economic success he has presided over ``was achieved within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>.'' But the economic acumen and self-confidence that have grown within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> in the past decade and that provide the undergirding for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>'s Liberal campaign have persuaded many Quebeckers that they could make it economically on their own -- especially at a time of free trade with the U.S.
``I used to be afraid of having a separate country, but it doesn't scare me anymore,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcel Dutil</ENAMEX>, who heads <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canam Manac</ENAMEX>, which manufacturers steel girders here. ``I have more confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> and in our competence. We have proven we can run our own show.''
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>'s economic performance has been extraordinarily robust, and Quebeckers like to say their brightest university students are more interested in studying commerce than the classics. Real economic growth here last year outpaced <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s as a whole. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>'s economic outlook is so rosy that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clement Gignac</ENAMEX>, senior economic advisor for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, says flatly, ``We expect no recession.''
More a figure from the counting house than from the bistros of Rue <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Denis</ENAMEX>, the pulsating heart of French street life in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX>, the dour Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> reflects the dispassionate mood of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> today.
From the time he returned to power in 1985 after being repudiated in a landslide that swept <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Levesque</ENAMEX> and the separatist <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX> into office in 1976, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> calculated he could divert attention from the province's other problems -- especially the emotional dispute over language -- by transforming <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> from a debating society into an economic giant.
``More and more,'' he says, ``we are a modern economy.''
Now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> is applying his strategy again. Though his Liberals are expected to deliver another blow to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parti Quebequois</ENAMEX>, whose leader, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Parizeau</ENAMEX>, speaks openly about removing the province from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>'s diversionary tactics are facing their most challenging test.
The premier is both the man at the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> politics and the man in the middle of irresistible and, ultimately, perhaps irreconcilable, forces.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>, 56 years old, has an unusual and uneasy informal coalition with the federal Conservatives, especially Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Mulroney</ENAMEX>, on issues such as free trade with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s proposed Meech Lake constitutional accord, which would acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> is a ``distinct society'' within the nation. But he is squeezed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> nationalists, who say he has capitulated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottawa</ENAMEX>, and traditional federal Liberals, who say he has taken the first steps toward breaking up the country.
``He knows that he can't be too much the federalist or he'll lose the French vote, and he can't be too much the nationalist or he'll lose the English,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Boily</ENAMEX>, a political scientist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX>. ``He knows how to live in between.''
Life in between can often be uncomfortable, however. The other day, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>, who angered English-speaking Quebeckers by reneging on a campaign promise to permit outdoor commercial signs in English, squirmed through an hourlong session designed to reassure these voters -- about a tenth of the electorate -- that he'd protect their interests.
But some of his traditional allies won't leave the issue alone. ``We can find the turnips if the sign is in English or French, but this is a symbolic issue that gets to the question: Are we true Quebeckers in their minds?'' asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Blaikie</ENAMEX>, chairman of Alliance <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>, the largest English-rights lobby in the province.
English voters customarily have sided with the Liberals, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blaikie</ENAMEX> is asking them to look at two small parties running candidates in English-speaking districts or to ``put a big'X' across the paper, spoil the ballot and say:'none of the above.'''
On the other side, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parizeau</ENAMEX>, who was finance minister in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Parti Quebecois</ENAMEX> government, is trying to push the debate even further. The irony is that his party, which watched its own efforts to achieve independence founder in a 1980 referendum, believes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX>'s economic achievements, combined with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Free Trade Agreement</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bourassa</ENAMEX> supported, may bring their goal closer.
``Thank God at last French Canadian entrepreneurship suddenly appeared,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parizeau</ENAMEX>, who argues that with freer trade Quebeckers can just as easily -- and perhaps more happily -- find trading partners in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Dakota</ENAMEX> as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX>. ``We feel far more at ease on the shore of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>. We have more language problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old Orchard Beach</ENAMEX>.''
But the argument of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parizeau</ENAMEX>, 59, reflects a fundamental change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> nationalism as well. The socialism that once was twinned with nationalism has itself withered away and, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andre Bisson</ENAMEX>, the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell Communications Canada</ENAMEX>, puts it, ``this is a new brand of nationalism and it's much less leftist.''
Many analysts today say <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX> is more likely to drift away than fight its way out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s confederation. It may occur less with a bang than with a whimper, reflected more on the balance sheets of corporations than on the map.
``The key is that people are no longer afraid of it,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Pelletier</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorecom</ENAMEX>, the largest public-opinion polling firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>. ``They don't necessarily want it tomorrow morning, but if it comes, it won't be so terrible.
