<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa German Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year, a move that could further consolidate the industry.
Japanese newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nihon Keizai Shimbun</ENAMEX> reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems. They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen ($140 million) in the venture, whose headquarters would be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>.
The action follows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express Corp.</ENAMEX>'s acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Tiger Line Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">August</ENAMEX>. After that, ``it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cotton Daly</ENAMEX>, director of cargo services for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> consulting firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helliesen & Eichner Inc.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Parcel Service of America Inc.</ENAMEX> and other fast-growing air-freight companies. Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures, and there have been rumors about such a tie between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> and European airlines.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> spokesman said he couldn't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report. But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> is talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> about some sort of cargo venture. ``It is just one of a number of strategies <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> after 1992,'' the deadline for ending trade barriers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>, he said.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> spokesman confirmed talks are under way, but declined to comment. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> spokeswoman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> said the head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>'s cargo operations had been in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyko</ENAMEX> last week for talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">JAL</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, Air <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> declined to comment.
``Nothing is defined or signed at this point,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> said of the talks. Whatever accord the three carriers reach, he said, he is skeptical it would create a separate airline.
If the three companies pool their air-freight businesses, their clout would be considerable. According to figures from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Air Transport Association</ENAMEX>, they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flying Tiger</ENAMEX>, as separate companies, carried a combined 2.6 million tons.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities. They plan to increase cooperation in freight ground-handling and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo. Other airlines would have access to the system, they said, and negotiations with partners were already under way.
Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 freighters and 747 Combis, aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck. They currently have large orders for cargo planes.
Several airlines, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cathay Pacific Airways</ENAMEX>, are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daly</ENAMEX> said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> before the end of 1992. Last month, the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> so it could funnel its passengers from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> to other European destinations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> said it hasn't received a proposal from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">JAL</ENAMEX>. But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, a likely first step to any commercial agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX> or another U.K. carrier.
