<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Financial Corp.</ENAMEX>, facing a debt-induced liquidity crunch, said it filed for bankruptcy-court protection.
The filing yesterday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, put an end to three months of tense and frustrating negotiations with lenders to restructure about $1.45 billion in debt.
The action came just as the last two holdouts among 34 senior creditors had shown signs of agreeing to a proposed refinancing plan, according to people close to the talks. ``I think it would be fair to say that the agreement was finally falling into place,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jess Hay</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of the financial services and real estate concern.
But he added that the final settlement wouldn't likely have been reached until the middle of next month, and that by that time the company would find it difficult to make the debt payments originally contemplated by the restructuring plan. ``Throughout the process, time was our mutual enemy, and finally was the factor which produced our decision,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hay</ENAMEX> wrote in a letter to creditors.
In an interview in his office yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hay</ENAMEX> expressed regret about the filing, but predicted the move ultimately will speed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lomas</ENAMEX>'s effort to streamline itself and shed debt. ``Although the senior creditors will be momentarily disrupted, I suppose, there really is no question in my mind that we will emerge in a relatively short period of time from Chapter 11 with a plan that will not only provide 100% {payment} for all creditors but with our equity firmly intact,'' he said. {Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate protected from creditors while working out a plan to pay its debts.}
The bankrupcy filing affects only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Financial</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Realty USA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roosevelt Office Center Inc.</ENAMEX> units, the company said. The company's insurance, mortgage banking and commercial leasing subsidiaries weren't included in the filing; nor were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Advisors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Corporate Services</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Management</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Information Systems</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Administrative Services</ENAMEX>.
The company added that four independent, publicly-held entities bearing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas</ENAMEX> name -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas & Nettleton Mortgage Investors</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Mortgage Securities Fund Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L&N Housing Corp.</ENAMEX> -- won't be affected.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas</ENAMEX>'s problems began in 1987, when its core mortgage-lending business nose-dived.
Liquidity problems mounted earlier this year after federal banking regulators ordered some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas</ENAMEX>'s bank creditors to classify their loans. Although most banks finally agreed to the restructuring, two minor lenders -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First National Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisville</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kentucky</ENAMEX> and a Dutch bank -- refused until recently to go along, according to people close to the talks. Those banks couldn't be reached for comment.
