Aluminum-ingot prices are expected to remain ``firm'' through 1991 after falling from peak levels a year ago, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Morton</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcan Aluminium Ltd.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ingot</ENAMEX> is cast molton metal that is rolled into sheets for use in making beverage cans, airplane and auto parts, and other products. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcan</ENAMEX> is a large integrated producer of aluminum ingot and fabricated products.
``I expect to see relative stability'' in the aluminum market, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX> told reporters at an aluminum-industry conference here. He said he expects ingot prices to vary ``plus or minus five cents <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S</ENAMEX>''. a pound from current levels of about 80 cents a pound, assuming there isn't a full recession, which he said he doesn't expect. ``All the evidence of a soft landing is there to see,'' he said.
In 1988, prices for aluminum ingot climbed as high as $1.12.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX> said 2% annual growth in aluminum demand through 1991 will absorb any new production capacity coming on stream during that period. He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcan</ENAMEX> believes completion of much of the new capacity announced or under construction will be ``squeezed forward to 1992-1993,'' or about a year later than planned.
He said that if demand grows at an annual rate greater than 2% between now and 1992 the new capacity, much of it being built in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Quebec</ENAMEX>, will be welcome. ``We need people to build {new aluminum smelters}, just not too fast,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX> said.
