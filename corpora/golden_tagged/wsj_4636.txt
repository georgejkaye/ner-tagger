After a short hiatus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandra Kurtzig</ENAMEX> has returned as chairwoman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASK Computer Systems Inc.</ENAMEX> Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurtzig</ENAMEX>, the founder of this maker of management-information software systems, also will assume the duties of president and chief executive officer, posts she also previously held.
In those duties she will succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Braniff</ENAMEX>, who was named vice chairman and will remain a director. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurtzig</ENAMEX> had ceded the president and chief executive posts to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX> in 1985.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurtzig</ENAMEX> appeared to have severed all ties with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ASK</ENAMEX> in February when she resigned as chairwoman, saying she wanted to pursue other business interests. The company didn't return calls seeking elaboration on her return to top management.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Braniff</ENAMEX>'s tenure as president and chief executive was generally marked by revenue and profit growth, the company said earlier this month that slacking demand for its products would result in a decline in profit for its fiscal first quarter ending Saturday.
For its fiscal year ended June 30, ASK saw net income grow 25% to $13.5 million from $10.8 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 30% to $186.3 million from $142.4 million. In over-the-counter trading, ASK was unchanged at $9.25 a share.
