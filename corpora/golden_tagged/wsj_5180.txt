Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss Justice</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisabeth Kopp</ENAMEX> was indicted yesterday on criminal charges of leaking official secrets to her husband in connection with a drug money investigation that led to her resignation.
Special federal prosecutor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph-Daniel Piller</ENAMEX>, said a preliminary investigation has compiled enough evidence to bring charges against Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kopp</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s supreme court.
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kopp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s only woman government minister to date, is also the first to be charged in court.
Two former subordinates also were charged with passing confidential government information.
The supreme court first must rule whether the charges brought by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Piller</ENAMEX> are well-founded enough to be receivable.
In a statement through her public relations agent, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kopp</ENAMEX> denied criminal wrongdoing while acknowledging she made a ``mistake.''
In a telephone call last October to her husband, a lawyer, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kopp</ENAMEX> allegedly urged him to sever ties with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX>-based company, Lebanese-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakarchi Trading AG</ENAMEX>, that had come under scrutiny in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s biggest drug money laundering inquiry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans W. Kopp</ENAMEX> gave up his post as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakarchi</ENAMEX> board vice president shortly before the company was named publicly as possibly involved in the case. No charges have been filed and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shakarchi</ENAMEX> has denied wrongdoing.
