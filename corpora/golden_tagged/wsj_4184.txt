<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>' parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX>, its stock buffeted by rumors following takeover bids for two other major airlines, tried to chill the action by seeking two official investigations into reports about the rumors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> said Friday it has asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> ``to investigate recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> press reports regarding the company.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> officials wouldn't elaborate on the one-sentence announcement.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones & Co.</ENAMEX>, which publishes this newspaper, operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones News Service</ENAMEX> and Professional Investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Report</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIR</ENAMEX>, a news wire for stock traders, specializes in computer-activated alerts on unusual stock trading activity and publishes news reports on causes of that activity. A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> declined to comment.
Both news services have published several items about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> in the past few weeks, including reports last week that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> real-estate developer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX>, who bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> shuttle earlier this year and renamed it the Trump shuttle, has been buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> stock.
Last week's reports also cited rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman, Sachs & Co.</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>'s investment bankers, is restricted on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> stock, meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> traders can't solicit orders for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> stock. That could be an indication that some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> transaction is in the offing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment. The reports also cited rumors of possible interest by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bass</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basses</ENAMEX> have declined to comment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> was quoted in a report in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> Today earlier last month as saying he liked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> stock, and several traders said he was buying the stock openly last week, ``flashing his name around,'' as one put it. Some market observers believe Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> has sought government permission to buy more than $15 million worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> shares. A spokeswoman for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trump</ENAMEX> has often bought stock in companies and then sold after his buying was disclosed and the stocks rose in price on takeover speculation, so his interest wouldn't necessarily presage a bid by him. However, he bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> stock before a stockholder revolt forced a restructuring of that airline company in 1987.
There has also been speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marvin Davis</ENAMEX>, whose bids for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> have already triggered buy-out deals this year for those two airlines, might pursue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> next. A spokesman for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment.
But it could be premature for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX> to pursue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> because he remains the backup bidder for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> if a $6.79 billion offer by a fragile coalition of employees, management and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX> should falter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> may challenge the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>'s $750 million stake in that bid.
The call for investigations is in keeping with the aggressive reputation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Crandall</ENAMEX>, who has vowed to avoid the kind of debt levels involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> takeovers.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crandall</ENAMEX> is believed eager to retain the financial freedom of a low debt level to be able to slash fares to win market share from rivals whose debts might limit their ability to respond. By seeking to douse market rumors during the current airline takeover frenzy, he is evidently hoping to cut the chance that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> is put in play for a takeover.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> stock has gyrated wildly this year amid the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United contests.</ENAMEX> In the past two months alone, it has risen from below $70 a share to an intraday high of $96. In the past month, it has slumped back to the mid-70s before rebounding during the latest round of rumors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> shares rose $2.75 to $86.50 Friday after a $4.75 gain Thurday in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. With volume of over 2.6 million shares, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> was the second most active issue on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> request. One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> staff member said he thought the agency would conduct a routine review. ``I suppose we'll probably look at it, but I don't know what we'll do with it. They're rumors, and I don't know what we could do about them.''
Although the agency is concerned about false rumors and their impact on the stocks of large companies, he said trying to track down the genesis of a rumor is usually a fruitless and time-consuming exercise.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> spokesman said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> had already begun an analysis of trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX> before the request. However, he wouldn't say whether that analysis will be expanded into a fuller investigation.
