<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> said it is considering importing Camry model cars made by its subsidiary in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
Although officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s largest auto maker say it will be some time before a decision is made, there is speculation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> may start importing several hundred cars a month in mid-1990.
Already, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> have been importing cars made by their U.S. subsidiaries.
The growing effort among Japanese auto makers to sell imports through their distribution networks is part of a government-encouraged bid to expand overall imports and cut the nation's hugh trade surplus.
