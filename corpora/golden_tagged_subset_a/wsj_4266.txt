Financially troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE Development Corp.</ENAMEX> said it arranged an 18-month line of credit for as much as 100 million Canadian dollars (US$84.9 million) from a Canadian bank.
The real estate development company said the credit is conditional on receiving a guarantee from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE Inc.</ENAMEX>, which owns 67% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE Development</ENAMEX>. It said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE Inc.</ENAMEX>'s board had approved the guarantee in principle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE Development</ENAMEX> recently said it expected a significant write-down of its real estate portfolio and suspended payment of its preferred share dividends.
In trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCE Development</ENAMEX> closed at C$1.71, up eight Canadian cents.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito Manufacturing Co.</ENAMEX> says it will continue to move cautiously in considering proposals from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T. Boone Pickens Jr.</ENAMEX> until he explains how he became the Japanese company's biggest share owner.
In a letter sent to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX>'s president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takao Matsuura</ENAMEX>, said he would consider ``fully and carefully'' any formal request from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> oil man for a special meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX>'s shareholders. He also said the board of the automotive-lighting maker, a close affiliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Co.</ENAMEX>, will consider a request from Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> that the company raise its interim dividend.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matsuura</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> will continue to view Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX>'s intentions warily until he clarifies his relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitaro Watanabe</ENAMEX>, who once tried to pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> into buying him out at a premium and from whom Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX> bought his 26.2% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matsuura</ENAMEX>'s letter was clearly an effort to rebut an intense public-relations blitz by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pickens</ENAMEX>, who has characterized his inability to win a role at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koito</ENAMEX> as a barrier to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> is encouraging people under 40 to move there under its business-migration program. On Oct. 1, the minimum amount business migrants under 40 will need to transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> to guarantee entry under the program will fall 30% to $260,000, a government statement says. Business migrants aged 58 or over will need $640,000, an increase of 70%. The $375,000 minimum for migrants aged between 40 and 57 remains unchanged. Any migrant admitted today might find it hard to get around: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s domestic-airline pilots, who resigned en masse seven weeks ago over pay, yesterday rejected official mediation.
A review committee overseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s intelligence service released a report suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> could benefit from using secret agents to keep tabs on trading partners. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> doesn't operate a foreign secret service such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Russell</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Toronto</ENAMEX> political scientist who studied the question of foreign spying for the committee, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> needs much more information on major trading partners such as the U.S. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell</ENAMEX> said it would be naive to think the U.S. didn't use covert means to obtain information on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s position during free-trade negotiations last year. ``I think Americans are great people, but they play hardball,'' he said.
Chinese leaders feted 2,793 ``model workers.'' The star citizens, most of them <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> members and ranging from a 16-year-old acrobat to an 84-year-old university professor, were honored at a meeting in the Great Hall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People.</ENAMEX> For several years, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> had neglected model workers, who two decades ago filled the pages of newspapers as examples to the rest of the country, Premier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li Peng</ENAMEX> said in a speech. He called that neglect ``the disastrous result of contempt for people's creative labor caused by the rampancy of bourgeois liberalization.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> could sign a trade pact by year end. A second round of talks on a 10-year trade and economic-cooperation agreement will be held Oct. 9 and 10, and negotiations are expected to run smoothly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>'s commission says. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> hopes imports of Western consumer goods will help allay a wave of popular discontent with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s economic reforms. ``To achieve perestroika, it is essential to open the {Soviet} market to the outside,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vladimir Shemiatenkov</ENAMEX>, Soviet ambassador to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>.
Some 1,500 television producers, directors, and engineers from 27 nations will gather in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> Saturday for three days to find ways of boosting European programs and television technology.
Foreign ministers from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West European</ENAMEX> nations plus the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> will discuss joint production and distribution projects. ``What would remain of our cultural identity if audio-visual <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> consisted of European consumers sitting in front of Japanese TV sets showing American programs?'' asks <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Affairs</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edith Cresson</ENAMEX>.
The Council of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, grouping 23 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West European</ENAMEX> nations, has already agreed to a convention requiring that its broadcasters show a majority of European programs ``where practicable.''
French <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland Dumas</ENAMEX> notes that Europeans produce a mere 2,500 hours of program material a year compared with the 16,000 hours shown on their screens.
The chief neurosurgeon of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyprus</ENAMEX>'s main hospital performed a 45-minute operation on the brain of a sea turtle apparently injured by a ship's propeller, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyprus Mail</ENAMEX> reported. Surgeon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicos Spanos</ENAMEX> said: ``It was not a difficult operation, but undeniably an interesting one.''... Two men admitted in a Scottish court that they scuttled a yacht belonging to a son of the ruler of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubaih</ENAMEX> last month. The $800,000 vessel sank in a loch near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dingwall</ENAMEX>, and the prosecutor told the court that the two on trial held a grudge against the yacht owner's gamekeeper.
