<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Paso Electric Co.</ENAMEX> said it expects to report a loss in the third quarter resulting from a write-down on selling its stake in an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Neb.</ENAMEX>, savings and loan association back to the thrift.
In the year-earlier quarter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> electric utility earned about $21.2 million, or 52 cents a share, on revenue of $187.8 million. A spokesman declined to elaborate on the amount of the expected loss, but said third-quarter results will include an about $22 million loss from discontinued operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Paso</ENAMEX> has recorded close to $100 million in write-downs thus far in 1989 as part of the divestiture of all of its non-utility assets and a regulatory disallowance.
Under the pact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Paso</ENAMEX> will sell back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Federal Savings & Loan Association</ENAMEX> about 600,000 shares of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX>'s preferred stock for $32 million plus interest and dividends. The agreement also calls for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Paso</ENAMEX> to receive seven-year warrants to purchase as many as 1.4 million shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Federal's</ENAMEX> parent company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Federal Corp.</ENAMEX>, also of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Omaha</ENAMEX>, for $15 a share.
