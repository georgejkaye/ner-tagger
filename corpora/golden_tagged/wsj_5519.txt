The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX>, under pressure to toughen its market oversight, fined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel Trading Co.</ENAMEX> $100,000 and ordered it to withdraw permanently from exchange membership for alleged fraudulent commodity-options sales practices.
The Merc action follows a public rebuke by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> in June, when the federal regulator accused the Merc of dragging its feet in investigating such practices at a certain firm, which industry lawyers identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel Trading.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> said it first brought questionable sales practices at the firm to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX>'s attention in 1985.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Benedetto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel Trading</ENAMEX> compliance officer, referred calls about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> ruling to the company's outside attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Phelan</ENAMEX>, who couldn't be reached for comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel Trading</ENAMEX> came under regulatory fire earlier this month when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> filed a complaint in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> federal court against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel</ENAMEX> and another commodity options trading firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Trading Group Ltd.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> said that since 1984 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel</ENAMEX> earned about $40 million in customer commissions trading commodity options, while its customers had losses of $33.6 million trading those options.
The Merc alleged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel Trading</ENAMEX> ``favored its own rather than customers' best interests'' by making trades in customers' accounts without their approval. The exchange alleged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel Trading</ENAMEX> accepted and transmitted customer trades without a predetermined exercise or ``strike'' price, and that the company then chose an exercise price that resulted in a profit for the firm rather than the customer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siegel Trading</ENAMEX> agreed to the fine and withdrawal from membership without admitting or denying the exchange allegations. The company also agreed to keep much stricter records of customer orders, including tape recording all customer solicitations for the next five years.
