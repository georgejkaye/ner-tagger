<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>'s financial problems are sending shock waves through the retailing industry -- and consumers are likely to benefit.
Already, off-price apparel chains, which typically sell brand-name and designer goods for as much as 60% less than department stores, are trying to gain a competitive edge. Some are snapping up goods once destined for such well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> divisions as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham & Straus</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burdines</ENAMEX>. Others are poised to pounce, waiting only for jittery manufacturers to offer them better deals.
Healthy specialty stores and department stores such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nordstrom Inc.</ENAMEX> and those under the far-flung May and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dillard</ENAMEX> umbrellas are expected to grow stronger during the all-important holiday season. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> inventories grow spotty, these competitors are likely to steal business from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores</ENAMEX> units as consumers turn elsewhere for wider assortments. And these healthy competitors, which also include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gap Inc.</ENAMEX>, might benefit by being able to extract concessions from suppliers.
Executives throughout the industry, meanwhile, are raising the prospect of an impending price war. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, they say, could be desperate enough to slash prices in an attempt to pump up sales. ``It's going to be as promotional a Christmas as we've seen in years,'' predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kerson</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter K. Levy Associates</ENAMEX>, a retail consulting and executive search firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Farmer</ENAMEX>, a retail consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boca Raton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, says she has seen ``more prominent markdown racks'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan Marsh</ENAMEX> stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rich</ENAMEX>'s stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> in recent days, indicating ``what appears to be a more heightened urgency to clear markdown merchandise.'' In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> spokeswoman declined to comment.
This much is clear: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Despite Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX>'s rescue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> with a $250 million loan this week, prompting many vendors to resume shipments to the stores, retail executives don't believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s financial woes are over. ``It sounds to me like a spit in the ocean,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Abramson</ENAMEX>, president and chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clothestime Inc.</ENAMEX>, an off-price chain and one of many retailers that stands to gain from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s problems and consumers' perceptions about the company.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX> ``will need more money to fund his business,'' contends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Davidowitz</ENAMEX>, a retail consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``Unless he can arrange a lot more financing, he won't be able to order and receive enough goods to make holiday sales.''
Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. The company's problems stem from a liquidity crunch caused by high debt levels in the wake of the real estate concern's acquisitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clothestime</ENAMEX> hasn't yet bought any goods intended for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stores, but Dress <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barn Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stamford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burlington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, have purchased some goods. ``We're starting to buy clothes in all classifications,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliot Jaffe</ENAMEX>, chairman of Dress <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barn</ENAMEX>, a women's apparel chain.
Some apparel makers, meanwhile, are making contingency plans to sell through their own factory-outlet stores any goods they decide not to ship to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stores. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips Van Heusen Corp.</ENAMEX>, the men's shirt maker, for instance, won't sell to off-price stores, choosing instead to unload any surplus goods through its factory outlets, says President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Klatsky</ENAMEX>.
``The potential is there for retailers such as ourselves to benefit from the unfortunate adversity of others,'' says an executive at another chain, who requested anonymity.
Some of the benefit might be purely psychological. With talk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s financial problems and potential merchandise shortages turning up on the evening news in recent days, some industry consultants say, consumers may start thinking differently about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stores. ``That sends a message to consumers, which is probably false, that we're talking about a markdown of whole companies,'' says Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farmer</ENAMEX>, the consultant.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> chains could appear so weak to consumers that healthy competitors could gain market share ``by default,'' adds Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX>.
But healthy chains might also be able to outmaneuver the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> units with flashier merchandise displays and advertising efforts, simply because many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> executives and middle-level managers are taking their eyes off the ball. Instead of concentrating only on business, they may be placing calls to headhunters and fretting about their futures.
``Our phones have been ringing off the hook,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kerson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter K. Levy</ENAMEX>. He says his firm has been contacted by dozens of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> executives over the past two weeks. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phyllis Tama</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thorndike Deland Associates</ENAMEX> says about 30 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> managers from all levels have called her search firm. ``The advantage to competitors at this point is temporary and psychological,'' says one industry executive, who requested anonymity. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> has unbalanced inventories and executives who are as nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof.''
Since most stores are now ordering spring merchandise and making plans for next year's promotional events, it may take months for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> to feel the sting of its staff's distraction. And by then, industry observers say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> could be in the midst of another cash crisis.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> plans to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s to pay off some of its staggering debt, several industry observers say that might not solve its problems. ``Each time you sell something off to reduce debt, you reduce cash flow,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Tigert</ENAMEX>, a marketing professor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Babson College</ENAMEX> and a retailing expert. ``You could have another cash flow crunch.''
For now, though, consumers look like the biggest winners. ``There'll be a lot of goods available for low prices for Christmas,'' predicts Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abramson</ENAMEX>.
