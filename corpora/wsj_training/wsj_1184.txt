<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> executives and lawyers provided ``misleading and false'' information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> in 1985 in an effort to cover up ``longstanding fraudulent'' billing practices, federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs.
The government's startling allegations, filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> federal district court, challenge the motives and veracity of the nation's third-largest defense contractor.
In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> asserted that ``prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses, distorted documents and ignored important facts.'' The company attacked the government's allegations as ``reckless and baseless mudslinging,'' and said its management ``promptly and accurately reported'' to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> all relevant information about billing practices.
The case strikes at the corporate image of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>, which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Defense Initiative</ENAMEX>, and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> officials take a tough stance.
The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices. But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of ``widespread'' fraudulent billing practices.
The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Systems</ENAMEX> division, which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985. The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case, in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos, reports and documents. Last November, a federal grand jury indicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $21 million on a logistics computer contract.
The company, for its part, maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that shouldn't be turned over to prosecutors. A hearing is scheduled on the issue today.
The government's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> was accused of defrauding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> by illegally claiming cost overruns on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minuteman</ENAMEX> missile contracts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $1 million in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minuteman</ENAMEX> case, which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> court.
In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts, prosecutors contend that ``high-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> executives'' and company lawyers provided ``misleading statements'' to then-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verne Orr</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials during a series of meetings in 1985.
Overall, the government contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s disclosure efforts largely were intended to ``curry favor'' with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations.
Prosecutors depict a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from 1983 to 1985, despite warnings from an internal auditor. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> finally disclosed the problems, prosecutors contend that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> ``was erroneously informed that the {suspected} practices had only just been discovered'' by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> management.
In its brief, the government asserted that it needs the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> documents to rebut anticipated efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> during the trial to demonstrate ``its good corporate character.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>, which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents, countered that senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> managers didn't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985, and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> at his first meeting with company representatives. Subsequent meetings, initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts, were held to familiarize Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> with the company's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity.
The company's conduct ``does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent, ratification or cover-up,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX>'s brief asserts. ``On the contrary, it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orr</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.
