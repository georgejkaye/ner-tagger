The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> Composite Index declined 0.07 to 467.77 on 123.2 million shares.
There wasn't much damage to big computer stocks on the OTC market in reaction to news from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX>, whose shares are traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, that its thirdquarter earnings would fall well short of analysts' expectations.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Len Hefter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jefferies & Co.</ENAMEX>'s OTC desk in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> observed, ``Sellers don't seem to have the clout that they have had in the past to knock the market down and keep it down. Buyers creep back in at the end.'' But he said there might be a delayed negative reaction today from some investors to yesterday's news. A block of three million shares of First Executive convertible preferred was sold to a ``knowledgeable investor who took a new position'' in the issue, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ward</ENAMEX>, managing director of the convertible arbitrage department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX>.
