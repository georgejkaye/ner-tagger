Oh, that terrible Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX>. Just when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American liberalism</ENAMEX> had pulled the arms plug on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> and their friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>, along comes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Costa Rica</ENAMEX> this weekend to ``blunder'' into the hands of what are often called conservatives. Conservatives are the faction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> politics which always said that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> and his friends don't want to hold an election in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>. Liberals are the faction that says, Give peace a chance; now they are saying Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> should give them a break, lest the conservatives ask them to vote for bullets instead of bandages.
We suspect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Ortega</ENAMEX> knows the difference between a blunder and a strategy. He knows that making <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> look silly in a photograph with him will trigger Noriegan fulminations, and that announcing an end to the liberals' cease-fire will produce mainly their concern over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX>' military activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern Nicaragua</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> understands better than those who worry about his behavior that what sustains the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandinista</ENAMEX> movement is not democratic peace, but nondemocratic unpeace. It is the presence of internal and external ``enemies'' which justifies the need for a large, active army that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> continues to supply with bullets.
