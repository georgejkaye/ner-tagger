<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra On-Line Inc.</ENAMEX> said it expects net income in the second quarter ending Sept. 30 to be flat compared with year-earlier operating profit of $789,000, mainly because of a new marketing agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>
Most analysts had been expecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX> to report net income in the $900,000-to-$1.2 million range. In the year-earlier quarter, tax credits of $494,000 boosted net income $1.3 million, or 48 cents a share.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX>, which makes computer games, said the marketing agreement calls for it to supply <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> with certain products that will be sold with some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> personal computer models over the year-end holiday season.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Heinbockel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX>'s chief financial officer, said that meeting the production demands of the agreement will result in reduced sales of some other products for the next few months. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sierra</ENAMEX> will supply the products to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> at costs below what it would ordinarily charge, pinching profit margins.
Even so, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinbockel</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> agreement a ``marketing coup'' that he predicted would spread the word about Sierra products and provide long-term benefits for the company.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heinbockel</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX> remains ``comfortable'' with analysts' projections that second-quarter revenue will fall in the range of $6.5 million to $7 million, well above the $5.6 million posted in the year-earlier second quarter. The company declined to give specific revenue or net income projections for the current quarter.
In the first quarter ended June 30, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX> earned $635,000, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $4.1 million.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX> rose $1.125 to $17.
