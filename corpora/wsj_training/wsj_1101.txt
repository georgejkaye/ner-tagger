<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israel</ENAMEX> has launched a new effort to prove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine Liberation Organization</ENAMEX> continues to practice terrorism, and thus to persuade the U.S. to break off talks with the group. U.S. officials, however, said they aren't buying the Israeli argument.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israeli</ENAMEX> counterterrorism officials provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> with a 20-page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasser Arafat</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> publicly renounced terrorism Dec. 15, satisfying the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> precondition for a direct ``dialogue'' with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX>.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. counterterrorism</ENAMEX> official said experts are studying the Israeli list. ``We have no independent evidence linking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fatah</ENAMEX> to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15, 1988,'' he said, referring to the specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> group that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> heads. ``So far, this list doesn't change our view. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israel</ENAMEX> wants to end the dialogue, but our analysts take a different view than theirs.''
Israeli Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yitzhak Shamir</ENAMEX>'s top adviser on counterterrorism, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yigal Carmon</ENAMEX>, was here Monday to present the report to members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, reporters and others. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmon</ENAMEX> said he also presented the list last week to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Brown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>.
Separately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> reported that the Israeli government had provided its correspondent in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> with different documents that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> said prove the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> has been conducting terrorism from the occupied Arab territories. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> said it hasn't yet seen copies of those papers.
``If the dialogue was based on the assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> would stop terrorism, and we have evidence of continued terrorism, what would be the logical conclusion?'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carmon</ENAMEX> asked.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israel</ENAMEX> has long claimed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> never meant to renounce terrorism, particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right to press ``armed struggle'' against the Jewish state. Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> says it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX>. It blames most of these on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fatah</ENAMEX>.
The new accusations come at a delicate time in U.S. efforts to bring about talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> and Palestinian representatives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> said it had received a new letter on the subject from Israeli Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moshe Arens</ENAMEX>, restating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s previous objection to negotiating with any Palestinian tied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX>.
Deciding what constitutes ``terrorism'' can be a legalistic exercise. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> defines it as ``premediated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents.'' To meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> criteria, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> contended it only listed incidents that involved civilians and occurred inside its pre-1967 borders.
At the heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s report is a list of a dozen incidents <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> attributes to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fatah</ENAMEX>, including the use of bombs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molotov</ENAMEX> cocktails. But U.S. officials say they aren't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah, the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> doesn't classify as terrorism. In addition, the officials say <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> hasn't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fatah</ENAMEX> or by any group Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> controls.
U.S. terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>. The papers, which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> says were discovered in Israeli-occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gaza</ENAMEX>, refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called ``the Revolutionary Eagles.''
Some supporters of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> say U.S. policy on Palestinian terrorism is colored by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> officials accuse <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> of leaking questionable claims to embarrass the U.S.
