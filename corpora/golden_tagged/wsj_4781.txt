The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX>'s policy-making panel agreed to reach an accord by year end on increasing the agency's resources.
The panel, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s 22-nation interim committee, also said the fund will vigorously try to resolve the problems with member countries in arrearage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>. Payments arrears, which increased by more than $1 billion in the year ended April 30, 1989, are an increasingly serious problem for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>.
Even if terms for increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s resources are worked out by Dec. 31, it could be another two years before the 152 member countries ratify their commitments, the chairman of the interim committee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">H. Onno Ruding</ENAMEX>, said at a news conference yesterday.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruding</ENAMEX>, who is finance minister of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX>, emphasized the need to make speedy progress on the issue of expanding the fund's resources. He acknowledged the differences of opinion among members about the proposed increase, but said he expected that an increase of between 50% and 65% in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s current resources would be agreed on eventually.
IMF Managing Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Camdessus</ENAMEX> is campaigning for an increase of 100% in the fund's resources, which now total about $120 billion. He is backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> has said it is willing to consider an increase by the end of this year, but maintains that a persuasive case hasn't yet been made for an increase. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> apparently favors an increase of about 70%, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> has proposed a 25% boost.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>, which lends its resources to member countries to compensate for short-term balance-of-payments problems, said it needs increased funding to keep pace with world economic growth and to cope with new areas of responsibility, such as supporting international debt relief. The resources consist of member countries' quotas, which are reserves these nations place with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>.
Any increase in quotas is certain to be accompanied by a reordering of the quota percentages among fund members. The current quotas are dated and no longer reflect relative economic strengths. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> is the second-largest shareholder, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> ranks fifth.
It is widely expected that as part of any quota increase, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> would drop to fourth place, equaling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> would move up to the second spot, ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. ``We're willing to be on the same level as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>,'' French Finance Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Beregevoy</ENAMEX> said at a press breakfast yesterday.
Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the largest contributor, wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">IMF</ENAMEX> to address its arrearage problems and also wants to see the agency's role better defined before any capital increase is set.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX>'s annual report for the year ended last April 30 said arrears totaled about $3.6 billion and ``remain a serious problem.'' Of that amount, $3.5 billion was overdue for more than six months, up from $2.37 billion as of April 30, 1988.
In a communique released yesterday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> interim committee called for more action on clearing up arrears. It urged ``all members to assist the Fund in the implementation of the cooperative strategy'' on the problem. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> officials said that although the arrearage problem is growing, it is mainly attributable to a hard core of recalcitrant countries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zambia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guyana</ENAMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> argued for a cooperative approach with debtors on arrears. But if a country won't cooperate, the fund may be forced to take more drastic measures, such as barring countries from participating in quota increases or even expelling the nation from the agency.
