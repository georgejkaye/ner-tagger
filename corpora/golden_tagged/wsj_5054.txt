Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Ruderman</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drake</ENAMEX>, ``admitted to me he can not afford to go forward with Venture'' and is seeking a buyer for the equity interest he acquired.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lipper</ENAMEX>, who sold Venture to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drake</ENAMEX>, said that while the magazine was closing, it could be resurrected with the help of new investors or owners.
