<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Rice</ENAMEX> used to feel put upon. As a franchisee of a computer store, he was forced to hand over to his franchiser a percentage of total sales, even though one-quarter of his $4 million in annual revenue came from consulting and other services he had built up on his own.
``I was paying on every dollar that came through my business,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Annapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>, businessman says.
No more. Last December, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entre Computer Center</ENAMEX> store and the other 184 shops in the chain were acquired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics Inc.</ENAMEX>, and with the new franchiser came a new set of rules. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Sanford</ENAMEX>, the founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX>, never liked the rigidity of franchising as it's usually practiced, and he had thrown it all out the window.
Traditional franchising is a proven way to grow in a hurry. And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX>'s experience with fast-growing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> suggests that even greater rewards may come when the concept is modified to custom-fit a business. His approach is also inspiring a major structural shift in computer retailing as other large franchisers, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microage Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tempe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, follow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX>'s lead. Businesses in other industries that lend themselves to franchising may not be far behind them.
Under standard franchising agreements, the franchiser offers a business format, including nearly all products and services, in exchange for a royalty, that is, a percentage of gross sales. Franchisees are essentially a captive market for a franchiser's products, often having to buy items they don't want or need and pay for services they don't use.
The 45-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> has unbundled the package of products and services and done away with the royalty. His company's principal role is selling to franchisees certain computer products, mostly made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> His profit comes from middleman markup instead of a percentage of retail sales. If franchisees want additional services, such as training or help in getting a loan, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> provides them for an additional fee.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX>, in effect, acts like a distributor. Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Exton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, company is still technically a franchiser because franchisees are under contract to buy the microcomputer systems made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> that are distributed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX>.
The margin for flexibility is the difference. While the bulk of merchandise offered in the stores comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX>, dealers are also free to buy other products or services from outside sources and pass up any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> services they aren't interested in. For instance, if a dealer wants to sell an Apple computer that isn't on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX>'s list, it can get it through another distributor.
The arrangement also frees <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> from many of the hand-holding services franchisers provide, saving on personnel and other overhead costs. The company says it is able to pass on some of that savings in the form of lower product prices to its franchisees.
``We looked at the model that was out there and saw it was archaic,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> says.
``It is a very novel concept,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Reynolds</ENAMEX>, marketing director for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Franchising Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> ``To unbundle the package seems counter to the idea'' of franchising.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX>'s empire has grown incredibly in a short time. Revenue at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> soared last year to $130 million from a mere $115,000 in 1984, when the business was just getting going. In the nine months ended in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, revenue rocketed further to an estimated $648 million.
Five months after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entre</ENAMEX> was meshed with the 200 or so franchisees he already had, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Connecting Point of America</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>-based retail computer chain with 245 stores. Over the past year alone, employment at the computer-store franchiser has swollen to 650 from 60, not counting any franchisee workers. With 740 computers stores, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> is now one of the largest companies of its kind. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX>'s 20% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> is currently worth more than $35 million.
The acquisitions have catapulted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> into a leading market position. But the rapid growth also may endanger the primary advantage Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX>'s approach to franchising provides: cost-saving efficiency in an intensely competitive, price-sensitive business.
While net income doubled to an estimated $9.2 million during the nine months ended July 31, profit margins fell to 3.9% from 5.8% a year earlier, as general expenses soared nearly sevenfold. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> will be pressed to reduce such costs at a time when his company is running on negative cash flow from operations, trying to pay for some $117 million in acquisitions amid signs of a softening microcomputer market. (At an analysts meeting in late <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, software maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft Corp.</ENAMEX> predicted that the rate of growth for microcomputer unit sales would fall to 10% during the ensuing 12 months, one-half the rate of the past three years.)
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> became an entrepreneur in 1982, after leaving Commodore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Ltd.</ENAMEX> and forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX>. At first he tried to sell microcomputer systems through leased space in department stores. That worked until a competitor -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Depot</ENAMEX> -- doubled the fee paid to host stores in an effort to win sales space. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Depot</ENAMEX> eventually went out of business, but not before other department stores started demanding its generous terms, which, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> says, wrecked the economics of the business.
In 1984 Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> took a new tack to find outlets for the computers he was selling. Instead of setting up budding entrepreneurs with brand-new franchises in big cities, as most computer retailers did, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> chose to sign up previously established independent office-products dealers outside highly competitive major metropolitan areas.
After years of concentrating on copiers, typewriters and such, these office-products dealers were eager to join in the microcomputer boom, which largely had passed them by. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX>'s recruits typically boasted 15 years of experience and solid reputations, so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> saved on training costs and advertising to promote the dealerships. The dealerships kept their names but added to their signs ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Todays Computers Business Center</ENAMEX>,'' a slogan to link the chain together.
The independence of the office-products dealers fit nicely with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX>'s view of franchising. ``We weren't interested in a cloning system,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford</ENAMEX> says. ``We were interested in participating in the dealers' customer base, in maintaining their independence as an entrepreneur.''
As the industry's profit margins fell, the savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX> offered on its computer systems lured even computer dealers franchised by other companies. The company's cafeteria-style menu of services was an additional attraction; it appealed to mature computer dealers that were still being forced by their franchisers to pay for support they no longer needed.
``I'm pretty self-sufficient,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, the owner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entre</ENAMEX> store in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Annapolis</ENAMEX>, says. ``I never took advantage of the programs Entre developed -- and in many cases they had to come out with programs just to justify the royalty.''
``The difference between being with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entre</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligent Electronics</ENAMEX>,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> added, ``is probably worth a couple of points on the bottom line.
