(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CORTES WESLEY RANDELL</ENAMEX>, a 32-year old promoter, on April 25, 1968, founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Student Marketing Corp.</ENAMEX>, which briefly became a hot stock before it flunked out. Major lawyers, accountants, investment houses and college endowment funds flunked along with it.
NSM based its glamour on an on-campus sales force that sold a range of things from posters to class rings to pillows for counterculture sit-ins. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randell</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NSM</ENAMEX>'s soaring stock to buy 25 companies in 12 months. He also bought a $600,000 house, a 55-foot yacht and a private jet.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSM</ENAMEX> wasn't really doing that well. Its earnings in the year ended Aug. 31, 1969, were inflated by including acquisitions before they were acquired. On Nov. 5, 1969, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randell</ENAMEX> predicted a near triple gain for fiscal 1970 earnings; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSM</ENAMEX> stock leaped by $7. Company insiders unloaded shares.
It all caved in on Feb. 16, 1970, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSM</ENAMEX> said it expected a first-quarter loss. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randell</ENAMEX> resigned three days later. And 18 embarrassed investment houses watched their clientslose  $100 million.
Responding to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> complaint, a federal judge on July 27, 1972, enjoined <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NSM</ENAMEX> from any further violations of antifraud and reporting laws. NSM consented to this without admitting or denying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> charges.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randell</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to stock fraud and in December 1974 drew an 18-month prison sentence and $40,000 fine. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSM</ENAMEX> officers and a former Peat, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell & Co.</ENAMEX> partner (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSM</ENAMEX>'s auditors) also received prison sentences.
The case became controversial when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> charged that two law firms should have blown the whistle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White & Case</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bissell & Brook</ENAMEX> denied all wrongdoing. But in 1977 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White & Case</ENAMEX> settled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> conditionally dropped its action against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord Bissell</ENAMEX> in 1980. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSM</ENAMEX> was liquidated in 1981.
