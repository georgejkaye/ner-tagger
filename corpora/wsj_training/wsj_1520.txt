The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Environmental Protection Agency</ENAMEX> is getting a lot out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superfund</ENAMEX> program. Of the $4.4 billion spent so far on the program, 60% is going for administrative costs, management and research, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Technology</ENAMEX> Assessment just reported. Only 36 of 1,200 priority cleanup sites have been ``decontaminated.'' Over the next 50 years, $500 billion is earmarked for the program. At current allocations, that means <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> will be spending $300 billion on itself. It may not be toxic, but we know where one waste dump is.
