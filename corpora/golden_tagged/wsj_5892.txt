<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX> will have greater influence in the management of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> under terms of its $250 million loan to the struggling real-estate and retailing concern.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Campeau</ENAMEX> ``is no longer calling the shots on his own,'' said a finance executive close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>.
In a statement late Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> said it agreed to the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> convertible loan. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> said it still needed its banks' approval of the loan's terms and conditions, which include postponing the due date of an $800 million loan to April from January. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> is an investment holding and real-estate development concern closely held by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>'s wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reichmann</ENAMEX> family.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> also said Friday that a management group reporting to a committee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> directors will ``take charge'' of refinancing and restructuring the company's cash-starved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores</ENAMEX> units. As previously reported, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> intends to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomingdale</ENAMEX>'s department store chain to reduce the company's $10 billion of debt.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> ``will definitely be represented'' on the board committee, but she didn't know if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> would be part of it or whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J. Debartolo Corp</ENAMEX>. and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s banks would also have representation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debartolo</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Youngstown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>-based developer, lent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> $480 million during its $6.6 billon takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> last year and has a 7.5% equity stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated.</ENAMEX>
Executives close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> said the two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> officials currently on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s board, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Reichmann</ENAMEX>, chairman, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lionel Dodd</ENAMEX>, chief operating officer, will be on the special committee. They said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> will have a major influence on the refinancing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> and on the possible sale of other department-store chains. Also, it's expected that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> loan will be convertible into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stock, reducing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s fully diluted stake in his company to less than 50% and boosting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s current 25% stake.
The delay in getting its lenders' approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> loan meant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied Stores</ENAMEX> unit missed the interest payment due Friday on one series of junk bonds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> said it paid the interest on its 10 1/4% senior notes due 1992 but didn't pay the interest on its 11 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due 1997. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> said it has a 30-day grace period within which to make the payment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied</ENAMEX> didn't indicate the amount of the overdue payment, but analysts said the aggregate interest due Friday on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Allied</ENAMEX>'s high-yield bonds was about $50 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> also missed the deadline Friday by which it had to either secure financing commitments to buy back $401 million of notes held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Inc.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillon, Read & Co.</ENAMEX>, or give the underwriters the right to take up 6.96% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated's</ENAMEX> common stock. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the status of the notes is ``still open to discussion'' with the underwriters.
Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> stock was halted Wednesday and didn't resume Thursday or Friday.
