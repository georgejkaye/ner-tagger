<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon Corp.</ENAMEX> said it will move its headquarters from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manhattan</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>.
Most of the 300 employees at the oil company's midtown headquarters building -- including much of senior management -- were unaware of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence G. Rawl</ENAMEX>. The shift won't affect operations. As part of its restructuring several years ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53-floor Rockefeller Center skyscraper to a Japanese company.
But the pullout is an embarrassment to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> officials, coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil Corp.</ENAMEX> is in the process of vacating its headquarters here, and huge operations like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.C. Penney & Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> have recently left.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> authorities, informed yesterday about the move, reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it. ``We are dismayed, but there's nothing we can do about it now,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Grayson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> deputy mayor for finance and economic development.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> welcomed the move. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX> officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in, but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Everglades.</ENAMEX>''
``When we were told it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX>, it was beyond all expectations; what a coup,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lewis</ENAMEX>, senior vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Partnership</ENAMEX>, the economic development affiliate of the city's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, its economy based on oil and real estate, has been in a slump.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> said it will build a new headquarters on a 132-acre tract in the 10-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> complex in the suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irving</ENAMEX>. Until the building is completed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> will rent part of an existing office tower. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Colinas</ENAMEX>, once a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> ranch, is a sprawling complex of office buildings, homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to populate in recent years.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> officials said it will cost less to run its headquarters at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Colinas</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. The company won't say how much it will save, but during at its interim location, sources say it will likely pay rent of $10 to $15 per square foot. Owners of the building in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> say they will be asking $50 per square foot for rent to fill the space that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> is vacating. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, taxes and development costs are also lower, they said.
Plus, one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exxon</ENAMEX> official said, by eliminating the typically long <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> commutes between office and home, management will expect employees to work 40 hours a week in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>, rather than a 35-hour work week in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
