<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ko Shioya</ENAMEX> spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> has been a major importer of foreign information and news,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shioya</ENAMEX>. ``But one gets fed up with importing information and news.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shioya</ENAMEX> has turned the tables. Today, he is publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Tokyo magazine</ENAMEX>, the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business. After a slick redesign, the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keizaikai Corp.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based company with interests that include financial services, book publishing and a tourist agency. Printed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and carrying the line ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Insider</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>,'' Business <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s October cover story was ``The World's No. 1 Customer'' -- Japanese women.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keizaikai</ENAMEX> is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing, after making major investments in entertainment, real estate and banking companies here. Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based investment banker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veronis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suhler & Associates</ENAMEX>. And they are quietly linking up with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> publishing trade groups.
``Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Veronis</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veronis Suhler.</ENAMEX> While there aren't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>'s recent $3.4 billion agreement to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</ENAMEX>, observers don't rule out a transaction of that size. ``The Japanese take the long view''. said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Veronis</ENAMEX>. ``It may not be weeks or months, but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable, they will move on a deal,'' he said.
In recent months, three big <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based publishing concerns -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei Business Publications</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikkei</ENAMEX> Home (no relation), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine House</ENAMEX> -- applied for membership in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine Publishers of America</ENAMEX>, which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines.
Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> are considered groundbreakers. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keizaikai</ENAMEX> launched Business <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> in 1987, it appealed to a more multinational audience. The magazine was overhauled with the aid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American magazine</ENAMEX> design gurus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Glaser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Bernard</ENAMEX>, and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers.
American publishers appear more than ready to do some selling. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susumu Ohara</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc.</ENAMEX>, publisher of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Economic Journal</ENAMEX>, said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine.
``The Japanese are in the early stage right now,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Kenney</ENAMEX>, a onetime media adviser for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> who was recently appointed president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest Association</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magazine Publishing Group</ENAMEX>. ``Before, they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft. Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nabisco</ENAMEX> is a franchise.
