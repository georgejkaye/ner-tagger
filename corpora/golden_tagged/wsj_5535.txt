The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> is facing criticism that it took far too long to bring charges of fraud against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Trading Group Ltd.</ENAMEX>
Last week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> announced the filing of the largest sales fraud case in its history, charging that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> had used high-pressure sales tactics to bilk customers out of hundreds of millions of dollars.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> didn't say it has been aware of questionable actions at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> for more than a decade.
Over the last 12 years, at least two states and one futures exchange have provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> with evidence against the options brokerage firm. In addition, an industry group fined ITG $90,000 for using allegedly fraudulent sales tactics. Over the same period, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> received 212 consumer complaints against the firm, which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Mateo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> began investigating ITG in 1985 and filed suit in U.S. District Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> last week. Investors who lost money with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> are asking why the investigation -- and subsequent charges -- were so long in coming. So are former investigators for one state agency that pursued the firm, and some commodities lawyers.
``This is a resource-intensive undertaking,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> enforcement chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Klejna</ENAMEX>. ``We were able to concentrate resources on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> with the ability to take on these firms only recently.'' He declined to discuss the specifics of the matter, such as how long the investigation took, citing the agency's pending litigation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Diamond</ENAMEX>, an attorney for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX>, denies the firm has acted illegally, and says it intends to fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>'s suit. He also argues that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> is wrongly presuming that stressing the positive in sales pitches to potential customers without conveying all the negative amounts to misrepresentation by the firm.
Making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> case even more interesting is the presence at the firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Konigsberg</ENAMEX>. Currently <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX>'s executive vice president, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Konigsberg</ENAMEX> used to be a staff attorney in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office. He couldn't be reached for comment.
Unlike the securities business, where excessive commissions are barred, there are no legal limits on the cut a commodities broker can take. Moreover, the financial instruments that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> sells are legitimate. Thus the only area where a futures firm selling to small investors generally can be charged is sales practices, commodities lawyers say.
It can be difficult to establish a pattern of fraud across an array of options on different commodities. The fact that most of those sales are made by telephone makes the job even more difficult because investigators need to demonstrate that a given conversation is representative of widespread abuses within a firm.
One commodities lawyer notes that before 1985 the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> was primarily concerned with cracking down on abuses at unregistered operations, and didn't focus much on registered firms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ultimately</ENAMEX>, whether or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> prevails in its lawsuit, the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> illustrates just how little individual investors in exotic financial instruments can rely on regulators to protect them. Over the last five years, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>'s suit, the firm made $283 million in commissions, while its customers, most of them small investors, had losses of $428 million.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> was first put on notice about the firm a dozen years ago. The state of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> thought the firm sufficiently suspect to notify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> in 1978, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Henney</ENAMEX>, who investigated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Bureau of Corporations and Securities.</ENAMEX> ``As a result of our investigation into the commodities, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> moved out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>,'' he says. ``There was a lack of follow-up by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> investigators say they found sales  tactics similar to those described in last week's CFTC suit and believe they might have won a case against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> had the firm not moved its operation out of the state and their jurisdiction.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diamond</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX>'s attorney, says he wasn't aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX> inquiry, but called it ``ancient history, totally irrelevant,'' because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> was selling different products and had a different approach at that time.
Before <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Michigan</ENAMEX>'s investigation was complete, ITG registered with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Secretary of State as an out-of-state corporation and set up an office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coconut Grove</ENAMEX>. By February 1986, the state comptroller, whose office handles consumer complaints, had received enough complaints to start an investigation. The results of that inquiry were turned over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> because its jurisdiction supersedes the state's, according to a spokesman for the state comptroller.
In 1981, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> became a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Futures Exchange</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. Soon the futures exchange began investigating the firm and turning over its findings to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>. People familiar with that investigation say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> opened a file on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> in 1985. It isn't clear what the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> exchange did with the information it found.
In March 1987, ITG left the exchange of its own volition, according to an exchange spokeswoman. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> did so because it didn't feel that the exchange was sufficiently knowledgeable about the options the firm sells to supervise it properly, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diamond</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> had joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Futures Association</ENAMEX>, an industry self-regulatory body, in 1983. By 1985 the association began investigating the firm. Last year it charged ITG with fraudulent, high-pressure solicitation and misrepresentation of potential profits and risks. ITG neither admitted nor denied the allegations but agreed to pay a penalty of $90,000. Seven of its employees were barred or suspended from the industry.
But in 1987, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Hsu</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> office to complain about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX>, he says he was told that there were no pending complaints against the firm, and that there were no grounds for any investigation.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said she could neither confirm nor challenge Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX>'s account, but noted that under usual procedures he would have been told the number of complaints against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX>, but not their substance.
Discouraged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX>'s response, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> says he decided against lodging a complaint. Thus, he says, he was all the more surprised when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFTC</ENAMEX> filed suit last week against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX>, alleging the same sort of misconduct he had tried to report two years ago.
In the 41-page complaint, the agency alleges ITG told prospects that ``you don't have to think it over -- you must take action now.'' The complaint alleges that ``at every stage of its customer solicitation process, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ITG</ENAMEX> makes false, deceptive, or misleading statements and fails to disclose material facts.''
Two people who have heard ITG pitches since the complaint say that the firm's salesmen, when asked about the federal action, blamed the trouble on a few ``bad apples at the firm who have been removed.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> pays $90,000 fine
