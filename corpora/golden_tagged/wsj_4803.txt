<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup Co.</ENAMEX> is betting that the marketplace of the future is outside the U.S.
For the past several years, the company that made its initial fortune putting condensed soup on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> grocery shelves has pushed hard to establish market niches overseas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> has bought about a dozen small and medium-sized food companies that make fancy cookies, frozen foods and ``shelf-stable'' products, such as pasta and other packaged and canned goods. Many of the acquisitions have been in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, where the planned removal of trade restraints in 1992 offers a shot at 320 million consumers.
Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> wants to build up its overseas businesses even more aggressively, boosting their contribution to 40% of sales by the early 1990s from 27% currently. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Gordon Mcgovern</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive, says he considers his company's ability to do business around the world ``a matter of survival.''
But so far, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> hasn't convinced everyone that it knows what it's doing overseas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s foreign presence is still small compared with that of other U.S. food companies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPC International Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.J. Heinz Co.</ENAMEX> And global competitors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestle S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> and the British-Dutch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever Group</ENAMEX> dwarf <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> in both size and market share. In such a tough environment, there is little room for costly errors, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> has made plenty.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX> operations accounted for 45% of the $343 million pretax charge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> took last month against fiscal 1989 earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan. As part of the plan, five unidentified plants outside the U.S. will be closed and about 830 overseas employees will lose their jobs. The pretax charge included a $116 million write-down of good will in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>. (For the year ended July 30, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> had net income of $13.1 million, or 10 cents a share, on sales of $5.67 billion, compared with year-earlier net of $274.1 million, or $2.12 a share, on sales of $4.87 billion.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s global push began in the early 1980s, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgovern</ENAMEX> persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> directors that the company had to act fast to counter moves by rival U.S. food companies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPC</ENAMEX>, which had been aggressively courting foreign consumers for decades. ``We were extremely vulnerable,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgovern</ENAMEX> recalls.
The company initially decided to expand quickly through acquisitions, rather than spend years building support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>-brand products. It also moved rapidly to acquire or establish affiliations with other companies to improve distribution.
But some food-industry analysts fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s recent problems may be a sign that the company tried to expand too fast, especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. ``They haven't got a handle on their European businesses,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Mcmillin</ENAMEX>, analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</ENAMEX>
Moreover, Wall Street speculates that the restructuring at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> is being prompted by members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> family, who hold the 58% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> stock that had been controlled by the family patriarch, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Dorrance</ENAMEX>, who died this spring. The younger Dorrances are pushing for a greater say in company policy and are viewed as taking a harder line on the company's profitability than did the late Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s two most troubled overseas subsidiaries are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D. Lazzaroni & Co.</ENAMEX>, an Italian cookie maker, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freshbake Foods PLC</ENAMEX>, a British frozen-foods producer recently consolidated into a new subsidiary called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Foods PLC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Argabright</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell International</ENAMEX> division, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazzaroni</ENAMEX> has been hurt by overproduction and distribution problems, primarily in a seasonal cake business acquired last year that ran into trouble when it overestimated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s market for Christmas cakes. The company had to slash prices to unload the excess supply. ``You could buy cake cheaper than bread,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Argabright</ENAMEX> recalls.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> says it has replaced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lazzaroni</ENAMEX>'s top management and is looking at ways to improve distribution, possibly through a partnership with an Italian food company that has supply lines throughout the peninsula.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freshbake</ENAMEX>'s difficulties may be tougher to solve. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> says a new management team will soon take care of the short-term problem: consolidation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freshbake</ENAMEX>'s many small divisions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s other British operations.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> won't have an easy time snatching market share in the British frozen-foods category from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX>, the leader with a 22% share, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Biscuits PLC</ENAMEX>, with 19%. A distant third, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freshbake</ENAMEX> has about 12% of the market, most of it in the low-margin, ``private label'' segment, where it makes products for supermarket chains to sell under their own names.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> says it intends to switch more of the division's output from private-label to more profitable brand-name products -- most likely under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> name -- the high cost of competing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> food market worries some analysts. A common complaint by investors is that the price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> paid  for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freshbake</ENAMEX> -- $201 million, or 24 times earnings -- was too much for a company with little brand recognition.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX>'s international drive has had some successes. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, for example, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> has concentrated on the gourmet-food and import markets, business is booming. Sales for the premium-food businesses rose 15% in fiscal 1989 as operating profit climbed more than 35%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cookies</ENAMEX> did even better, more than doubling profits on a 25% rise in sales. Italian dishes are particularly popular among German shoppers, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> has taken advantage of the demand by purchasing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s leading supplier of imported pasta, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Theodor Kattus G.m.b. H.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> is also pleased with the performance of its French specialty candy company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lamy-Lutti S.A.</ENAMEX>, which has increased its share of the growing specialty sector to 45% from 30% in the past four years and increased operating profit more than 20% in the last year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> believes its global operations are essential to developing markets for U.S. products abroad and vice versa. It cites as an example its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepperidge Farm</ENAMEX> subsidiary, which made a big hit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> with its international cookie collection. The cookie designs came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.V.</ENAMEX> Biscuits <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delacre</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> cookie company that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> later acquired.
Now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> hopes to apply the formula in the opposite direction, with the export of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepperidge</ENAMEX>'s ``American Collection'' cookies to foreign consumers.
Success is by no means guaranteed. Competition in the European cookie market is very tight, and ``there's going to be a shakeout one way or the other,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mcgovern</ENAMEX> recently told securities analysts in a private meeting.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> executives are confident the company can prosper. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell</ENAMEX> may have a modest world presence today, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Argabright</ENAMEX> says, but ``you start with niches and grow to notches and then grow to segments.
