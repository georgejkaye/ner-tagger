Through a takeover bid it didn't want or expect to succeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlin Holdings Pty.</ENAMEX> has tripled its stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders IXL Ltd.</ENAMEX>, raising speculation some Elders assets will be sold to handle the nearly two-billion-Australian-dollar (US$1.55 billion) transaction.
Far from aiming to accumulate a large stake in the brewer, last month's offer was designed to appease critics who objected to a separate plan by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> -- which already owned 18% of Elders -- to acquire as much as 17% more from a small group of holders at A$3 (US$2.33) a share. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Detractors</ENAMEX> thought all holders deserved the chance to sell at that price.
When the one-month general offer closed Wednesday, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> found that 21.5% of Elders shares had been tendered, including 110 million shares, or 6%, on the final day alone. Combined with a 15.5% stake derived from the special transaction that touched off the controversy, the tendered shares pushed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>'s holding in Elders to 59.3%.
Initially, analysts had expected no more than 100 million shares, or 5% of the total, to be tendered in response to the general offer, which was widely viewed as undervaluing the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>'s strategy went awry, analysts say, because Elders's annual earnings, disclosed last week, disappointed investors. Moreover, Australian stock prices have weakened recently.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> is a closely held company controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Elliott</ENAMEX>, several Elders executives, the Elders pension fund and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFP Group PLC</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based investment company.
The tide of acceptances of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>'s offer caused its debt load to balloon, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Buckley</ENAMEX>, an analyst at securities firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macquarie Equities Ltd.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> has ``got to act quickly'' to reduce its debt, he says.
Analysts doubt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> will make another, higher offer for Elders -- a step it might be expected to take in order to complete its ownership of the company and gain access to its cash flow. They think it is more likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> will offer investors more equity in itself, or perhaps persuade Elders, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s biggest companies with interests in brewing, financial services, natural resources and agribusiness, to sell assets and return the cash to Elders shareholders.
If Elders assets are sold, analysts believe the ones that could go first are Elders's 4.7% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mcgee Corp.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based chemical-and-resource company; a 13.5% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British brewer Greene King & Sons PLC</ENAMEX>; and an approximately 23% holding in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish & Newcastle Breweries PLC</ENAMEX>, which British corporate regulators have stipulated must be cut to below 10% by July 1990 anyway.
Elders also holds a 14% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX>, parent company of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> in the U.S.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Max Ware</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>'s managing director, declined to comment on market ``speculation'' about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>'s course of action. Elders also refused to comment.
Analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>'s original intention was to simply tighten its control over Elders, mainly by grabbing up to 17% of shares held jointly by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFP Group</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd.</ENAMEX>, an Australasian food concern, through another company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petitio Ltd.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> didn't want to get stuck with a big expensive holding if it wasn't at least a 90% stake.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodman Fielder</ENAMEX> wanted to sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petitio</ENAMEX> stake and, in May, Elders proposed to offer the 17% parcel to other shareholders at A$3/NNP a share. Because Elders was trading below A$3/NNP, it appeared unlikely that many shareholders would pay the asking price being asked. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>, underwriter of the sale, would acquire most of the stake. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders</ENAMEX>'s share price, though, rose to around the A$3/NNP level after the general offer was announced.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, following criticism of the limited offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> announced plans to make a general offer at A$3 a share, valuing all of Elders at A$5.4 billion. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders</ENAMEX> directors urged shareholders to reject it. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Australia Ltd.</ENAMEX>, acting as an independent expert, valued Elders shares at a higher range of A$3.36 to A$3.79 each.
To finance the general takeover offer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> lined up a package of loans and got several international companies to agree to take so-called standby equity in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlin</ENAMEX>, with the amounts varying depending on the number of Elders shares that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlin</ENAMEX> acquired. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX> said its original shareholders, including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elliott</ENAMEX>, would maintain voting control of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>.
Among the international companies that agreed to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlin</ENAMEX> are Canadian brewer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molson Cos.</ENAMEX>, with which Elders has a joint brewing venture in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Interfunding Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cie</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Financiere de Suez</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Metropolitan PLC</ENAMEX>, which brews some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elders's Foster's</ENAMEX>-brand beer under license in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hongkong Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> agreed to arrange loans for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harlin</ENAMEX>.
