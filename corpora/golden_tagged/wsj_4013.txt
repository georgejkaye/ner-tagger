Regarding your Sept 8. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Petroleum Co.</ENAMEX> story about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Horton</ENAMEX>, I take strong exception to such phrases as ``an unusually brash Briton'' and the nickname ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX> the Hatchet'' (given when he cut a division's work force by 60%).
As a financial analyst for an investment-management firm, I have followed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horton</ENAMEX>'s career closely. Any informed person knew how he agonized over the difficult decisions that had to be made to turn around BP in the early 1980s. He was acutely aware of the human costs involved in necessary restructuring, and he tried to be as fair as he possibly could be.
