<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benjamin Jacobson & Sons</ENAMEX> has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> specialist firm in charge of trading stock in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> and its predecessors since the early 1930s.
But the firm has never had a day like yesterday.
At first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> didn't open because of an order imbalance. When it did a half-hour into the session, it was priced at $150 a share, down more than $28 from Monday's close. It sank further to as low as $145, but a big rally developed in the last half hour, pushing the stock back up to close at $170, down just $8.375 from Monday. In the process, 4.9 million shares traded, making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> the second most active issue on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>.
Munching pizza when they could and yelling until their voices gave out, the two Benjamin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> specialists at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trading post yesterday presided over what can only be described as a financial free-for-all.
``It was chaotic. But we like to call it'controlled chaos,''' said 47-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Jacobson Jr.</ENAMEX>, grandson of the firm's founder. He manned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> post yesterday with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Bates</ENAMEX>, 33, an energetic Long Islander who's a dead ringer for actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicolas Cage</ENAMEX>.
Who was doing all the selling? ``Options traders, arbitrage traders -- everyone,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX>, cooling down with a carton of apple juice after the close yesterday. Added Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX>, ``There were some pretty bad losses in the stock.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> traders said a 200,000-share buy order at $150 a share entered by Bear, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stearns & Co.</ENAMEX>, which was active in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock all day, is what set off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> crowd in the late afternoon. A subsequent rally in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an 80-point deficit to finish only slightly below Monday's close.
Both Jacobson traders, who had been hoping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trading would get back to normal, read the news about the unraveling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning. The news told them it would be a while longer before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations. When Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> walked into the office at 7:30 a.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EDT</ENAMEX>, he announced: ``OK, buckle up.''
Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> walked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> floor at about 8:45 a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble. Already entered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>'s computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> shares.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market, in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>, which closed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> Monday at $178.375 a share, traded in the third market afterward as low as $158 a share. There were rumors of $148-a-share trades.
In the 45 minutes before the 9:30 opening bell, the Jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders, heavier than they imagined. And at 9:15, they posted a $135 to $155 ``first indication,'' or the price range in which the stock would probably open. That range was quickly narrowed to $145 to $155, although traders surrounding the post were told that $148 to $150 would be the likely target.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> finally opened a half hour late, some 400,000 shares traded at $150. There was ``selling pressure from everyone,'' said one trader.
This month's Friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> news wasn't as bad for the Jacobson specialists as yesterday's action. On that earlier day, the stock's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath. Not yesterday.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX>, his gray hair flying, didn't wear out his red-white-and-blue sneakers, but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new shirt.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> usually handles day-to-day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> trading on his own. But yesterday, the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> but four other Jacobson partners, all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market. About 30 floor traders crammed near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> post most of the day, and probably hundreds more came and went -- a ``seething mass,'' as one trader described it. The 4.9 million-share volume flowing through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock.
The heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a ``massive buying effort'' as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> jumped $20 a share to $170 in the last half hour, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX>. With 15 seconds of trading to go, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobson</ENAMEX>, with what voice he had left, announced to the trading mob: ``We're going to trade one price on the bell.'' That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds, as a way of making sure that last-second orders aren't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset customers.
About 11,000 shares sold at $170 on the bell, representing about eight to 10 late orders, the specialists estimate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> traders praised the Jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> spokesman, ``by way of policy,'' declined to comment on the company's stock or the specialists' performance.
Leaving the exchange at about 5 p.m., the Jacobson specialists made no predictions about how trading might go today. Said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl Ellis</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobson</ENAMEX> partner who got involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> action, ``It all starts all over again'' today.
