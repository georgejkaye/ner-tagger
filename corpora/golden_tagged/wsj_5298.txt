<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horizon Financial Services Inc.</ENAMEX> said it offered to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Savings & Loan Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Elyria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, for about $14.2 million.
Terms include paying holders $65 a share in cash, although Horizon may use its shares as part of the purchase price.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horizon</ENAMEX> said the offer could be lowered based on any added expense incurred in a lawsuit by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horizon</ENAMEX>. Earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horizon</ENAMEX> wrote to Northern holders with a bid, but Northern sued, claiming Horizon broke securities laws. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horizon</ENAMEX> has withdrawn its previous offer.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horizon</ENAMEX>'s current offer is set to expire Sept. 25, if Northern hasn't accepted it.
