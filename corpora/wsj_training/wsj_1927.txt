Whether or not ``great cases make bad-law'' -- as Justice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> asserted -- who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethan Bronner</ENAMEX>'s ``Battle for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>: How the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bork Nomination Shook America</ENAMEX>'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norton</ENAMEX>, 399 pages, $22.50) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings, done with journalistic verve, but with a flawed legal philosophy. While the book amply justifies its subtitle, the title itself is dubious. What shook <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> was not a battle for justice but for naked power, in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demonized.
In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic, with piquant character portrayal, hard-wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> docudrama than in a constitutional history.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronner</ENAMEX> seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way. I doubt that. Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments, the contingency plans in place, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX>'s paper trail of vulnerable writings, it was pretty clear that Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> never stood much chance of being confirmed. As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronner</ENAMEX> himself says, the smell of ``raw meat'' was in the air.
Perhaps because they won, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX>'s attackers come through more vividly than his defenders. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Neas</ENAMEX> was the organizing genius, whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurence Tribe</ENAMEX> was the constitutional heavy, laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow. But it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Kennedy</ENAMEX> who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bork</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'' -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically, he claimed, from the positions Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> had taken over the space of two decades. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>, never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground, emoted brilliantly.
I add two others. Republican Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlen Specter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area (free speech) while remaining rigid in all the others. It achieved a good media play, and enabled Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Specter</ENAMEX> and others to vote against Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> out of ``conscience.'' Further ammunition came from left legal theorist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Dworkin</ENAMEX>, who in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Review of Books painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution, particularly in the area of ``original intent.'' The charge of being ``outside the mainstream'' of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX>'s scholarly standing, leaving him bleeding on the platform.
The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> had broken party lines. But Democratic Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett Johnson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX> reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next Senate elections. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Demographics</ENAMEX> converged with ``mainstream'' and demonizing to seal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bork</ENAMEX>'s fate.
The upshot? Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX>'s opponents chose the battlefield, held it and kept it. Yet with the smooth confirmation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Kennedy</ENAMEX>, an ``80 percenter'' only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX>, the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war.
Another upshot, however, was the chilling message the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> draws its talent. The word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey, with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen.
Unfortunately, the author simply doesn't supply the philosophical frame to sustain his reportorial talents. He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture. Probing more deeply into the doctrine of ``judicial restraint,'' he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Holmes</ENAMEX>. He would discover it also in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Bickel</ENAMEX>, a subtle constitutional scholar, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX>'s closest friend at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX>, whose influence on the judge goes well beyond Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bronner</ENAMEX>'s reporting.
Still, the long view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bork</ENAMEX> as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one. His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine, which keeps the Court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives. Unfortunately, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere.
The question of segregated schools, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Education</ENAMEX>, was such an issue. In our time abortion has become another, best left to a line of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures. A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters (decided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Griswold</ENAMEX> case) to abortion as well. One can understand Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX>'s fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched, though a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> composed of men and women with realism, guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it. What is certain is that if Americans allow another happening like the degrading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bork</ENAMEX> confirmation circus, it will be at their peril.
