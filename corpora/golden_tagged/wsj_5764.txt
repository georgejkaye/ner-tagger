It looks like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> securities brokers won't be going to real estate school after all.
Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Deukmejian</ENAMEX> is widely expected to sign Senate Bill 1209, a measure to exempt licensed broker-dealers from a requirement to also be licensed as real estate brokers. The bill was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> state legislature last week.
The real estate license requirement, which applies to business brokers, protects sellers of grocery stores, gasoline service stations and other businesses. However, a recent appellate court decision extended the requirement to include mergers-and-acquisitions specialists engaged in traditional investment banking activities.
The court decision was so sweeping, attorneys said, that it could be applied to most large transactions, such as a tender offer to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> investors by an out-of-state company. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Industry Association</ENAMEX>, a large trade group, retained a law firm to get an amendment to the state code passed before the end of the legislative session Friday.
``There's no opposition to the bill,'' said a legislative assistant in the office of Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Garamendi</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sacramento</ENAMEX>), who introduced the measure for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Industries Association</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Realtors</ENAMEX> and the state departments of corporations and real estate agreed with the language, said the aide.
