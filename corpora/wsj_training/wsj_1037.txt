<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is going on a capital-spending binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink.
Its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row, and its superefficient producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity, modernize factories and develop new products.
``The boom's so huge,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitsuru Saito</ENAMEX>, an economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanwa Research Institute</ENAMEX>, ``it makes you think of the Golden'60s,'' when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> developed rapidly.
The more factories and robots Japanese manufacturers add, the more they will be able to export, and the less their domestic customers will need to import.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canon Inc.</ENAMEX>, for example, sales are up nearly 20% this year; so, the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any Japanese company would do under the circumstances: It is increasing capital spending -- by 60%. It is building, among other things, a new laser-beam-printer factory in western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> that can produce up to 150,000 printers next year. Some 70% of them are to be exported to the U.S.
Even companies in smokestack industries wrestling with world-wide overcapacity are joining the boom. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s steelmakers are raising capital spending 22% this year to $4.8 billion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi Zosen Corp.</ENAMEX>, a shipbuilder buried in debt just a few years ago, will build a machinery plant, its first expansion in 14 years.
So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies' outlays in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> topped American companies' domestic outlays by $521.4 billion to $494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s.
From a financial standpoint, the boom couldn't come at a better time. Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year, and Japanese interest rates, though up a bit recently, are still low. And in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends, companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment.
But some economists and government officials here aren't applauding. They fear that the boom may be too big for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s or anyone else's good. ``It's an explosive cocktail'' thrown at the world, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Courtis</ENAMEX>, senior economist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deutsche Bank Group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</ENAMEX> is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MITI</ENAMEX> officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the U.S.
Not everyone is worried, however. Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings. The investment boom is mainly sparked, they say, by strong domestic demand and isn't likely to increase exports sharply.
Moreover, much investment isn't aimed at increasing capacity. According to a survey of some 2,400 large companies by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Development Bank</ENAMEX>, expanded capacity is the goal of just 51.8% of the outlays; for manufacturers alone, the figure is 32%. The manufacturers said 14.2% of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones, 17.5% is to cut costs, 12.5% is for research and development, and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes.
But the worriers remain unconvinced. With <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world, they think that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more. And eventually, they contend, domestic demand will weaken, forcing companies to emphasize exports again. ``If there's a further drive to export,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobuyuki Arai</ENAMEX>, an economist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Development Bank</ENAMEX>, ``that'll be a problem.''
Even in the short run, the investment boom could exacerbate a disturbing trend: Japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease. Japanese auto makers, for example, are increasing their production capacity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>; the additional production should, in part, replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones. But although Japanese companies increased their U.S. auto output by 42% from January to September compared with the year-earlier period, their exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> will drop only 9% this year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikko Research Center</ENAMEX> estimates.
In contrast to previous economic booms, Japanese auto companies aren't just trying to boost production. Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and, to some extent, to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. Others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once. So many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fanuc Ltd.</ENAMEX>, a robot maker, also had to build a new plant. The buildup is ``making <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> clearly more efficient, more technologically advanced and more competitive,'' declares a Western diplomat in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
But whatever its effects on exports and imports, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s marathon economy, growing at 4.3% this year, is now in its 35th month of expansion, and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s.
Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money, especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s domestic auto sales are up 20% this year largely because its expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cima</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sylvia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cefiro</ENAMEX> models are in heavy demand.
``One dealer told me that if he had more cars, he'd sell them right away,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takuro Endo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> executive vice president. He adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand ``by overworking'' its employees. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Motor Co.</ENAMEX>'s sales are so brisk that workers grumble they haven't had a Saturday off in years, despite the government's encouragement of more leisure activity.
With demand growing and workers in short supply, many Japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation. Among them are the shipbuilders, which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasebo Heavy Industries Co.</ENAMEX>, a medium-sized shipbuilder, expects its sales to increase 30% this year, largely because of rising demand for oil tankers.
Once one Japanese company steps up its investments, the whole industry follows. Because most businesses put market share above profitability, to let a competitor's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat.
The emphasis on market share is evident at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daikin Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s biggest maker of industrial air conditioners. Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daikin</ENAMEX> is building another plant, which will lift its production capacity 50%. The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company's market share to 30% from 27% currently. Besides, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daikin</ENAMEX>'s major competitors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX>, ``are all adding production lines,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daikin</ENAMEX> spokesman says. ``Until now, we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had. But we can't produce enough anymore.''
The competition is even more heated in the auto industry, where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> aims to expand its 25% share of the market to 30% by spending $141 million on a plant in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Motor Corp.</ENAMEX>'s $247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> is spending $317 million on expansion. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda Motor Corp.</ENAMEX> is still considering its options, but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to 800,000 cars in the next four years.
Those who aren't worried about how Japanese manufacturers' investments will affect trade note that many new products aren't replacements for imports. Although imports account for less than 1% of beer sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asahi Breweries Ltd.</ENAMEX>, which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer, plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50% more beer. But new-product development will make Japanese companies stronger, and big investments in ``domestic'' industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the Japanese market.
Moreover, much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which Japanese companies have only limited foreign competition; so, more investment practically assures more exports. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX>, for example, is spending $986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories, the next generation of computer chips. The product isn't widely used yet, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX>, which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drams</ENAMEX>, believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again. ``It's important to gain leadership,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX> spokesman says.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba</ENAMEX>'s Japanese rivals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC Corp.</ENAMEX>, aren't sitting still. After doubling production in one plant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC</ENAMEX> is spending $275 million to build another plant that, in two years, will be able to make a million four-megabit Drams a year. The new chip plants ``won't be excessive investment,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hajime Sasaki</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC</ENAMEX> vice president. ``We have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products.''
Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>'s $35,000 Lexus automobile, a luxury model that it started shipping to the U.S. only last month, is racking up orders at a time when U.S.-made luxury-car sales are slow. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> plans to raise Lexus exports when a new plant starts up next year.
What if its sales weaken someday? Japanese companies have a caveat competitor attitude. If excess capacity develops, they say, not everyone will suffer. The losers will be those with the least attractive products, and many of them, analysts think, will be foreign companies.
