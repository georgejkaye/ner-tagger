Diery</ENAMEX>, who quit recently as executive vice president of troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang Laboratories Inc.</ENAMEX>, president of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Pacific</ENAMEX> unit.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diery</ENAMEX> was also named a senior vice president of the parent company. He succeeds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delbert W. Yocam</ENAMEX>, a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> executive who has held many posts at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>, including chief operating officer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yocam</ENAMEX> announced last year that he intended to leave Apple to pursue other interests.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diery</ENAMEX> will head up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s operations in the markets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>.

Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diery</ENAMEX>, 39, resigned from Wang last month after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lowell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, concern reported a record $424.3 million net loss for the year ended June 30 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick A.

In his 11 years at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diery</ENAMEX> rose to become the most powerful executive outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang</ENAMEX> family, but he was blamed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Wang</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> insiders for optimistic sales forecasts that led the company to maintain its huge and costly sales and administrative staffs in the face of declining sales.
Before his troubles at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diery</ENAMEX>, a bluff, dynamic Australian, had led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang</ENAMEX>'s highly successful European sales operations. He was brought to the U.S. in 1986 and put in charge of U.S. sales. His last position at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang</ENAMEX> was executive vice president in charge of world-wide field operations.
