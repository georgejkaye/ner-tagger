Completion of the acquisition is subject to execution of a definitive agreement, approval by all three companies' boards and the approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Solar</ENAMEX>'s shareholders. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Solar</ENAMEX> spokesman said completion is expected at the end of the year or early next year.
A spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> aerospace and defense concern said it wanted the acquistion because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Solar</ENAMEX> is involved in solar cells and solid-state laser components, and this fits with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mcdonnell</ENAMEX>'s business of laser applications for military space.
