When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael S. Perry</ENAMEX> took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event, more than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX>, who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever Group</ENAMEX>'s world-wide personal-care business, paused to scan the crowd. ``I see we have about half the audience working for us,'' he said, tongue in cheek. ``The other half, we may have before long.''
Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously; their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Unilever</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Anglo</ENAMEX>-Dutch packaged-goods giant, spent $2 billion to acquire brands such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Faberge</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Arden</ENAMEX>. It now holds the No. 3 position at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> department-store cosmetic counters. Then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble Co.</ENAMEX> agreed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell Corp.</ENAMEX> for $1.3 billion. That acquisition, to be completed by year end, will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines, making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets.
It's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper, sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout, sparking fear. Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics, there's little doubt they will shake up the industry.
For now, both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans. But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies. Likely changes include more emphasis on research, soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing. But some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estee Lauder Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revlon Inc.</ENAMEX> and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives. Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year, and since most products can be easily copied by competitors, they're loath to test them with consumers.
``Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods, it doesn't mean they are packaged goods,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard Lauder</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estee Lauder</ENAMEX>. ``They're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars.''
In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits. Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>, in particular, rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing. Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business. Consider Oil of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olay</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> acquired as part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richardson-Vicks International</ENAMEX> in 1985. The moisturizer, introduced in 1962, had a dowdy image. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oil of Olay</ENAMEX> brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Williams</ENAMEX>, a consultant with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Consulting Group</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin. It also redesigned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oil of Olay</ENAMEX>'s packaging, stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her mid-30s vowing ``not to grow old gracefully.'' The company says sales have soared.
Goliaths like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals. Next year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX> plans to roll out a perfume called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George L. Bunting Jr.</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noxell</ENAMEX>. Without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>'s backing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noxell</ENAMEX> might not have been able to spend the estimated $5 million to $7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands. Packaged-goods companies ``will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunting</ENAMEX> says.
Further consolidations in the industry could follow. Rumors that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> is interested in acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering-Plough Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maybelline</ENAMEX> unit are widespread. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> won't comment; <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Schering</ENAMEX>, however, denies the brand is for sale.
The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics. While the two are among the world's biggest advertisers, most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads. Instead, they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estee Lauder</ENAMEX>, for example, spends only an estimated 5% of sales on advertising in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lauder</ENAMEX> says he has no plans to change his strategy.
The most dramatic changes, however, probably will come in new-product development. Nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Shore</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> That figure has been inching up for several years. As the trend continues, demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase. This fall, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L'Oreal Group</ENAMEX>, ordinarily a high-end line, rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plenitude</ENAMEX>, which retail for $5 to $15.
The packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products. Unlike the old-line cosmetics houses, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX>, in fact, is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition. Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year, for example, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics.
That's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands. ``There will be more emphasis on quality,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guy Peyrelongue</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosmair Inc.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> licensee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L'Oreal</ENAMEX>. ``You'll see fewer gimmicks.''
But success for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P&G</ENAMEX> is far from guaranteed, as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business. In the 1970s, several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate-Palmolive Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eli Lilly & Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfizer Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering-Plough</ENAMEX> acquired cosmetics companies. Industry consultants say only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering-Plough</ENAMEX>, which makes the mass-market Maybelline, has maintained a meaningful business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colgate</ENAMEX>, which acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helena Rubenstein</ENAMEX> in 1973, sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> already has experienced some disappointment. The mass-market Aziza brand, which it acquired in 1987 along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chesebrough</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pond's Inc.</ENAMEX>, has lost share, according to industry analysts.
The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unilever</ENAMEX> is concentrating its efforts, may prove even more treacherous. In this niche, makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions. Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned, careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important. And cultivating a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $15 for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own.
