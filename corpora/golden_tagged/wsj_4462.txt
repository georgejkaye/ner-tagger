<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDT Corp.</ENAMEX> said it expects sales and net income for the fiscal second quarter, ending Saturday, will be below first-quarter levels, when the company earned $811,000, or 16 cents a share, on sales of $26.7 million.
In the year-earlier fiscal second quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDT</ENAMEX> earned $1.3 million, or 25 cents a share, on sales of $25 million. The company makes sterility-assurance systems and other medical equipment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Miles Branagan</ENAMEX>, chairman and president, said that recent efforts to boost production levels, sharply higher materials costs last fall and winter, difficulties associated with integrating a new product line, lower bookings and other factors ``are expected to damp second-quarter results somewhat more than earlier thought.'' The company expects to post second-quarter results about Nov. 1.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Branagan</ENAMEX> also said the company has been unable to make between $500,000 and $750,000 of shipments because of damage from Hurricane Hugo to its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, manufacturing facility. However, the company said that it expects damage to the facility and its contents was ``minimal,'' and that power and communications should be restored within three weeks, with operations to resume shortly thereafter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charleston</ENAMEX> facility accounts for about 12% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDT</ENAMEX>'s sales.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDT</ENAMEX> shares closed at $7.75, off 37.5 cents.
