I take up my pen, just to give you an imperfect account of the most dreadful hurricane that memory or any records whatever can trace, Good God It seemed as if a total dissolution of nature was taking place. The roaring of the sea and wind -- fiery meteors flying about in the air -- the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning -- the crash of the falling houses -- the ear-piercing shrieks of the distressed, were sufficient to strike astonishment into Angels.
Actually, the pen writing those lines was that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Hamilton</ENAMEX>. At the age of 15 the future Secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> was living on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> when the fearsome hurricane of 1772 struck the island. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX> dashed off his description and submitted it to The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Danish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Gazette</ENAMEX>, the chief English-language newspaper of the islands, held at that time by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denmark</ENAMEX>. It was the turning point of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX>'s life. The hurricane struck on Aug. 31. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX>'s account appeared on Oct. 3. Influential islanders discovered the article's author and forthwith dispatched him to the mainland to improve his education and carve a career.
When the late summer winds began to knock the shutters, young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX>, stuck in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruger</ENAMEX>'s counting house, heard opportunity knock, too, with a chance to better his lot. He was not the only one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>'s history to see the bright side of a dark hour. Earlier, in 1733, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> was afflicted, in order, by drought, hurricane, a plague of insects, another hurricane, starvation and then, imposed upon <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>'s African slaves, the infamous Gardelin code, named for the Danish governor and described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Boyer</ENAMEX>, author of ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX>: A History of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Rights</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wrongs'' (Carolina Academic Press</ENAMEX>, 1983) as perhaps ``unparalleled in world history as one of the most barbarous and oppressive measures ever imposed on a people.''
The Gardelin code stipulated mutilation and torture for almost any manifestation of discontent by the island's slaves who finally rose in rebellion and for six months held the island against assaults by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danes</ENAMEX>, as well as British and French troops summoned by the panic-stricken <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norsemen</ENAMEX> to their aid.
There may have been some young emulator of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamilton</ENAMEX> scribbling notes when hurricane Hugo hit the islands of the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>, on the evening of Sept. 17. If so, no newspaper chose to give immediate publication to his report. Amid headline stories two days later about the destruction in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and fears for what the hurricane boded for the mainland, almost nothing was written about the fate of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> beyond a brief note that from 30% to 70% of the island's homes had been destroyed, along with most power and communications equipment, and that looting had occurred.
Four days after the hurricane came headlines about the ordering of troops to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> after looting had broken out. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Evening News</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Vasquez</ENAMEX> reported that ``the residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> are overjoyed to see the soldiers (1,100 military police dispatched by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>) from the mainland.''
The word ``residents'' is loaded and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vasquez</ENAMEX>'s wrap-up lines were also unintentionally revealing: ``For...  tourists the nightmare is ending. For the residents, the question is whether to start rebuilding shattered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> or leave with them.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> is at least 75% black, and the looting seems to have been a very understandable attempt by the black poor to get a more equitable distribution of the island's resources.
For most of the black native inhabitants of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> the word ``nightmare'' has rather longer-term reverberations. But even the short-term mainland response was dismal. While the French and the British were rushing emergency supplies to nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadeloupe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montserrat</ENAMEX>, the best that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX> could do was send a C-141 transport with radio equipment and a bunch of bureaucrats in search of the facts. What Crucians needed was food and, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atherton</ENAMEX> Martin of the policy group The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Gap</ENAMEX>, electricity to work their water-tank pumps. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Belatedly</ENAMEX>, all they got was troops.
Statistics are extremely hard to come by, but people knowledgeable about the islands all agree that the post-hurricane popular defiance of law on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> was not unexpected. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prof. Boyer</ENAMEX> says that ``given the crime and disaffection of natives who are against people outside taking over their island, I'm not surprised by the instability caused by the hurricane.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Birns</ENAMEX>, director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council on Hemispheric Affairs</ENAMEX> calls <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> ``a classic example of the immiserated conditions of a Third World country.''
Though the car license plates say ``American Paradise,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>'s schools, roads and hospitals are all in poor shape. A 1976 statement by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>'s health employees said conditions were poor enough to ``cause the strongest to cry in anguish,'' and in 1979 both general hospitals in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgins</ENAMEX> had their accreditation withdrawn. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Hospital Association</ENAMEX>'s latest data, this accreditation has not yet been re-instated. Unemployment and underemployment hovered around 30% before the hurricane, according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birns</ENAMEX>. The native blacks mostly get a crack at only the lowest-paying jobs. Businesses and better jobs go mostly to mainland whites, particularly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>, and to other blacks and Hispanics from elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. Until 1966, a publicly funded body called the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virgin Islands</ENAMEX> Corporation supervised development with the objective of providing employment to native <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Crucians</ENAMEX>, but in the mid-1960s this rather successful body yielded to private development, notably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvey Alumina and Hess Oil.</ENAMEX> Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hess</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> received numerous tax rebates and tax holidays of one sort and another, employment opportunities for locals remained very limited, Prof. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyer</ENAMEX> found.
Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>'s big mistake in recent years was not to have had a revolution, even if one destroyed by a larger power, as did the island of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grenada</ENAMEX>, several hundred miles farther south. Immediately after President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grenada</ENAMEX>, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Birns</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government spent more on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grenadian</ENAMEX> roads than it has ``cumulatively in the entire history of the U.S. administration in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>.''
The nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> got in modern times to revolution was the killing of seven whites and one black in 1972 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fountain Valley</ENAMEX> golf course, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurance Rockefeller</ENAMEX> as part of a 1964 Rockefeller purchase of 4,400 acres for a tourist resort. This investment fueled a speculative boom, which, by the end of the 1960s, saw almost all the beaches of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Thomas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX> gone to ``development.'' Five black youths were eventually convicted for those killings, which remain as vivid in the minds of the white ``residents'' as, no doubt, the 1733 slave rebellion did for earlier settlers.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Croix</ENAMEX>'s original Indian inhabitants were exterminated by the Spanish. The slaves and their descendants have been variously maltreated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">French</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Americans</ENAMEX>, and are now a minority in the islands. Only for the desperate can hurricanes be opportunities.
