(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT</ENAMEX>'S BRAINTRUSTERS talked about health insurance for the elderly as far back as 1935, when Social Security was taking shape. It would take 30 years and four presidents before anything happened. Bills were introduced regularly to the Congresses of the'40s and'50s. All failed. Not until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyndon Johnson</ENAMEX> overwhelmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Goldwater</ENAMEX> in the 1964 presidential election and brought a fresh array of Democrats into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> was action finally taken.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Truman</ENAMEX> opened a 15-year battle in 1950 with his proposals for medical insurance for the elderly. Point man was his health administrator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Ewing</ENAMEX> (to the horror of partners at his old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> law firm). <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arrayed</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing</ENAMEX> was the might of organized medicine, physicians, hospitals and insurance companies.
Seniors did get some help, but it was primarily as proverty relief. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F. Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hubert Humphrey</ENAMEX>, while senators, sponsored such legislation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr-Mills</ENAMEX> Act of 1960 (named for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kerr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means Committee</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Mills</ENAMEX>) added new federal money for medical care, but it was still relief. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> administration tried -- and failed -- for three years to change things. By this time, the program had a new name, Medicare, borrowed from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> plan for the armed forces.
After his election sweep, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBJ</ENAMEX> made medical insurance for the elderly his first priority. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had a new attitude, and stalwarts like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mills</ENAMEX> sensed that members wanted a medical bill. Even old opponents of hospital insurance pushed old-age health care. Medicare became law, for those above and below the poverty line. For the signing ceremony, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Independence</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>, to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Truman</ENAMEX>, then 81, witness the end of the fight he had begun 15 years before.
