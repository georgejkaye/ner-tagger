<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chip</ENAMEX>'s Memory Is Here
Today, Here Tomorrow
TWO COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off.
Today's most widely used data-storing chips have ``volatile'' memories -- their data disappear if they aren't fed a steady diet of electricity, so they need external power supplies.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX> and a start-up named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramtron Corp.</ENAMEX> plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories, which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them. The chips use materials, such as lead zirconate titanate, to form microscopic switches that retain their data without electricity.
Developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology isn't fully refined. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramtron</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December. The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment, including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Semiconductor</ENAMEX> is getting ferroelectric technology from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krysalis Corp.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albuquerque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.M.</ENAMEX> National says it agreed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Krysalis</ENAMEX>'s assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips, including a 4-kilobit memory, next year.
Once production hurdles are overcome, the chips could take over a significant part of the market. In addition to not needing an outside power source, they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips.
Military buyers have shown interest, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> says, because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation. And while today's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- can't be used in a computer's central memory because they ``learn'' data slowly, ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds.
Showing Up in Court
Without Being There
AN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">AUSTIN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town.
Witnesses often must travel long distances to give face-to-face depositions before lawyers and court reporters. That means huge travel bills. And telephone or videotape depositions just don't match physical encounters.
That could change, thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Video Telecom Corp.</ENAMEX>, which markets videoconferencing systems, is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow depositions by live television.
The company installed a prototype system that connects <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> over digital phone lines. And it is preparing to set up shop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and 10 other cities where court-reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network.
While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before, the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper.
An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $200 and $400, depending on the quality of the picture, to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities.
Japanese Reverse Tack
On Patent Protection
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAPAN'S MISUSE</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> patents has been a sore point for American chip makers. Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables.
Until now, most Japanese charges have been responses to suits against them. But last year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> surprised <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s electronics industry when it accused <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samsung Electronics Co.</ENAMEX> of using <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips. (A settlement was reached but wasn't made public.) And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> went on the offensive against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola Inc.</ENAMEX> earlier this month with a suit charging that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>'s new MC88200 chip infringes on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> patent.
Another recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> suit accuses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> of reverse engineering a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology -- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers.
The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is starting to take.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> made the reverse-engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed in a federal district court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> for patent violation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> charges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> ``has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> patents'' used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MC68030</ENAMEX> microprocessor chip.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Translation</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> appears to have taken a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> technology that is patented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hitachi</ENAMEX> says, and ``tried to make it look like a new technology.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> either denied or wouldn't comment on the various charges.
Odds and Ends
COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharp Corp.</ENAMEX> They mimic the brain by ``looking'' at an image, extracting the fundamentals -- boundaries, corners and lines -- and translating them into computer data. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharp</ENAMEX> says the set of chips could improve fax machines, graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features.... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">An N.V. Philips</ENAMEX> unit has created a computer system that processes video images 3,000 times faster than conventional systems. Using reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC, chips made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intergraph</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huntsville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, the system splits the image it ``sees'' into 20 digital representations, each processed by one chip.
