<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce J. ``Jack'' Roberts</ENAMEX> is so busy making deals that even his bosses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth Corp.</ENAMEX> have trouble reaching him.
Colleagues liken him to a whirling dervish. When he isn't jetting around to scout acquisition prospects, he is usually hunkered down with his staff in the secure ``war room'' at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> headquarters.
``He's always in the war room. To get him, you have to know his beeper number,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger W. Hale</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX> unit executive. ``His pager is going off every 15 to 20 seconds because no one can reach him in the office.''
Recently, the pager has been working overtime. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> was architect and key negotiator of the agreement earlier this month to merge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX>'s cellular properties with those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN Broadcasting Inc.</ENAMEX>, a transaction Wall Street hails as a ``win-win'' for shareholders. It would create the nation's No. 2 cellular concern and one positioned to dominate the market, with 46 million potential customers.
``In terms of planning and strategy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> was the quarterback on the deal,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William O. Mccoy</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth Enterprises.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald A. Pels</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive, says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> came up with a ``very creative idea'' and was persistent in getting both sides to embrace it, despite resistance on plenty of issues. ``My hat's off to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pels</ENAMEX>, who calls the transaction ``unusally imaginative for a company of that size.''
The brash outsider was hired five years ago to help transform a plodding bureacracy into a force able to compete in unregulated markets following the breakup of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell System</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>, 43, vice president for corporate development at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth Enterprises</ENAMEX>, the company's unregulated businesses unit, quickly made his presence known. ``I can't think of a single meeting where there haven't been sparks,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hale</ENAMEX> says. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>'s reaction to those favoring prolonged discussion, he says, is likely to be: ``Damn it, let's stop thinking about it and go do it.'' Adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Huntz</ENAMEX>, managing partner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noble Ventures International</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>: ``He's not lacking in ego. He lets you know that he thinks highly of himself and what he's doing. He's terribly aggressive and extremely diligent.''
Although some of his colleagues might consider him abrasive, few would argue that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> hasn't produced results -- a string of deals expanding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX>'s cellular, paging and Yellow Pages businesses. For example, he was instrumental in the acquisitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobile Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> in 1988 and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L.M. Berry & Co.</ENAMEX> Yellow Pages advertising sales concern in 1986.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> ``is in constant motion and works extreme hours, long into the night. He has three or four deals working, one pending and one in the vision somewhere,'' says his former boss, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hale</ENAMEX>, who is now president and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisville Gas & Electric Co.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>, whom friends describe as a workaholic, acknowledges he might be driving himself a bit hard. He used to enjoy guitar duets with a close friend and former business partner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Mitchell</ENAMEX>, who died in May. At the funeral, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> recalled that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>, shortly before his death, cautioned ``there are more important things in life than working your head off'' and that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> should learn to ``slow down.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> remarked that he wasn't following the advice, but ``I hope to be able to one day.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>, who spent eight years as an independent consultant, was hired in 1984 after assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX> on several small acquisitions. Though his admirers attribute his success to the force of his ideas and his persuasive powers, the strong backing of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccoy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John L. Clendenin</ENAMEX> hasn't hurt.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> first proposed the complex LIN merger more than a year ago in informal discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Plouf</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> ``kept us thinking about the deal'' and then seized the opportunity to push it aggressively in early August, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX> finally rejected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaw Cellular Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>'s tender offer, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pels</ENAMEX> says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>'s merger proposal substantially increases shareholder values, without a costly acquisition that would dilute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX>'s earnings and without tampering with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LIN</ENAMEX>'s proven ability to generate profits, analysts say. ``This adds a little sex appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellsouth</ENAMEX>,'' says analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Grubman</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>.
Once Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> has identified his quarry, he can be relentless in negotiations. ``He sees what motivates everyone involved and is very good at designing a transaction that gives everyone what they want,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investment banker who has worked with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX>. ``He is a breath of fresh air in his ability to cut through nonsense.''
During marathon negotiations on giant transactions, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberts</ENAMEX> has been known to break the ice with southern homilies such as, ``That dog won't hunt.''
``He tries to cover up the fact he is a very smart, tenacious guy with a sort of'aw  shucks' country boy demeanor,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Welsh</ENAMEX>, managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential-Bache Capital Funding</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``Some people are disarmed by it, and some people are aggravated by it, but in the end most people respect him a great deal.
