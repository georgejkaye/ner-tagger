<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell Communication Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX> stepped up efforts to sell its Maxwell Graphics commercial printing business after receiving ``a number of inquiries'' from interested parties.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">company</ENAMEX> said it has hired <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investment banker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim Schroder & Co.</ENAMEX> to advise it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell Graphics</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>, was described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell Communication</ENAMEX> as the second-largest commercial printer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. It was pieced together by British media mogul <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maxwell</ENAMEX> in 1986 with the acquisition of four U.S. printing companies. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> said the printing unit, with 15 plants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, had 1988 sales of $726 million.
A source close to the transaction wouldn't estimate the price <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell Graphics</ENAMEX> might fetch, but pointed out that ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> has invested more than $500 million in building the business,'' including the acquisitions.
Earlier this month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> told shareholders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maxwell Communication</ENAMEX> at the annual meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> that he expected to complete the sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> printing operations by the end of March 1990.
Maxwell Graphics prints many major magazines, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> and Sports Illustrated, and Sunday newspaper supplements such as Parade. It also is a major printer of newspaper retail inserts and direct-mail catalogs.
The source close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> said: ``In 1986-87, printing was interesting to {Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX>}. Now he wants to cycle out of it and into other businesses'' such as textbooks, general publishing, and entertainment.
At the shareholders meeting, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> also told shareholders the company was ``close to completing negotiations'' for the purchase of a medium-size educational publisher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. Industry sources in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> said the target likely was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foresman & Co.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX>, and would cost between $400 million and $500 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Kendrick Noble</ENAMEX>, a publishing industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Group</ENAMEX>, said he didn't think Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maxwell</ENAMEX> ``was any less enamored'' of the contract printing business than when he entered it, but in light of his acquisition strategy, he ``probably wants to sell the business ``to finance other things.
