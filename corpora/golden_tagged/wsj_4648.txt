From the headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank</ENAMEX> its president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuniji Miyazaki</ENAMEX>, can look out over the jigsaw streets and sprawl of the world's richest city. There's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> branch in nearly every neighborhood. Each day, some three-quarters of a million people do business at the bank. With $386 billion in total assets, it is the world's largest.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miyazaki</ENAMEX> vividly recalls what a friend at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX>, then the world's largest, said 10 years ago: ``Being large doesn't always bring glory.''
Or oversized profit, either. For a bank that holds more money on deposit than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>'s entire economy generated last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> is far from a dazzling moneymaker. Now it is trying to put profit before size, and American business borrowers are part of the plan. Last week <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> agreed to buy 4.9% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> and 60% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers' CIT Group Inc.</ENAMEX> for a total of $1.4 billion. Most of the money, $1.28 billion, will go for control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX>, a finance and leasing firm.
``It's a bold move on their {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s} part, but it's a catch-up move,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garth Dickey</ENAMEX>, vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ltd.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> subsidiary. ``They haven't been playing a big role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>''
Why not? For most of the past 18 years <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo</ENAMEX> has seemed a lumbering leviathan, obsessed with size and distracted by the long-lived after-effects of the merger that created the bank. ``There is room for improvement,'' says the understated Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miyazaki</ENAMEX>. Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kiyotaka Kano</ENAMEX>, the bank's senior managing director for capital markets: ``I think the merger is completely done now.'' He smiles and adds: ``After the first 15 years, it went quickly.''
Created in October 1971, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank</ENAMEX> -- roughly, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Business Encouragement Bank</ENAMEX>'' -- brought together two of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s most venerable institutions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Kangyo Bank.</ENAMEX> Both were founded in the 19th century to accelerate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s entry into the industrial world. Both also were closely guided by the government; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> was amalgamated into an imperial war bank during World War II.
Each bank had a different style and different clients, and the chemistry in the merged institution was volatile. A cumbersome merger agreement calling for strictly equal treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi and Kangyo</ENAMEX> constituencies made things worse.
For years, branch offices left over from the pre-merger period retained different color schemes, though a spokeswoman says all now have finally  been converted to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo</ENAMEX>'s warm-red color. The personnel division was split into three departments, one for employees hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Bank</ENAMEX>, one for employees hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Kangyo</ENAMEX>, and one for employees hired after the merger.
Today, 62% of the bank's work force has joined since the merger and there is only one personnel department. Yet some personnel managers still look after the affairs of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> hands while others take care of old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Kangyo</ENAMEX> workers.
The bank's presidency and chairmanship alternate between ``D'' men and ``K'' men. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miyazaki</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> alumnus; the less-visible chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ichiro Nakamura</ENAMEX>, comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Kangyo</ENAMEX>. General managers from one of the predecessor banks get two deputies from the other predecessor.
The meticulous balancing has fostered bureaucratic inertia. ``Everything takes twice as long at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKB</ENAMEX>,'' says an analyst at a credit-rating agency. Other bankers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> recall that when shipbuilder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sasebo Heavy Industries Co.</ENAMEX> needed cash in the late 1970s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Kangyo</ENAMEX> veterans wanted to help their old client, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> men favored cutting their losses. The ``K'' men prevailed.
The bank denies any internal haggling over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sasebo</ENAMEX>. But it admits that a tacit agreement once existed to permit each side to continue lending to old customers. Of the customers, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minoru Suzuki</ENAMEX>, manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ginza</ENAMEX> branch, ``Some still want'D ' men or'K' men.''
Loyalties to employees and customers made staff-cutting difficult and hindered the closing of branches. A redundant office stands less than a block from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s biggest branch, in the lobby of its central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> headquarters.
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Brian Waterhouse</ENAMEX>, a securities analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Capel & Co.</ENAMEX>: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo</ENAMEX> is a classic example of how not to merge.''
It hasn't prevented a revival of the urge to merge among other Japanese banks. In August, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taiyo Kobe Bank</ENAMEX>, another merger product from the early 1970s, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui Bank</ENAMEX>, the centerpiece of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> industrial group of companies, disclosed that they plan to join next April into what will become the world's second-largest bank. The motive seems similar to the one behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Kangyo</ENAMEX> merger: to get bigger. Executives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taiyo Kobe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> believe that the advantages of size will outweigh the disadvantages of merging.
Many at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> would agree. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobuya Hagura</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> president, recalls his first International Monetary Fund meeting in 1973, when almost nobody else there had heard of his newly created bank. Ten years later, he relates, ``When I said'Hagura of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKB</ENAMEX>,' they said:'Oh'Oh, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKB</ENAMEX>, the No. 1 bank in the world.' I didn't need to make any presentation at all.''
Bigness has paid off in other ways. Visiting dignitaries drop by to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s leaders. The bank attracts top job-hunters from top universities. At a branch in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, a casual workday morning survey shows that nearly every customer is aware his bank is the world's biggest. A secretary says that is why she banks there.
But keeping retail operations is hardly cost-efficient. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ginza</ENAMEX> branch, manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzuki</ENAMEX> says his 69-person staff handles 3,500 walk-in customers a day, including many who come to participate in bank-sponsored seminars and a few seeking help with problems as diverse as taxes and arranging marriages. Yet two-thirds of those time-consuming customers account for only 5% of his branch's lending profits.
Why keep such business? In large part because the bank hopes to sell its individual customers on high-profit consumer loans and credit cards. ``We believe the greater the number of customers, the greater the prospects for profitability in the future,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suzuki</ENAMEX> says.
Despite its size, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> still trails its rivals in profit. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s second largest bank, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumitomo</ENAMEX>, earns more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>, as do the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Westminster Bank</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s return on shareholder equity, as measured by its operating profit, is next to the lowest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s big commercial banks, at 11.74%, according to calculations by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumitomo</ENAMEX>'s, by contrast, is 20.77%. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daiichi</ENAMEX>'s rate of earnings increases has just begun to outpace its growth in assets. Its fiscal 1989  consolidated net income rose more than 30% from 1988's, to $1.4 billion. Assets rose 16.5%.
To extend their profit gains, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s bankers are looking overseas, to the U.S. in particular.
The merger that created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> took place just as Japanese banks were expanding abroad. The old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Kangyo</ENAMEX> each had obtained Japanese government permission to open American branches. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> was looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nippon Kangyo</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>. The ``D'' men won out. As a concession to the ``K'' men, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> established a small retail bank in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, keeping a 5% interest and placing the remaining ownership with friendly companies.
But other Japanese banks had zeroed in on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, and rapidly expanded their hugely profitable retail banks there. Today, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sumitomo Bank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanwa Bank</ENAMEX> are among the top 10 banks in the state. Not until 1981 was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> able to buy out its partners, for about $25 million, and assume full ownership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank California</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> earlier this year sold its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> retail operations, becoming the first Japanese bank to pull out of a major industrialized market since the war.
None of this has kept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> from lending to corporate America. With about $32 billion in assets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> has one of the largest U.S. portfolios of any foreign bank.
But loans to the largest corporations aren't the most profitable. So the bank has started looking for ways to tap medium-size companies willing to pay higher interest rates than the big multinationals pay. Two years ago the bank experimented by buying a $125 million portfolio of such loans from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Trust Co.</ENAMEX>
Then this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> made their agreement. The planned purchases were characteristically described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> as the ``largest'' U.S. banking investment by a Japanese bank. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> will get more than a bigger parent in the transaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> is one of the world's few banks with a Triple-A credit rating. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DKB</ENAMEX>'s credit standing will lower funding costs and therefore improve profit margins for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIT</ENAMEX> at the same time,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dickey</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities.</ENAMEX> That, he says, will accelerate the payoff to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>.
Yesterday came news of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s move into the U.S. mergers and acquisitions business. Under an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clayton & Dubilier</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> investment firm, the bank will introduce corporate customers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clayton & Dubilier</ENAMEX> to potential buyers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. The bank will also invest as much as $100 million in a leveraged buy-out fund established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clayton & Dubilier</ENAMEX>.
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo</ENAMEX> is waking up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuko Oana</ENAMEX> is the reveille bugler. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX>'s senior managing director in charge of international operations, he likes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S</ENAMEX> and has golfed on 102 American courses. He has been something of an iconoclast at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi Kangyo</ENAMEX>, more interested in performance than size.
``What is important is profitability, or return on assets, not the size of the bank,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oana</ENAMEX> says. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hisao Kobayashi</ENAMEX>, general manager of international planning, adds: ``We don't just want to be a dinosaur in the U.S. We are trying to find a good market niche instead.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oana</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> won't pursue retail banking abroad because it is ``far too costly; there's too much risk in it. I don't want to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> in that area.'' He adds, ``They're excellent. They're too good for us.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leasing</ENAMEX>, real estate and project finance interest Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oana</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> will have to compete for the best business with American and other Japanese banks. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oana</ENAMEX> also wants <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> to be prepared to exploit changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> or Japanese regulations that now restrict banks' securities businesses. To that end, the bank soon plans to open a securities subsidiary in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> to trade U.S. Treasurys.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai-Ichi</ENAMEX> is also seeking expansion opportunities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> market, scheduled to unify in 1992. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oana</ENAMEX> says he hopes to increase revenues from international operations to more than 30% of the bank's total from about 20% now. ``We need to wake up and move ahead; we need a revolution,'' he says.
His boss, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miyazaki</ENAMEX>, is weary of merger trouble. ``For a merger like ours {to really work}, it takes about 30 years in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>,'' he says. ``But the time we're living in doesn't permit us 30 years. We can be patient for 10 years, but not longer.
