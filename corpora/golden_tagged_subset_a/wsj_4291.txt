FRICTION GROWS between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> over the strong dollar.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and his lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mulford</ENAMEX> believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> should lower interest rates, which would make U.S. investments less attractive and bring down the dollar. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> officials say repeatedly that interest-rate policy should focus on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy and inflation, not the dollar.
Greenspan privately chafes at the entire G-7 process for coordinating international economic policies. It was a mistake, he believes, to put so much emphasis on the dollar. And even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> officials who favor lower rates, like Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>, are irritated by what they see as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mulford</ENAMEX>'s high-handed tactics.
Participants in this week's finance-minister meetings say privately that tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> was ``in the air'' throughout discussions of the dollar.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MUBARAK</ENAMEX>'S PLAN puts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> in a box and creates a dilemma for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>.
The Egyptian leader, who meets Bush Monday, is expected to tell him that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> approves <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX>'s U.S.-endorsed plan, which includes a Cairo meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israelis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palestinians</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> mistakenly thought Israeli Defense Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabin</ENAMEX>, who has expressed support for the idea, could get Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX> to go along.
Now, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> pushes too hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mubarak</ENAMEX>'s plan, it could precipitate a political crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>. But backing away from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX>'s plan could damage Arab ties. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Israeli</ENAMEX> Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arens</ENAMEX>, who also meets Bush Monday, will avoid being pinned down on the plan. Instead, he'll complain that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mubarak</ENAMEX>, who wants to play the role of peace broker, refuses to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shamir</ENAMEX>.
HIGH MARKS in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s Cabinet go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheney</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Agriculture</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yeutter</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> aides say the secretary of state got a big dose of credibility with his successful meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>'s defense budget got sliced up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, he's viewed as a ``smart guy'' who may have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX>'s toughest assignment. Yeutter gets top grades for his expertise on a variety of issues.
But conservatives rap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> for his talk of a Democratic-sounding national transportation policy and for refusing to loosen fuel-economy standards. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> aides worry about Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thornburgh</ENAMEX>'s poor press relations. Trade rep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX>, though a policy heavyweight, puts off some with her icy style.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> aides speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>, who's had little impact, may run for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX> retires.
NORIEGA HELPS reduce the U.S. deficit, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> counts as revenue the interest from the escrow account into which U.S. Panama Canal fees are being placed during the struggle to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panamanian</ENAMEX> dictator to quit. Next year's estimated benefit: $23 million. If Noriega holds on through 1994, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> could make $153 million.
IRAN ATTRACTS investment from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> allies, despite American hostility. Finance Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nourbakhsh</ENAMEX> says South Korean and Japanese investors have agreed to pour over $1 billion into industrial projects. He boasts that French officials told him during this week's IMF meeting they won't stand in the way of similar French funding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BAHAMIAN LEADER PINDLING</ENAMEX>, who has filed a libel suit against a report he had drug ties, applauds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s drug plan but warns that success could bring other perils. In recent years, cocaine routes have shifted away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bahamas</ENAMEX>. As the business dwindles, he says, violence has increased as criminals battle for pieces of the shrinking pie and addicts are forced to pay more for a scarcer commodity.
ANIMAL-RIGHTS RULES worry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> and other officials. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Goodwin</ENAMEX>, who directs the nation's drug-abuse research efforts, says complying with the new federal regulations on use of animals in medical research will drain 17% of the money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> research funds. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goodwin</ENAMEX> applauds the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss America</ENAMEX> for stressing the importance of animals in medical research.
DEMOCRATS HOPE to salvage something from their capital gains defeat.
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s plan won, they hope his victory will reinforce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s image as the party of the wealthy. ``Democrats made the valiant fight,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Budget Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX>. ``Now it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>'s issue.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic Party</ENAMEX> leaders talk of extracting a big price from the administration in any future budget or tax deal.
But party divisions linger. Liberal Democrats are impatient with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> leaders, whom they see as too eager for negotiation instead of principled confrontation. ``We ought to let Democrats be Democrats,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montana</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Williams</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicans</ENAMEX> hope to use the Democrats they attracted in the capital gains fight to form other coalitions, notably on next week's child care vote.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gephardt</ENAMEX> begs for patience: ``We haven't been at this very long. Give us a chance.''
MINOR <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MEMOS</ENAMEX>: The Korean education minister warns universities there to restrain students from burning the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> flag. Although it's legal to burn the flag in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, it isn't in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Korea</ENAMEX>.... As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> draws fire for providing inadequate aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, new banners hanging from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> boast, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financing Freedom</ENAMEX> for 200 Years.''... The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, which penalizes firms for tardy annual reports, is about to issue its own -- for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988.
