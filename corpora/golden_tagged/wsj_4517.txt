<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics Corp.</ENAMEX> picked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William A. Anders</ENAMEX>, an aerospace-industry manager and former government official with an eye-popping resume, as its next chairman and chief executive officer.
The former astronaut -- who from 1973 to 1976 also headed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atomic Energy Commission</ENAMEX> and, when it was renamed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ENAMEX> -- will succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley C. Pace</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pace</ENAMEX>, 68 years old, joined a scandal-wracked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> in 1986 and helped calm the turmoil stemming from several government investigations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based defense contractor. Long ago, he signaled his intention to retire.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX>, currently senior executive vice president for operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron Inc.</ENAMEX>, will join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> as vice chairman at the start of the new year and assume the top two posts Jan. 1, 1991.
Analysts said such a timetable should afford an easy transition and give Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX> ample opportunity to familiarize himself with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX>'s diverse products, including various missiles, the M-1 tank, Trident submarine and F-16 fighter.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX> was traveling yesterday, according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX> spokesman, and couldn't be reached for comment.
In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pace</ENAMEX> described his 55-year-old successor as ``quiet and self-confident'' -- the kind of person who doesn't bluster on every subject, but is eager to speak up when he truly has something to offer.
The two men met through an aerospace trade association. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pace</ENAMEX> said that only candidates from inside the company originally were considered to succeed him at the helm, but eventually he was persuaded by the board to look outside as well.
Though Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX> has been at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Textron</ENAMEX> for five years and was a senior executive in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s nuclear energy and aircraft businesses before that, he seems largely unknown on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>.
Nonetheless, his credentials alone enraptured analysts yesterday. ``Is this guy for real?'' asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Cantwell</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wertheim Schroder & Co.</ENAMEX> Besides participating in the first manned flight into deep space -- when Apollo 8 orbited the moon 10 times -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX> also has been an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> test pilot and fighter jock.
He was a backup pilot for Apollo 11, the first lunar landing. After his glory days as an astronaut, he became executive secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Council</ENAMEX> before taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atomic Energy</ENAMEX> seat. He served as U.S. ambassador to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norway</ENAMEX> in 1976 and 1977.
Colleagues described Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX> as a straightforward, no-nonsense leader who believes in a team approach to get things accomplished. ``He's very intense, very logical,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Lovell</ENAMEX>, who flew with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX> on Apollo 8.
All told, it seems, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX> should have little trouble maintaining the clean-cut image Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pace</ENAMEX> has fostered since his arrival at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRW Inc.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pace</ENAMEX> was brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> after numerous contretemps, including a headline-grabbing episode in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Dynamics</ENAMEX> billed the government for an executive's dog kennel fees. Then-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lehman</ENAMEX> characterized the corporation's philosophy as ``catch us if you can.'' Though no convictions resulted, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David S. Lewis</ENAMEX> was ousted as chief executive.
Today, there are entirely new challenges. The biggest one, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pace</ENAMEX> said, may be in bringing along the programs in which the company has invested heavily in recent years. Among them: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s A12 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Tactical Aircraft</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Tactical Fighter</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aerospace Plane.</ENAMEX>
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anders</ENAMEX>, given his experience in the nation's capital, could be an ideal choice to take on such a task. ``I was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> for six years, and I'm still alive,'' he said in a 1986 interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Business.</ENAMEX> ``I've learned how to keep out the way of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machiavelli</ENAMEX>'s knife.''
