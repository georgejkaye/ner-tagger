With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX>, one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this: Is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> staff big enough, and does it have enough clout, to do its job of coordinating foreign policy?
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Scowcroft</ENAMEX>, came into office in January intent on making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been during the Reagan administration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> was a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower Commission</ENAMEX>, which investigated the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>-Contra affair. He was all too aware of how a large, inadequately supervised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s second term.
So, following both the style he pursued as President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ford</ENAMEX>'s national security adviser and the recommendations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower Commission</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> has pruned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely, gathering the views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and intelligence community; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower Commission</ENAMEX> specifically said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff should be ``small'' and warned against letting ``energetic self-starters'' like Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>.
However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> episode has raised questions about whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff is sufficiently big, diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues. During the coup attempt and its aftermath, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staffers were ``stretched very thin,'' says one senior administration official. ``It's a very small shop.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> doesn't plan to increase the staff right now, but is weighing that possibility, the official adds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff ``doesn't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Gaffney</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> aide who now runs the Center for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Policy</ENAMEX>, a conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> think-tank. ``The problem with this administration, I think, is that by design it has greatly diminished, both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense, the role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need, in an increasingly complex world, for a formal system within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and intelligence agencies. By law, the council includes the president, vice president and secretaries of state and defense. In practice, the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members.
But the size, shape and role of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide. That task is one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s perennial problems. In the Bush <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>'s staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987, administration officials say.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> officials insist that the size of the staff wasn't a problem during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> crisis. But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staffer most experienced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Everett Briggs</ENAMEX>, was gone. He had just resigned, at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Aronson</ENAMEX> over the administration's policy on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> and support for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contra</ENAMEX> rebels.
The absence of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Briggs</ENAMEX> underscored the possible inadequacy of the current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> and his deputy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Gates</ENAMEX>, are experts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-Soviet affairs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> is particularly well-versed in arms control, and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gates</ENAMEX> has spent years studying Soviet politics and society. Both have become confidants of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>.
But neither has an extensive background in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. In those areas, the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staffers under them therefore have become more important.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> bureaus. But just as every previous NSC adviser has, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gen. Scowcroft</ENAMEX> now will have to mull at what point the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff becomes too lean and too restrained.
