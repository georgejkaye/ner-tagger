<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maryann Keller</ENAMEX>, a financial analyst who tracks the automobile business, is a well-known, one-woman cottage industry. She works for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investment firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Furman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Selz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dietz & Birney Inc.</ENAMEX> She writes for trade publications, speaks at industry conferences and advises auto executives.
Now Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX> has written ``Rude Awakening: The Rise, Fall, and Struggle for Recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Morrow</ENAMEX>, 275 pages, $19.95). The book is concise and accurate, but also a disappointment. There are no new revelations to reward the reader slogging devotedly through pages of auto-obscuria describing ``transfer-pricing effects of the component divisions'' and ``platform groups.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s recent woes amount to one of the more colossal industrial stumbles in history. The giant's market share has plunged 10 points in five years. As the company rushed into high technology, some of its robots ran amok, and others wouldn't run at all.
So excessively did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger B. Smith</ENAMEX> gasconade the new Saturn subsidiary -- a project using innovative methods to make a small car in the U.s.that it can't possibly meet expectations by the time he drives the first Saturn off the assembly line next year. His acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Data Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> produced the celebrated slugfest with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">billionaire H. Ross Perot</ENAMEX>. More recently, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> managed to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Aircraft Co.</ENAMEX>, a major defense contractor -- just as the defense -- spending cycle was peaking.
Too much of ``Rude Awakening'' consists of broad and familiar themes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> is a stifling bureaucracy; technology should be a means but not an end), backed up by strings of quotes. Some of the talk comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay Chai</ENAMEX>, an executive at the Japanese trading company, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C. Itoh & Co.</ENAMEX>, who served as a key go-between in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> joint venture between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>. The articulate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chai</ENAMEX> happens to be Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX>'s husband, although she doesn't tell the reader that.
A fresher approach might have been to recount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s struggle through the eyes of strategically placed managers and workers caught up in the maelstrom. Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX> does this in a few places, notably the mini-saga of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Haun</ENAMEX>, a central office staffer at the assembly plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Van Nuys</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> He tells graphic tales of labor-management clashes.
Less successful is her description of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Stempel</ENAMEX>, now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s president, fought off hostile superiors to decentralize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX>-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group that he ran after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s 1984 reorganization. This battle of the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Org Chart</ENAMEX>'' might have been enlivened by reconstructing the tense meetings at which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stempel</ENAMEX> wore down his bosses. Instead, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX> merely quotes Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stempel</ENAMEX>'s underlings.
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX> concludes that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>, who retires next June, ``had many of the right ideas, but he seemed unable to implement them in a cohesive way.'' She sizes up the chances of the six executives contending for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s top two jobs next year, but doesn't address the question of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> needs an outsider as its next chairman. Because the company's problems, as described in ``Rude Awakening,'' run so deep, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX>'s thoughts might have been intriguing.
Two industry analysts who seem to believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> needs an outsider are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elmer W. Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira M. Millstein</ENAMEX>, both high-powered corporate lawyers. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> executive until he quit in 1988 after five years of frustration. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millstein</ENAMEX> is outside counsel to a committee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s board.
Each man co-authors parts of ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Business Corporation</ENAMEX>: An Institution in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Transition</ENAMEX>'' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballinger</ENAMEX>, 249 pages, $34.95), a collection of essays on corporate governance edited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John R. Meyer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James M. Gustafson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emory University</ENAMEX>. The book will never make the best-seller list, but it is thoughtprovoking, especially on the subject of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millstein</ENAMEX>'s message: Outside directors must stop being captives to management. ``In their permissive and passive stances,'' he writes in a chapter co-authored with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyer</ENAMEX>, ``most boards are likely (1) not to appraise the performance of Ceos critically enough; (2) to overestimate the ability of managers to manage different kinds of businesses well; (3) to allow managers to build enterprises that may be too large and diversified for anyone to manage well; and (4) to wait too long to respond to ongoing political, social and economic change.''
Both authors propose that corporate boards be chaired by an outside director who prepares ``his or her own agenda for the meeting, in close consultation with the CEO, management and fellow directors.'' Might <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s woes have been eased had the company's outside directors followed their own lawyer's advice?
In a separate chapter, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Messrs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gustafson</ENAMEX> quote from a moving letter written in July 1987 by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> hourly worker, to a high-school classmate who is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> manager:
``Knowing that I never had a chance to be anything within the company,'' the worker wrote, ``the next obvious move was for me to become active in the local union, and I did. I now had a cause... to screw the sons of bitches in management that had been too good to recognize me as another human being.... I picked on bad management people and good management people. It made no difference.''
The worker then described his conversion to the cause of cooperation after realizing the animosities were taking GM right down the tubes: ``We have to truly change if we are to survive. We have to care about the consumer. We have to care about the stockholders. We have to care about the people we represent. But most important, management people and workers have to care about each other...''
It is ironic to think that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>, which lurched from one grand strategy to another for most of this decade, basic human relations might take the company back on the path to prosperity.
