<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Beck</ENAMEX>, 55 years old, was named vice chairman, a new position at this financial-services concern. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Cole</ENAMEX>, president and chief executive officer, said he expects Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beck</ENAMEX> will be nominated at a later date to the boards of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Capital</ENAMEX> and some of its subsidiaries. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beck</ENAMEX> recently resigned as chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ontario Securities Commission</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swire Pacific Ltd.</ENAMEX>, already one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s biggest companies, is investing more money in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> real estate.
Executives of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swire</ENAMEX>'s wholly owned real-estate operation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swire Properties Ltd.</ENAMEX>, outlined a plan to invest about HK$2 billion (US$256.3 million) in two projects in the eastern district of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> island. The plan represents the company's first big move since the June 4 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> student massacre undermined confidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s property sector.
One project involves spending more than HK$800 million to build two office towers; the other calls for spending over HK$1 billion to redevelop factories into office and industrial space.
But analysts don't see the announcement as a major sign of confidence in the colony, which is due to revert to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s control in 1997. They said the near-certain profitability of the projects means the company is risking little.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> said its supervisory board approved the company's plans to buy a total of 42 jets over the next seven years, including the purchase of 20 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Airbus Industrie</ENAMEX> A-321 jets and options on another 20 Airbus jets. The West German national air carrier also said it was converting options for an A-300-600 jet and an A-310-300 jet as well as options for six <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737-300 jets and 14 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737-500 jets into firm orders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX>'s fleet, now 163 aircraft, will rise to 227 in 1996.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> partners gave it six months to close down the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bagnoli</ENAMEX> steel plant near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Naples</ENAMEX>; failing that, the case will go to the European court of justice. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX> had first set a deadline in June this year for closing the plant, but the Italian government wanted a one-year postponement. The closing or sale of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bagnoli</ENAMEX> plant and three other steel mills, which are owned by the Italian government, was the condition set by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> for allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> to pay part of the companies' huge debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s steel restructuring is expected to cut a total of 20,000 jobs and reduce production by 1.2 million tons.
The high price of consumer goods in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> prevents residents from enjoying the living standards their hefty incomes should provide, concludes a report by a Japanese government agency.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Economic Planning Agency</ENAMEX> report, based on a comparison between prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, found goods and services in the Japanese capital cost an average 39% more than in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and 47% more than in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX>. The cost of rents and government-subsidized food products average twice as much in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> as in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, the report said.
The report blamed several aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s economic structure, including government barriers against food imports such as rice, for adding to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>'s high cost of living. Other factors were antiquated distribution networks, in which a labyrinth of middlemen take a cut, and add-on services in retailing, such as elaborate packaging of goods.
But the report did have some bright news: Some goods and services, including health care, education and dry cleaning, were found to be cheaper in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> than in the two Western cities.
Dutch researchers said they've found a way to more than double the success rate for test-tube fertilization.
