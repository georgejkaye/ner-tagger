Might the government take the wind out of the whistle-blowers' act?
The False Claims Act, as it's officially known, includes provisions allowing private citizens to bring civil suits on behalf of the government. They're based on a principle called qui tam -- Latin shorthand for ``he who sues for the king as well as for himself.'' But what if the king, in this case the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, decides the extra help is a royal pain?
In essence, that's the defense industry's best hope to turn back a wave of fraud cases being filed under the statute. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> contractors have attacked the act on constitutional grounds, but they've lost all three federal court rulings on the matter to date. Now, they are looking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, where an internal debate has been brewing over whether the qui tam provisions undermine the department's authority.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> formally opposes the whistle-blower provisions, ``it could have a profound effect'' on how a judge would rule in such cases, asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Fenster</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> defense attorney who represents some of the nation's biggest military concerns.
So far, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> officials haven't taken a public position, and as far as pending cases go, that's as good as saying they have no problem with where things stand. Nonetheless, sentiment against the provisions -- at least in their current form -- continues to swell within the top ranks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>. ``There is a fair degree of unanimity that there are serious'' constitutional objections to the provisions within the department, says one high-ranking government official.
At this point, defense-industry lawyers and plaintiffs' attorneys are hoping to sway <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> opinion. Both have met with Solicitor General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Starr</ENAMEX>, who represents the government before appellate courts. It's unclear what view Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starr</ENAMEX> may take on the issue. The False Claims Act is the result of Civil War-era contractors cheating the government, often supplying dying donkeys or faulty firearms. Signed into law by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lincoln</ENAMEX> in 1863, it has proved a valuable tool in the government's continuing fight against malfeasant contractors.
The qui tam provisions work like this: A citizen, believing that a government contractor has committed fraud, files suit on behalf of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> and then notifies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> he has done so. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justice</ENAMEX>, in turn, has 60 days to decide if it wants to join the case while the suit is kept under seal. Either way, the whistle-blower shares in any monetary recovery.
Much of the sentiment against the act stems from amendments made in 1986 that have encouraged more private citizens -- usually company employees -- to sue. Among other things, these changes allow whistle-blowers to remain parties to suits even after the government intervenes. They also increase the percentage of the recovery whistle-blowers can keep in such cases to between 15% and 25% from 10%.
In the past three years, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> has intervened in 27 such suits and has declined to enter 67; another 87 cases are awaiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>'s decision on whether to join. Meanwhile, more than $25 million already has been added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> as a result of these complaints. The statute ``has proven to be a cheap, effective remedy against government contracting fraud,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Voorhes</ENAMEX>, a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business</ENAMEX> Executives for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>, a military preparedness advocacy group.
The growing number of suits brought under the act has the defense lobby quaking. ``We still don't know whether what we've seen is just the beginning of the wave,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leroy Haugh</ENAMEX>, a vice president at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospace Industries Association</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> trade group. He complains that even ill-founded False Claims suits ``taint the whole industry,'' not to mention waste company time and resources.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justice</ENAMEX> has its own worries. In particular, department attorneys say conflicts between private plaintiffs and the government can arise. The government, for instance, may choose to settle a case for a certain amount, but the citizen may want more or insist upon going to trial. Or a whistle-blower may demand documents from a defense contractor, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> demurs in the name of national security.
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> doesn't intervene in these suits, other questions are raised. Does the act clash with the Constitution's separation-of-powers doctrine by improperly delegating prosecutorial functions to private citizens? Does a whistle-blower who isn't claiming personal injury have legal standing to sue on behalf of all U.S. taxpayers?
Though there is intense congressional pressure not to oppose the statute, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> officials in the civil division have advocated altering the qui tam provisions to inhibit private citizens from bringing suit when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> doesn't intervene.
``The government's interests should be protected by public officials, not by self-appointed and self-interested private parties who have suffered no injury at all,'' asserts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Gewirtz</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yale</ENAMEX> law professor who has submitted papers supporting the contractors to the courts.
To this point, though, they have ruled otherwise. ``There is no case-law for the claim that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> may not authorize private persons to engage in conduct that might also be the province of government,'' U.S. District Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert P. Aguilar</ENAMEX> wrote in a June opinion involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Corp.</ENAMEX>
Lawyers who bring False Claims cases maintain that the constitutional wrangling is merely a ploy by the contractors to avoid facing the meat of these cases: whether or not they've bilked the government. To even talk about constitutionality ``dignifies their argument too much,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Phillips</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> attorney who helped draft the act's 1986 amendments.
Attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herbert Hafif</ENAMEX>, who has pursued False Claims cases against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Corp.</ENAMEX> for alleged fraud on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MX</ENAMEX> missile parts, the air-launched cruise missile and the B-2 Stealth bomber, says: ``The amendments passed Congress and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> signed them and nobody questioned the constitutionality then. Now, all of a sudden, you find these misguided attacks repeated over and over. {The constitutionality question} is a mythological problem.
