Two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX> researchers said an Italian drug is to be tested soon as a means of suppressing the AIDS virus.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonore Herzenberg</ENAMEX>, a husband-and-wife team of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> geneticists, speculate that the drug, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-acetylcysteine</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX>, made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zambon Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>, may counteract the virus-boosting effects of the tumor-necrosis factor, or TNF. A naturally occuring protein, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TNF</ENAMEX> is believed to activate the AIDS virus, and to cause the cachexia or wasting associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Currently, the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> is used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> as an antidote for overdoses of acetominophen, or Tylenol. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, it is used to treat bronchitis.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonore Herzenberg</ENAMEX> said the drug is slated for a ``community-based trial,'' run by practicing doctors rather than the research establishment; she declined to identify who the trial organizers would be.
Amid the wild acclamation sometimes given the AIDS drug fads, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herzenberg</ENAMEX> urged patients not to rush into self-experimentation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX>.
``We hope things won't go crazy,'' she said. ``This is a lab result. We don't know if it works in humans. It works in the test tube.''
But even while asserting test-tube efficacy, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herzenberg</ENAMEX> acknowledged that the researchers hadn't, in fact, tested NAC against live AIDS virus. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAC</ENAMEX> was tested in a simulation that combined kidney cells and AIDS virus genes. Other reseachers question the validity of this screening system.
