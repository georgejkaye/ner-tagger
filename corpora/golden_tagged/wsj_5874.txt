This British colony is finding it ever harder to retain its best and brightest people as the date for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s return to Chinese sovereignty draws nearer.
The number of people leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> will rise 31% next year to 55,000 from 42,000 this year, according to projections by a goverment task force on emigration. A statistical profile of those who have left so far underlines the impressions of business executives and politicians that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> is experiencing a ``brain drain'' of young, educated middle managers and professionals.
In 1987, the number of emigrants rose 58% from a year earlier to 30,000 people, according to goverment figures. Last year, the number of emigrants rose 53%, to 45,800. The projected figure of 42,000 for this year would represent a slight slowing despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> massacre on June 4, which has heightened fears that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> won't keep its promises of maintaining <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s freedoms and its capitalist economic system after the colony's planned [1997 return] to Chinese sovereignty.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government says the effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> massacre won't be seen in 1989's final emigration numbers because of the time it takes for applications to be filed, processed and acted upon. Nevertheless, many private analysts are skeptical that fewer people are leaving this year.
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, thousands of prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> emigrants have flooded the consulates of the three most popular destinations -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> -- seeking visa applications. A new resident visa program announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> attracted 20,000 potential applicants on its first day.
However, the government cautioned against assuming that all those who have sought visa applications in recent weeks would actually emigrate or would be qualified to emigrate. It also said that the immigration quotas of the destination countries would ultimately determine how many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> people can leave and how quickly.
Because of these overseas limitations, the government predicts that the number of emigrants will settle into a range of 55,000 to 60,000 annually for the next few years. Still, that would be three times the 20,000-a-year average of the early 1980s.
Emigration from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> jumped in 1987, partly because of growing nervousness over 1997 and partly because of increased opportunities to emigrate to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>. Both countries have been seeking entrepreneurs and skilled workers.
Although businessmen and local politicians began complaining about a brain drain of managers and professionals in 1987, the government at first tried to minimize the emigration issue by saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> people traditionally have been mobile. A large part of the colony's 5.7 million population consists of refugees from Chinese communism.
However, faced with mounting evidence that emigration was accelerating because of worries about 1997, the government in May 1988 established the emigration task force to study the issue. In announcing the task force's findings to date on Friday, the government repeated that it wouldn't restrict freedom of movement from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and said that the Sino-British agreement on the return of the colony to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> also guarantees freedom of movement.
Although a number of Southeast Asian and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> countries have announced plans for investment-linked resident visas or passports, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> government officials said their research shows that 90% of the emigrants to date have gone to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
The brain drain is also borne out in the the government's study of those who have left. For instance, ``disproportionately more'' emigrants are in the 25-to-44 age group than the population at large, the government says.
Also, the emigrants are better educated than the general population. In 1987, 5,600 people, or 18.7% of total emigrants, held college degrees. In 1988, 6,900, or 15% of total emigrants, held college degrees. Only 3.5% of the general population hold degrees.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furthermore</ENAMEX>, many of the emigrants are managers and professionals. Of the 30,000 emigrants in 1987, some 7,400, or 25% of the total, were in the ``professional, technical, administrative and managerial'' categories of the work force. Of the 45,800 emigrants in 1988, 11,200, or 24% of the total, were in this category. (About 11% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s work force is categorized as professional, technical, administrative or managerial.)
Although emigration-related turnover of staff has caused trouble for individual companies, the government hasn't been able to calculate the cost of emigration to the overall economy.
In announcing the statistics, government spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Rowse</ENAMEX> said the projections for the 1990s take into account local reaction to the June 4 massacre. He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> companies have so far been able to replace those leaving by stepping up training programs and promoting from within. In some cases, expatriates are being brought in, though more may be needed. And there is a still a flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> people with new passports coming back to the colony, he said, adding that it was hard determine exactly how many.
On the other hand, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowse</ENAMEX> said, emigration is ``doing damage by the loss of talent and doing damage indirectly to the morale of people left behind.''
He said that the government projections take into account the new <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> visa package, which could allow up to 100,000 people to emigrate over the next decade. He also said it includes the possibility that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> may raise its annual visa quota for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> as high as 10,000 people from 5,000 currently.
But he said it was difficult to factor in recent promises by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> to devise an emigration ``insurance'' package for at least part of the population if conditions sour after 1997. ``The whole idea is to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> people here and keep <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> successful, not to have them go and live on the other side of the world,'' he said. About 1,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> residents a year emigrate to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>. (People born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, though they carry passports issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, don't have the right to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>.)
After the June 4 massacre, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> pressure groups stepped up efforts to lobby British lawmakers and win back the right of abode, which was lost through a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British nationality</ENAMEX> acts since World War II. However, with both the British government and a wide range of opposition politicians lined up against the issue, it is unlikely to succeed.
By virtue of birth and other criteria, about 3.3 million <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> people would qualify for right of abode in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, but British politicians have said such a number of immigrants would overwhelm British social services.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowse</ENAMEX> called on British lawmakers to consider the right of abode ``as an issue of principle rather than one of Asian immigration.
