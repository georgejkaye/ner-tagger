<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEARS</ENAMEX> FADE on the economy, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX> poll shows.
Of those polled, 85% expect their family's financial situation to either stay the same or get better over the next year. Only 13% expect their finances to worsen. That reinforces the latest view of most economists that a recession isn't likely in the next 12 months. With the economy showing unexpected vigor, says economist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Roach</ENAMEX>, ``it seems likely the momentum could spill over into 1990.''
But a majority of people surveyed believe the budget deficit and federal taxes will go up. And 43% say inflation will accelerate; only 8% think it will fall. Budget and trade deficits as well as unemployment outrank interest rates as economic concerns.
Analysts say many Eastern manufacturers fear a strong dollar will slow U.S. factory exports in the coming year.
UNCERTAINTY REIGNS over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Europe</ENAMEX> among the public and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> advisers.
Views are evenly split on whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> should actively encourage Iron Curtain nations to loosen ties with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ/NBC</ENAMEX> poll shows. U.S. officials move cautiously. Prodded by Democratic charges of inaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> will tell the Soviets' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shevardnadze</ENAMEX> at their Wyoming meeting starting today that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> plans modest help for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>.
The administration will allow the two nations to increase steel shipments to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> It also urges <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to approve a $100 million fund in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and $25 million in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> to foster private enterprise. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> might be next in line'' for reform, a senior U.S. official predicts.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BUSH</ENAMEX> SOARS in approval ratings, but Democrats see underlying weaknesses.
An impressive 67% in the new poll say they approve of the job the president is doing. More than 60% approve of his handling the economy, and 58% applaud him on foreign affairs. Most heartening to GOP partisans: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> does best among young voters. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s first blush of popularity seems to be lasting well beyond the honeymoon stage.
But Democrats say the numbers are soft. If Bush hits any big bumps, ``he's going to be in trouble quickly because he's essentially a caretaker,'' contends Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Committee</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Mccurry</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> official counters: ``The poll numbers are a mile wide and a mile deep because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> has delivered on his campaign promises.''
Democrats concede that the party's new leadership has trouble devising a strategy for challenging the president.
THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GIPPER</ENAMEX> LOSES ONE in the poll. Asked whom they like better as president, 48% go with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>; only 22% choose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>. Among blacks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is preferred by an overwhelming 48% to 9%. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, in general, has a 53% to 24% favorable rating among black voters.
PRO-CHOICE CANDIDATES fare the best among voters. Some 46% of those surveyed said they would definitely vote, or would be more likely to vote, for the candidate who favors a woman's right to an abortion. Some 28% said they would back an anti-abortion candidate. Young voters are pro-choice by a more lopsided 2 to 1.
Iras RULE over cutting the capital-gains tax; in the poll, 49% of voters say they prefer expansion of tax-deductible individual retirement accounts pushed by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bentsen</ENAMEX> and other Democrats, while 38% back capital-gains tax cuts advocated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>. Among middle-income voters, the Iras advantage widens to 53% to 35%.
SOCIAL ISSUES dominate public opinion. Drugs are by far the top worry in the poll. The budget deficit is a distant second, but the next biggest concerns are the homeless, education and the environment. War and peace, high taxes and trade are cited by only 1% each as the most important issue facing the country.
ETHICS SCANDALS don't lower public opinion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and Democrats.
The new poll shows little impact from the furor over former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> and others. A solid 74% of voters say ethics in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> are about the same as in the past but are just getting more attention now. And 70% believe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is doing about the same quality job as most recent Congresses. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s Democratic majority isn't damaged by the flaps. In the poll, slightly more voters, 32% to 29%, say they plan to vote for the Democratic candidate in the 1990 congressional election. GOP Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX> says voters' wide interests aren't reflected in what she calls the media's ``bikini treatment: skimpy coverage that calls attention to the most sensational parts.''
Sentiment grows that Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> ultimately will leave for political and personal reasons.
MINOR <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MEMOS</ENAMEX>: The Silver Fox jumps high above <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy Reagan</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WSJ/NBC</ENAMEX> poll: voters like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Bush</ENAMEX> better than her predecessor by 58% to 19%. Among women, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wins 66% to 15%.... Duke who? Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dukakis</ENAMEX> got 46% of the vote in losing last year's presidential election, only 33% of those polled say they voted for him.... The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pete</ENAMEX> Rose Memorial Question: Asked if they plan to bet on baseball playoff games or football over the next month, 20% of those polled say yes.
