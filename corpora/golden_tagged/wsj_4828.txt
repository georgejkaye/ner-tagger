In the year-ago quarter, the independent oil and gas producer had net income of $2 million, or two cents a share, on revenue of $316 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oryx</ENAMEX>, formerly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Exploration & Production Co.</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Co.</ENAMEX>, was spun off on Nov. 1, 1988.
Under the pact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oryx</ENAMEX> sold its interests in about 107 oil and gas fields in 12 states to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Exploration Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.

Proceeds will be used for investments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oryx</ENAMEX> said.
