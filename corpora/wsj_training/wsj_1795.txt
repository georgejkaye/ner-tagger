The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX> is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes, for two reasons.
First, its position in the government is anomalous. It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government's instruments -- the control of the money supply. Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic. Second, the responsibilities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> as guardian of the currency, which means as guardian of the stability of the price level, sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular. As former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Mcchesney Martin</ENAMEX> used to say, they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting.
So the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> is an attractive target for complaint by politicians. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness, like high interest rates or slow economic growth, while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s independence.
This leads to proposals for ``reform'' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>, which have the common feature of making the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> more responsive to the administration, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and to public opinion -- without, however, any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians. These proposals include changing the term of the chairman, shortening the terms of the members, eliminating the presidents of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> Banks from the decision-making process, putting the Secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX>, having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> audited by an arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX>), putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s expenditures in the budget, and requiring prompt publication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s minutes. Some of these ideas are again under consideration in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s problem is or, if they do, they rest on an incorrect view. They would not solve the problem; they would make it worse. The problem is not that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> is too unresponsive to the public interest. On the contrary, it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest.
The price level in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> is now about 4 1/4 times as high as it was 30 years ago. On average, something that cost $100 30 years ago now costs $425. Or, a wage that was $100 30 years ago would buy only $23.53 worth of stuff today. On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10% a year. In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession -- the two worst of the postwar period.
The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy. At least, it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period. And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>.
The basic problem of monetary policy, to which reform of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> should be addressed, is to prevent a recurrence of this experience.
There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years:
1. To some extent the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output.
2. Even where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it. Despite all the formal provisions for its independence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it.
The common proposals for reforming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> would only make the situation worse, if they had any effect at all. Putting the Secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Governors</ENAMEX>, one of the leading proposals today, is an example. The secretary is the world's biggest borrower of money. He has a built-in, constant longing for lower interest rates. Moreover, he is a political agent of a political president, who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election, and less to its longer-run health. These days, the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be, which is a diversion from the real business of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> to stabilize the price level.
How should a reasonable member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve Board</ENAMEX> interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board? Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level? Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents -- low interest rates, short-run economic expansion, and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels? The answer seems perfectly clear.
(True, a succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> belongs on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>. By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew, in which case it is natural that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, and probably also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government.)
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s problem is not that it is too independent, or too unpolitical. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> is responsive to, and can not help being responsive to, the more overtly political part of the government. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> exercises a power given to it by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the president. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>.
Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic. What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy, which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level. To leave this decision to an ``independent'' agency is not only undemocratic. It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale, because it leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> guessing about what are the expectations of its masters, the politicians, who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy.
The greatest contribution <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX>. Legislation to this effect has been introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in this session by Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Neal</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>). It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted, however. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would be required to make a hard decision, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> and retain its rights of complaint after the fact.
People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives, in addition to stabilizing the price level, which is true. But that is not the same as saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> has other objectives. The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives. But it has only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> to pursue price-level stability. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level.
The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> are high employment and rapid real growth. But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals, the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation.
