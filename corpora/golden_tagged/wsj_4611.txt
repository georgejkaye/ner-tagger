<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Service Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> said a number of financial uncertainties led it to withdraw its offer to buy the generation, transmission and related assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>-Ute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electric Association</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>, an investor-owned utility, said the acquisition plan was withdrawn primarily ``because it did not appear to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ute</ENAMEX>'s expectations'' and because of some information uncovered during a review of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ute</ENAMEX>'s financial situation and facilities.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> said that specifically the uncertainties and contingent liabilities associated with an experimental power plant, a power plant sale and leaseback plan and other tax liabilities were ``significantly greater'' than it had anticipated. Additionally, the utility said many of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coloradoute</ENAMEX>'s creditors are now less willing to consider debt-restructuring plans than they were some months ago.
