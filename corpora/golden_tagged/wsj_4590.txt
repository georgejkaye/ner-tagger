In another effort to prune skyrocketing costs, the three major television networks and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> are considering a proposal that would consolidate a portion of their political polling operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Mitofsky</ENAMEX>, the executive in charge of polling at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Inc.</ENAMEX>, has sent letters to executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX>, a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Broadcasting Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>, suggesting that a company he would form conduct the polling that enables the networks to make projections on election nights.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> appear close to agreeing to this plan.
So-called exit polling, based on interviews with individuals after they vote, has become ``repetitive'' for the networks, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitofsky</ENAMEX> said. Instead of each network spending ``multimillions of dollars'' on exit polling, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitofsky</ENAMEX> said, they could better allocate their news budgets for analysis of polls. This arrangement wouldn't affect other polls conducted by the networks, often in conjunction with newspapers, that measure the public's attitude toward various issues.
``The talks are pretty far along,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Klette</ENAMEX>, director of election and polling at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC News</ENAMEX>.
An official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX>, who didn't want to be identified, said ``there is no response yet.'' And the political director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Hannon</ENAMEX>, said that although he and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitofsky</ENAMEX> had spoken about the project for several months, he had only received the actual proposal on Monday.
``We have several options before us to hold down costs,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hannon</ENAMEX> said, ``and this is just one of them. We'll make a decision shortly. We're in the middle of our budget process for next year and beyond.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitofsky</ENAMEX> said he would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> and form a private corporation, tentatively titled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitofksy Organization</ENAMEX>, which would conduct the exit polling and projections for any network that wishes to become a client. ``I would charge each network a share of what it costs to conduct a poll,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitofsky</ENAMEX>. ``There would be no repetition in costs between the networks.''
According to a network official who didn't want to be quoted by name, each network temporarily employs as many as 4,000 people to conduct exit polling.
It wasn't long ago that each network prided itself on being the first to project the winner in any election, especially the presidential vote. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Network</ENAMEX> officials repeatedly have testified before Congress about being able to project a winner based on exit polls as soon as the polls close on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> but before voting has stopped on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX>.
``We used to be in the business of being No. 1 with calling races,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klette</ENAMEX>. ``That has stopped. Our ratings on election night last November were not affected by the fact that we were third in calling Bush the winner. Each network calls the race within minutes of one another.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitofsky</ENAMEX> acknowledged that some people might be ``uncomfortable'' having one company supply exit-poll data to more than one network. ``But no one is forcing them to sign up for this,'' he added. ``It just makes economic sense.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitofsky</ENAMEX> said he hopes to have the operation running ``shortly, certainly in time for the 1990 elections.'' There will be about 30 races for governor that year, and a third of the seats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and 435 seats in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Representatives</ENAMEX> will be contested.
``As the networks become more responsible fiscally, this is a good idea,'' said Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klette</ENAMEX>. ``This is the wave of the future.
