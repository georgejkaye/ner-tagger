Mccaw Cellular Communications Inc. must extend its offer for LIN Broadcasting Corp. because it has ``not yet announced committed financing sufficient to complete'' the bid, LIN said in New York.
According to Securities and Exchange Commission rules, Mccaw is required to keep its offer for the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern open for at least five business days after the announcement of the financing, LIN said. Mccaw's offer is scheduled to expire tomorrow.
Last week, Mccaw said it obtained ``firm'' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its bid to control LIN Broadcasting. The banks jointly committed $1.2 billion of financing, subject to certain conditions, Mccaw said.
A spokesman for Mccaw said the company was ``moving forward with our financing.'' He added that ``hopefully LIN will conduct a fair auction.''
Mccaw wants to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $125 each, or $2.75 billion, which would result in Mccaw's owning 50.3% of LIN. The offer is in limbo, however, because LIN has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with Bellsouth Corp.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, LIN rose 50 cents, to $109.25.
