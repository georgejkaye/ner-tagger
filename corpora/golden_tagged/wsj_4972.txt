<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bombay Palace Restaurants Inc.</ENAMEX> filed under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> was planning to seize its restaurants.
The filing was made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> on behalf of the parent and 52 subsidiaries, about 46 of which are restaurants. The filing excludes certain foreign subsidiaries, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russell W. Rosen</ENAMEX>, corporate counsel and a director at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bombay</ENAMEX> Palace, which operates <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bombay</ENAMEX> Palace and Beefsteak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>'s outlets.
``We couldn't get out from under the taxes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> was on our tail and we had to do something,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> said. Some of the company's problems are market-related, he said, and it has ``heavy debt service,'' some of it tied to the 1987 acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lifestyle Restaurants Inc.</ENAMEX>, which operated Beefsteak <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX>'s restaurants.
Chapter 11 protects a company from lawsuits by its creditors while it works out a plan to pay its debts. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bombay</ENAMEX> Palace is ``taking a hard look, a careful look'' at its operations and will emerge from Chapter 11 a stronger company, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> said. It is too early to speculate on what actions the company might take in reorganizing or on how long it might take to file a plan with the court, he added.
In the filing, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bombay</ENAMEX> Palace says it has current assets of $7.2 million and current liabilities of $20.8 million. The company has nearly 4.6 million shares outstanding, of which about 2.1 million, or 45%, are held by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sant C. Chatwal</ENAMEX>. The shares trade over the counter on the pink sheets. The company has $5.3 million of 8% exchangeable senior debentures and $4.7 million of 13% convertible subordinated debentures outstanding, the filing says.
