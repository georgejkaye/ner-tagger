<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polly Peck International Inc.</ENAMEX>'s agreement to acquire 51% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui Electric Co.</ENAMEX> proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX>, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions. Japanese government officials, eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas, hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asil Nadir</ENAMEX>, echoed the official Japanese view of the accord, which was announced Friday.
``The myths that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is not open to concerns from outside has, I think, been demolished at a stroke,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir</ENAMEX> said.
But analysts say Sansui is a special case. It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen. ``If you find sound, healthy companies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, they are not for sale,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Watanabe</ENAMEX>, a management-consultant at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Advisory Services Inc.</ENAMEX>
Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>, which is listed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Osaka</ENAMEX> stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held. But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies.
Nor do analysts expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases. If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers.
Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>'s directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> was once one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles.
But in recent years, the market has moved toward less expensive ``mini-component'' sets, miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other.
Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>'s fellow audio-specialty companies, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aiwa Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer Electric Corp.</ENAMEX>, responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own, by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX> was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses.
As the yen soared in recent years, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>'s deepening financial problems became a vicious circle. While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>. ``Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with'' changes in the marketplace, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryosuke Ito</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>'s president.
But even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshihisa Murasawa</ENAMEX>, a management consultant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Booz-Allen & Hamilton (Japan) Inc.</ENAMEX>, said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future. ``Attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative, but they're becoming more positive,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murasawa</ENAMEX> said. ``In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make sense.''
Whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX>'s acquisition makes sense remains to be seen, but at the news conference, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir</ENAMEX> brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>, he said, is a perfect fit for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX>'s electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an ``original equipment maker'' basis for sale under other companies' brand names.
He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> will greatly expand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>'s product line, using <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>'s engineers to design the new products, and will move <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>'s production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX>'s own factories.
``Whatever capital it (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir</ENAMEX> said.
And while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> isn't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sansui</ENAMEX>, it is bringing in a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toshiba Corp.</ENAMEX> executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer.
Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nadir</ENAMEX>, who is 25% owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> as well as its chairman. He took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX>, once a small fabric wholesaler, and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980. In September, it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Del Monte</ENAMEX> foods unit for # 557 million ($878 million).
Last month, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Polly Peck</ENAMEX> posted a 38% jump in pretax profit for the first half to # 54.8 million from # 39.8 million on a 63% rise in sales.
