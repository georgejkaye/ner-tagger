And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> audit.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie Jackson</ENAMEX>, the retired baseball star, has found another use for them. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, who won the nickname ``Mr. October'' for his World Series exploits, is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $500 each.
Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>'s canceled checks is unusual. ``I don't know of any living ballplayer that's ever done it,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Smalling</ENAMEX>, a dealer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ames</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>, and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs.
An initial batch of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>'s checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> over Labor Day weekend. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well.
``For someone who has everything else -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie</ENAMEX>'s jersey, cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Vizas</ENAMEX>, owner of Bill's Sports Collectibles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX>, who examined the checks at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> card show.
For years, the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold. But these players were dead. ``Maybe three years ago, there were a lot of {<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ty} Cobbs</ENAMEX> in the hobby, and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX>.
However, the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way. ``Maybe I'm a little stuffy, but I wouldn't sell them,'' sniffs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Machon</ENAMEX>, owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Papa</ENAMEX>'s Sports Cards in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Menlo Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX> ``Who knows how much they'll be worth 100 years from now?''
And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX> doesn't believe they're worth all that much now. ``I don't think the checks are worth $15 apiece,'' he says.
Why Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>, who couldn't be reached for comment, has made some of his checks available for sale isn't clear. He probably hasn't done it for the cash.
``I would say he's definitely not in need of money,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Merola</ENAMEX>, an agent of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX>'s based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>. ``He has good investments.''
And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson</ENAMEX> probably has opened new checking accounts, too. Or at least he should. ``I assume those accounts are closed,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smalling</ENAMEX>, referring to the accounts of the canceled checks. ``I don't think he'd want to give out his current account numbers.
