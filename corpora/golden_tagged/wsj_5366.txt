A congressional subcommittee voted to subpoena former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce</ENAMEX>, who abruptly canceled his scheduled appearance last week before the panel investigating allegations of fraud and mismanagement at the agency.
With a series of unanimous roll-call votes yesterday, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Government Operations Employment and Housing</ENAMEX> subcommittee directed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> to appear before it on three separate dates -- next Tuesday, and on Oct. 27 and Nov. 3.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Lantos</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>), chairman of the subcommittee, said the panel ``had no option'' but to order Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s appearance after he canceled his Sept. 15 testimony.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Plotkin</ENAMEX>, one of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s lawyers, said his client will obey the subpoena. ``We definitely will be there Tuesday,'' he said. ``We have a subpoena, and we will obey it.''
Separately, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> released a letter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> that says criminal investigations involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> ``are under way in virtually all the {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice} Department</ENAMEX>'s judicial districts. Eighty-three of the 93 U.S. attorneys have initiated over 700 criminal matters, with the potential to evolve into over 1,000 individual cases.''
Most of the investigations concern alleged fraud in mortgage-insurance and rent-subsidy programs, according to the letter from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Crawford</ENAMEX>, an assistant attorney general for legislative affairs. The letter stated: ``A large number involve investigations of corruption (e.g. bribery or embezzlement) committed by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> employees who administered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> funds or by local officials who were in receipt of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> grants.''
Subcommittee members had been critical of the slow pace of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s criminal investigations, and some panel members have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals. Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> said he hadn't made a decision about the need for a special prosecutor, he indicated that he wasn't satisfied with the information the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> provided in the letter.
``We really are not informed in any meaningful and analytical fashion on what's happening,'' he told reporters after the panel's meeting yesterday.
The former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> secretary voluntarily testified before the subcommittee on May 25. Since then, conflicts have arisen between his statements and the testimony of other witnesses. There also were news accounts indicating that his involvement in certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> projects may have resulted in favored treatment for his associates.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> agreed to testify again on Aug. 3, but according to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX>, asked for a postponement because the former secretary said he had difficulty securing a lawyer. That hearing was rescheduled for last Friday, when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> refused to appear.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s lawyer said yesterday that his client always intended to cooperate with the subcommittee, but needed adequate time to prepare. ``We continue to be concerned that the committee promotes speed over fairness, accuracy and truth,'' he added. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plotkin</ENAMEX> wouldn't say if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and decline to testify.
Voluntary agreements between congressional committees and witnesses ``are not social engagements to be broken at the last minute on a unilateral basis,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> said before the subpoena votes were taken.
Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Weiss</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>), a panel member, accused Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> of ``toying with the subcommittee'' in an attempt to evade his responsibility.
Because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> broke the agreement to appear, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> said he no longer feels bound by an understanding he had with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> about what topics would be covered at the hearing. The earlier agreement was that questioning would be limited to topics discussed in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s May testimony; his role in providing funds for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, housing project for the elderly; and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s decision to lift restrictions on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> co-insurance lender who was represented by former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX>, now the U.S. trade representative.
