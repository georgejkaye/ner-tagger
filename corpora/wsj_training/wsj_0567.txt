A two-day meeting of representatives of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cocom</ENAMEX>, the 17-nation group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries, didn't take any substantive decisions on trimming the list of items under controls. Nor did it ease restrictions on exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, according to U.S. officials who attended the talks.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> had been under pressure from several Cocom members, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>, to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools, which those countries argued were now widely available to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bloc</ENAMEX> countries from non-Cocom members. For several years some European countries have complained that outdated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cocom</ENAMEX> lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security.
Some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> as they move toward more democratic rule, just as special treatment had been agreed on for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. But U.S. officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was ``a matter for further discussion at future meetings.'' They added that ``all of us (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cocom</ENAMEX> members) look at the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> in a positive way, but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study.'' The officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> as a special case, despite the recent repression of dissent there, but to offer no further concessions.
The U.S. officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cocom</ENAMEX> members agreed on ``the continuing need for this organization,'' which was founded 40 years ago at the start of the Cold War. The officials said the meeting agreed to continue working toward ``streamlining'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cocom</ENAMEX>'s restricted products list, and to improve procedures for punishing companies that don't comply with the export restrictions. The officials said this meeting ``put in motion'' procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions, but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter.
