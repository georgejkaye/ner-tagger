<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comdisco Inc.</ENAMEX> said it expects higher earnings for the fourth quarter ending Sept. 30 of $30 million to $32 million, or about 75 cents to 77 cents a share.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rosemont</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, company said revenue should rise to between $410 million and $430 million from $351 million a year earlier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comdisco</ENAMEX> earned $27 million, or 64 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1988.
A spokesman for the company said the strength will come from the re-marketing of its computer portfolio, which consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> mainframe equipment and the equipment of other computer companies.
The spokesman said the secondary market has been ``running at peak levels this year,'' reflecting a stagnant economy. He added that ``it's been a very good year for the used-equipment market,'' making it a ``viable alternative'' to new equipment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comdisco</ENAMEX> stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $32.75 a share in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
