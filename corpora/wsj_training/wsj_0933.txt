(During its centennial year, The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAX SHELTERS</ENAMEX> CALLED Individual Retirement Accounts, or ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iras</ENAMEX>,'' were created without fanfare on Sept. 2, 1974, but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving.
That Labor Day, in his first major act after succeeding the resigned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> as president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald R. Ford</ENAMEX> signed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</ENAMEX>. Pension reform was its main thrust. Labor and business leaders, quoted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> Rose Garden rites, hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits. Iras were like stepchildren there.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX>'s conception is murky. In 1972, then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Shultz</ENAMEX>, with the key support of Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Curtis</ENAMEX>, sought some form of pensions for the uncovered. That year a four-man group headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Lieber</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regulations</ENAMEX> division of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chief Counsel</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX>, was assigned the task of designing a plan.
They used the 1962 Keogh Plan, a pension plan created by a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> congressman for the self-employed, as a partial model. This team initially called its new model <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personal Retirement Account</ENAMEX>, or ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRA.</ENAMEX>'' But it didn't sing. So they opted for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX>, naming it after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira Cohen</ENAMEX>, a brilliant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> actuary who helped them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ira</ENAMEX>, himself, confirms this account.
IRA rules have been changed over the years. One in 1981 raised to $2,000 a year from $1,500 the amount a person could put, tax-deductible, into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans. This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by brokers, banks, mutual funds and others. But in 1986 Congress sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth.
IRA account assets have grown to about $400 billion from $393 billion last year and just $26 billion in 1981.
