Investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asher B. Edelman</ENAMEX>, who bought 30% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint Corp.</ENAMEX>'s stock last week to try to head off a battle for control, purchased most of the shares with funds from another company he controls.
According to filings made with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelogic Trace Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX>, spent almost $15.5 million from working capital and other funds to purchase more than 2.5 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> shares, or about a 25% stake.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> is chairman of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>, a maker of computer products, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelogic Trace</ENAMEX>, a computer services company that was spun off to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> holders in 1985. Previously, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelogic</ENAMEX> owned less than 3% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>.
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filings, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> said he purchased the shares because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin S. Ackerman</ENAMEX> has begun a consent solicitation to replace Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> and the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX> board with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> and his nominees. Because of the purchases, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> and companies he controls now own about 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>.
To succeed in his consent solicitation, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> would have to gather votes of holders of more than 50% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datapoint</ENAMEX>'s shares.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ackerman</ENAMEX> has said he is considering a legal challenge to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX>'s purchases, among other options.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelogic</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company doesn't have any comment beyond the filings. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edelman</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelogic</ENAMEX> officers and directors own 14.5% of the company's stock.
