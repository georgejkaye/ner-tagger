<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s rail-car leasing unit completed the $178.5 million purchase of similar businesses from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucadia National Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brae Corp.</ENAMEX>, 74%-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucadia</ENAMEX>, the sellers said.
The buyer was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE Capital Railcar Services</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, a major owner of railway equipment and part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> Capital operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leucadia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, estimated it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $57 million, including its part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brae</ENAMEX>'s gain. Because of tax-loss carry-forward, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucadia</ENAMEX> said it expects to escape taxes on ``a substantial portion of the gain.''
The estimated gain for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brae</ENAMEX> is $15 million, including a tax credit of $7 million, the sellers said. ``The credit for income taxes is a result of having provided deferred income taxes applicable to the sold assets at the higher income tax rates in effect in prior years,'' the sellers said.
