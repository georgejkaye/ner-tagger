<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> filed a Schedule 13D document with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> regarding its $250 million loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> said in the filing that it obtained collateral security on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s wholly owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.) Inc.</ENAMEX>, its 83.8% indirect interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ralphs Grocery Co.</ENAMEX> and some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s prime Canadian properties. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>) owns all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> properties unit, 100% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Allied</ENAMEX> } and 92.5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated.</ENAMEX> The Canadian assets held as security under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> loan include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s two main <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> office towers -- 50%-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotia</ENAMEX> Plaza and 100%-owned Water -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Park Place</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>, shopping center, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> properties.

In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> filing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campeau</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> to increase its investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> and help the company maintain ``orderly operations'' while pursuing a financial restructuring to reduce its debt. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> said it will select a chief executive officer and chief financial officer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>) who will report directly to a four-member committee of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> directors in charge of the restructuring.
According to the filing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> agreed to modify the terms of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> debt it holds. The maturity date of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX>'s $75 million loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, made last April during a refinancing of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Allied</ENAMEX>, has been pushed back to Sept. 12, 1991, from March 31, 1990. Also, the terms of $260 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> debentures previously purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O&Y</ENAMEX> were amended to subordinate them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> debt held by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward J. Debartolo Corp</ENAMEX>., of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Youngstown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debartolo</ENAMEX> lent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> $480 million during its takeover of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX> last year.
