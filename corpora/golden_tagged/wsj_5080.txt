Concerning your Aug. 28 page-one story ``Park Wars'' about killer whales that perform at theme parks and the increasingly cut-throat competition among theme parks. I found the cavalier attitude toward Shamu very upsetting.
Most people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> were sickened and grieved by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kandu</ENAMEX>'s death and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX>'s apparent malpractice in handling the whales during the entire incident. Many of us are wondering why the press seems to have accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX>'s pat responses to the tragedy. I haven't read a single article that examines whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kandu</ENAMEX> could have lived had the trainers not ignored her injury for 15 minutes.
The most important question is whether animals should be used for human entertainment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shamu</ENAMEX> is not another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Mouse</ENAMEX>. She is a living being, born in captivity and now without the benefit of either a mother or father.
