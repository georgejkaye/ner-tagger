Stock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up $6.07 billion in the latest week, the sharpest increase in almost two years.
The 473 funds tracked by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment Company Institute</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based trade group, rose to $356.1 billion, a record. The $6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988.
The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds. Individual investors, represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories, pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacob Dreyer</ENAMEX>, vice president and chief economist of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute.</ENAMEX>
``Insitutional investors, on the other hand, reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dreyer</ENAMEX> said.
Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donoghue's Money Fund Report</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Holliston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, newsletter. The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55% from 8.60% the week earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donoghue's</ENAMEX> said.
At the auction of six-month <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX> bills on Monday, the average yield fell to 7.61% from 7.82%. Likewise, certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday.
The 142 institutional-type money funds rose $2.23 billion to $85.49 billion. The 235 general-purpose funds increased $2.53 billion to $116.56 billion, while 96 broker-dealer funds increased $1.3 billion to $154.05 billion.
