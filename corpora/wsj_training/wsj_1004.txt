<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> said it agreed to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola Inc.</ENAMEX> participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> semiconductor industry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here, said it invited many other companies to participate as well, including some from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Kuehler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s president, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work, has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally U.S. industry to head off the Japanese, who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Armonk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, makes the bulk of the Drams it uses, it doesn't make the equipment needed to produce those chips. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market, too, unless <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy. Failure of U.S. equipment makers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> fears, would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> already participates in one industrywide effort to improve semiconductor-manufacturing techniques.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive. A state-of-the-art plant cost $40 million in the mid-1970s but costs $500 million today because the technology is so complex. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said it expects the costs to continue climbing.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, which said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> is paying just a nominal fee to cover the 21-month agreement, acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in. But it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> said it thought more companies would become interested as the project progresses.
The project involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motorola</ENAMEX> concerns a technique, called X-ray lithography, that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips.
Currently, chips are produced by shining light through a mask to produce an image on the chip, much as a camera produces an image on film. But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine, and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one. X-rays, by contrast, travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light.
X-rays have problems, too. They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material they're not supposed to. But, assuming those problems can be overcome, they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four-megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s.
