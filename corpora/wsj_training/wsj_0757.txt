Ready, Willing and Unable
I always lift the hood
When my car doesn't start;
If gadgets at home don't work
I coolly take them apart.
I'll admit there's nothing wrong
That I ever do find,
But it's nice when people say
I appear mechanically inclined.

Flick Shock
At the movies today
In detail you see
What the prof wouldn't show
In Physiology Three.

Candid Comment
Don't worry; people will learn to read as long as there are TV program listings.
