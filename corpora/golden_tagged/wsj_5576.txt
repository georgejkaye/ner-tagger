Square <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D Co.</ENAMEX> said it expects third-quarter sales and earnings from continuing operations to be about flat with the year-earlier period.
In the year-earlier quarter, sales from continuing operations were $402.9 million and earnings from continuing operations totaled $1.25 a share, Square D said.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palatine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, maker of electrical and electronic equipment said the ``relatively flat'' results reflect several factors. Square <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D</ENAMEX> said improved performance in industrial markets will be offset by lower earnings from international operations, a lower-than-planned rate of shipments of higher-margin products and the decision to make an initial contribution of $1.4 million to the new Square D employee stock ownership plan.
The company also said it has decided not to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Semiconductor Industries</ENAMEX> subsidiary. After reviewing several bids for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tempe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>-based unit, which makes transient voltage suppressors and systems and high-speed power-switching transistors, Square D said it doesn't believe the bids reflect the value of the business.
Square <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D</ENAMEX> shares closed yesterday at $58.875, off $1.50, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
