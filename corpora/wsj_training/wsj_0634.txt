<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu Inc.</ENAMEX>, the world's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the Japanese market, is setting its sights on overseas expansion.
Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> started HDM, a joint network with U.S. ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocom</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. A few months ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> acquired 69% of Australian agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd.</ENAMEX> for 5.9 million Australian dollars (US$4.6 million). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> has U.S. subsidiaries, but they keep low profiles.
Now, the giant marketing company, which holds 25% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s 4.4 trillion yen ($30.96 billion) advertising industry, is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. What is driving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX>'s international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. ``If we don't do something... we won't be able to catch up with demand,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> spokesman. ``Our president said acquisition is an effective method.''
Last year, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX>'s foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings, but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future. So far, it appears cautious about taking the big step. For example, the spokesman says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi PLC</ENAMEX>. But he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> hasn't looked seriously at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>.
Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines, it is laying the groundwork for international growth. It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad.
For the year ended March 31, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> sales rose 19% to $8.9 billion from $7.5 billion, and net income jumped 59% to $102 million from $64 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX>'s billings last year were larger than those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>, the world's second-largest ad agency, according to a survey by the publication <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advertising Age</ENAMEX>.
But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers. On its own, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX>'s muscle in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-Japanese clients. Thus, an acquisition may prove the necessary course.
But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different. Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice ``that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Warman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s communications division.
Although acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> spokesman. But the different business system would make it hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dentsu</ENAMEX> to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
