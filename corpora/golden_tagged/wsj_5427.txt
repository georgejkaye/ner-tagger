In a bid to attract new investors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data Sciences Inc.</ENAMEX> said its board approved a restructuring plan to split the company into two separately traded concerns.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX>, which produces and markets paperboard, corrugated shipping containers and packaging materials, and makes kitchen cabinets, said it will divide the company into an integrated paper concern and into a diversified industrial holding company which will include its kitchen cabinet operations. The company said it is as yet unclear how much stock in the two new companies current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX> shareholders will receive.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Schoenberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX>'s chairman, said the new paper company has received an oral agreement from an undisclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> private investment group to invest at least $5 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX> said it will sell to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcom Telecommunications Inc.</ENAMEX> its non-paper operations, namely its kitchen cabinet operations, in exchange for an undisclosed amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcom</ENAMEX> stock. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX>, which already owns about 40% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcom</ENAMEX>'s stock, will own ``a substantial majority'' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcom</ENAMEX>'s 10 million common shares outstanding. After the acquisition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcom</ENAMEX> will be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aril Group Inc.</ENAMEX> and its president will be Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schoenberg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marcom</ENAMEX> is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Palm Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX> will then spin off its shares of Aril pro rata to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX>'s shareholders.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX> will remain a paper company operating under the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consolidated Packaging Holdings</ENAMEX>; its shares will be distributed to current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX> holders as well. The company said the restructuring is subject, among other things, to shareholder approval.
In national over-the-counter trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corporate Data</ENAMEX> closed at $6.375, unchanged.
