Japanese officials may be dragging their feet in approving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Globex</ENAMEX>, an electronic futures market being developed jointly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters Holdings PLC</ENAMEX>, following a slow start for a recently launched futures market in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
The issue of a slowdown in the approval process was raised in recent days when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui Trust & Banking Co.</ENAMEX> withdrew its Globex application, futures industry officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> said. Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX>, one of the largest trust banks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, were unavailable to comment on their withdrawal. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Merc</ENAMEX> spokesman said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX> application roster was confidential.
But officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> member firms, who asked not to be named so as not to risk losing business with Japanese institutional customers, speculated that the delay was deliberate. Even though they are confident that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> eventually will approve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX>, they said the Japanese government, in appearing to shield a domestic exchange from foreign competition, is being consistent with its protective stance taken toward other Japanese industries.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX> was designed in part to tap the growing demand in Asian and European markets for trading financial futures contracts outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> trading hours. With its huge pools of investment capital, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> is considered crucial to the long-term success of the planned computerized trading system, which initially will allow traders to buy or sell certain Merc financial futures contracts when the exchange is closed.
A substantial delay in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s approval of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX> would be a blow to the planned system, and could weaken its chance to gain a clear competitive advantage in Asian markets over potential rivals, Merc members said. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX>'s image as the leading innovator among <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> exchanges could also be tarnished if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX>'s expansion is hamstrung for months by Japanese officials. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX> is expected to begin trading on a limited basis in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> by year end or early in 1990, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> officials say. Other futures exchanges in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and abroad are likely to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX> in coming months and eventually list certain of their contracts on the system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> is also negotiating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> to merge Globex with a similar electronic trading system being developed by that exchange.
An official from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX> denied that the government pressured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsui</ENAMEX> or others to back away from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Globex</ENAMEX> following the lackluster launch in June of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange</ENAMEX>, a bank-owned futures market. Except for trading in a Euroyen interest rate futures contract, the fledgling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> exchange has been a disappointment, Japanese futures traders say.
``We have never said no'' to institutions wanting to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX> official said. ``We've just said wait until the system {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX>} becomes clear,'' he said. Japanese regulators are studying Globex, but the official wouldn't say when the study is expected to be completed.
One apparent sticking point in the minds of Japanese officials is who would have authority to investigate trades if trouble develops. ``Who will take responsibility?'' the official asked. ``The problem isn't solved.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merc</ENAMEX> spokesman said the exchange was cooperating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finance Ministry</ENAMEX>'s review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globex</ENAMEX>. ``We have no reason to think things aren't going well,'' he said.
