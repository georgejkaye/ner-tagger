<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX> will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other.
Called Task Broker, the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together. If a machine has a big computing task, Task Broker asks other computers in the network for ``bids'' on the job. It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast.
The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> program, said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mccarthy</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forrester Research Inc.</ENAMEX>, a computer-market research company, ``is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing.'' In today's computer networks, some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed. With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> program, he said, ``You get more bang for the buck you've spent on computers.''
The program, which will be shipped in January 1990, runs on the Unix operating system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> will charge $5,000 for a license covering 10 users. The program now works on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> workstations and on computers made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multiflow Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Branford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> said it will sell versions later next year that run on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> machines.
The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network. A previously available program called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Network Computing System</ENAMEX>, developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> division, for instance, takes a task and splits it up into parts, divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing. But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system.
Applications won't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX> said, and the user of a computer won't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work. The Task Broker ``turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Kay</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX>'s workstation group.
