<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placer Dome Inc.</ENAMEX>, a big gold producer, said it may buy back as many as 16.4 million, or about 7% of its 234.7 million common shares outstanding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Placer Dome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vancouver</ENAMEX>, British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, said the proposed share repurchase, which may be made periodically on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> between tomorrow and Sept. 27, 1990, is an ``appropriate'' use of funds since the company believes its shares are undervalued.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placer Dome's</ENAMEX> shares closed at $16.125 each, down 12.5 cents. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placer Dome</ENAMEX> said it would cancel any shares it repurchases.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Placer Dome</ENAMEX> spokesman said the proposed repurchase wouldn't deter the company from pursuing acquisitions. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Placer Dome</ENAMEX> expects to have about 650 million Canadian dollars (US$552.4 million) of cash on hand a year from now, if it buys back all 16.4 million shares. That is roughly equal to the company's current cash position, he said.
