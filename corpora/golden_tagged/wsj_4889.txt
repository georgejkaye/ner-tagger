SMALL-BUSINESS LOBBIES for capital-gains tax cut. Would an IRA be better?
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Bentsen</ENAMEX> believes his proposal to expand individual retirement accounts will attract support from small-business owners, congressional insiders say. His reasoning: a tax-deductible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRA</ENAMEX> provides an annual tax break to most owners and their employees, while capital gains come into play only if a business is sold. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Democrat</ENAMEX> argues, start-up capital for most small firms doesn't come from investors seeking a profit but from friends and family members. The Democratic heads of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> small-business committees, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lafalce</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> and Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Bumpers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, favor the IRA idea.
But small-business lobbyists insist there is ``unqualified support'' for the capital-gains tax cut. They argue it would give investors more incentive to risk backing small companies. Venture capitalists provide only 5% of the equity capital that goes into small businesses, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Neece</ENAMEX>, a lobbyist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Small Business United.</ENAMEX> The rest, he says, comes from private investors, such as lawyers, doctors, friends and neighbors, who are sensitive to capital-gains taxes. Moreover, owners can currently set up tax-deductible <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Keogh</ENAMEX> savings plans.
One problem with an IRA plan backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Democrats, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Motley</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX>'s chief lobbyist, is that it would increase the top tax rate.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAX CREDITS</ENAMEX> for small business are pushed to ease costs of disabilities bill.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Pryor</ENAMEX> introduces legislation to provide a refundable tax credit of $5,000 to help small businesses that make structural or other changes to serve disabled patrons. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkansas Democrat</ENAMEX>'s proposal is in response to fears that the sweeping Senate-passed bill barring discrimination against the disabled  could require costly changes that would be especially burdensome to small businesses. A new law is almost certain to be enacted, despite small-business opposition to major provisions.
Currently, businesses get a tax deduction of as much as $35,000 for architectural changes designed to aid handicapped customers or employees. But a tax credit offers a dollar of credit for each dollar spent, compared with a deduction that's worth about 34 cents on the dollar. Under Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pryor</ENAMEX>'s plan, if a business has more than $5,000 in expenses in a year, it can apply the difference to the next year's tax credit.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Harkin</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iowa</ENAMEX>), a leading sponsor of the disabilities bill, supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pryor</ENAMEX> proposal, giving it a good chance of adoption in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FRANCHISE</ENAMEX> RULES: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Trade Commission</ENAMEX> sets a second comment period on its proposed new franchise rules. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Franchise Association</ENAMEX> asked that the record be reopened after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American Security Administrators Association</ENAMEX> issued a model franchise law it will propose for use by the states. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFA</ENAMEX> calls the model law a ``regulatory bombshell'' that would impose a new layer of complexity on franchise companies and wants to add comments about it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTC</ENAMEX>. The new comment period ends Nov. 21.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RIVALRIES</ENAMEX> FLARE between small-business groups. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Small Business United</ENAMEX> takes credit for helping to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Ways and Means</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Rostenkowski</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>) to support near repeal of the Section 89 employee-benefits law. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Federation of Independent Business</ENAMEX>, which demands total repeal, snipes that it wasn't invited to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rostenkowski</ENAMEX>'s office for the announcement because it doesn't ``do the chairman's bidding.'' Both groups played a role in the lawmaker's decision, a congressional staffer says: ``NSBU worked on the inside'' and ``the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFIB</ENAMEX> was on the outside throwing bombs.''
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER between federal labs and business is a flop so far.
That's the conclusion of a report on the government's three-year-old program to help businesses commercialize federal technology. The effort has resulted in ``frustrated scientists who can't commercialize their inventions and discouraged businesses who can't get at valuable technologies,'' says a staff report prepared for Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Wyden</ENAMEX>, chairman of a House small-business subcommittee. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX> Democrat has scheduled hearings for Oct. 5.
Although the 1986 law permits royalty agreements between government scientists and businesses, the program has little leadership and few new products have resulted, the study says. From the $60 billion a year the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> spends on research and development, the government realizes only $3 million in annual royalties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> says it will take up to five years to see concrete results from technology-transfer agreements now in the pipeline.
``The rub is scientists and researchers aren't businessmen'' and don't see the commercial value of their inventions, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Brumley</ENAMEX>, a former government official.
SMALL TALK: Major federal contract awards to women-owned businesses increased 1,000% from 1979 to 1988, reaching $1.9 billion last year, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SBA</ENAMEX> says.... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lazy Cat Productions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stillwater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Okla.</ENAMEX>, pursues a market niche with ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitty Video</ENAMEX>,'' a video for cats that features chirping songbirds.
