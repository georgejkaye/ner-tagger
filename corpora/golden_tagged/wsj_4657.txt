When a company goes bust, it's always better to be a junk-bond holder than a stockholder. At least, that's what junk investors think.
But there's a little-known principle in bankruptcy law that sometimes allows shareholders to wrest control of an insolvent company from its creditors. That rule now is being tested in a battle over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco D.S.</ENAMEX>, a prominent $1.3 billion leveraged buy-out of 1986 that entered bankruptcy court in 1988 and recently has been floating a proposal to restructure its debts.
Usually, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> bankruptcy proceedings, creditors are kings and they take whatever value remains in an insolvent company. Junkholders often get 90% of the reorganized company's stock in compensation for forgiving most of their loans, while shareholders may get wiped out.
But there's an exception, called the ``new value'' exception. It says shareholders who add new money and management skills to a bankruptcy reorganization deserve a big piece of the pie, because the resulting company will be healthier. Of course, if shareholders get more value, creditors get less, because the pie usually isn't big enough to feed everybody.
The ``new value'' principle dates from the 1930s but seldom is applied in bigger bankruptcy cases. Now, bankruptcy players say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> case affects everyone who holds bonds of debt-laden concerns. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> shareholders win, they say junkholders might lose out to equityholders in other bankruptcy cases.
Currently, a similar principle is being tested in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel</ENAMEX> case, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goldman Sachs</ENAMEX>, holder of 34% of Wheeling's stock, has said it might raise new equity and debt for that company's reorganization. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>'s preliminary plan would sell 55% of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> stock for $150 million in cash to the closely held company's majority shareholders, putting them in the saddle. Senior creditors would be paid in full. But junkholders would get new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> stock and bonds valued at only about 25 cents on the dollar. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Together</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> junkholders and trade creditors would get 45% of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> stock, instead of 94%, as they wanted.
The stakes are high: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> isn't exactly prospering now, but investment bankers involved in the current battle say the company's shares might be valued at more than $1 billion in five years' time, if all goes well.
As more Lbos unravel, the ``new value'' exception ``will be the issue of the 1990s,'' predicts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Schulte</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chilmark Partners</ENAMEX>, financial adviser to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> junkholders. ``Nobody will want to own a junk bond again'' if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> stockholders, who paid $19 million for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> common in the buy-out, can ``stiff'' junk buyers who paid $760 million for unsecured notes, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulte</ENAMEX> says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Revco</ENAMEX> says it hopes its proposal ``will lead to intensive, good faith negotiations to reach a consensual plan to get out'' of bankruptcy court. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> has sole right until Oct. 31 to file an official plan but doesn't yet have a target date for filing. Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>'s preliminary proposal turned up yesterday in federal bankruptcy court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX> as part of an unrelated filing.
The nation's second-biggest drugstore chain was taken private in December 1986 by management and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX>, which holds Revco junk as well as shares. Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> junkholders fear the company's plan to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law might be ``crammed down'' their throats.
Led by veteran vulture investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talton Embry</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Magten Asset Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, junkholders are fighting Revco and its shareholders with court motions, tense negotiations, nasty letters and a reorganization plan of their own. Their chief targets are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Steiner</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banner Industries</ENAMEX> and his designees on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>'s board, whom they think are the movers behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>'s proposal.
Banner, an aggressive acquirer of companies in recent years, is an indirect but powerful Revco player. In 1988, Banner bought a European investment fund that held a big stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.S. Partners</ENAMEX>, which now owns 60% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> common stock and wants to invest $150 million in the reorganization to maintain a controlling stake.
But with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> insolvent, the company ``belongs to its creditors,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embry</ENAMEX> recently wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> directors. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embry</ENAMEX>'s clients own about $120 million face value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>'s unsecured notes, bought for about 50 cents on the dollar before the bankruptcy-law filing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>'s various junk bonds currently are quoted at anywhere from five cents to 50 cents on the dollar.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Embry</ENAMEX> heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> noteholders committee, whose reorganization plan would give junior creditors 94% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> common. Under this plan, junkholders would offer to raise $75 million of new equity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>. They'd give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.S. Partners</ENAMEX> less than 1% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> common and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> managers, 4% to 5%. Some think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> junkholders, who'd get almost 40% of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> common under the company plan, are being greedy. ``I don't know why they'd be jealous'' of the majority shareholders, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathan Meyohas</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.S. Partners</ENAMEX> and a Revco director in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steiner</ENAMEX>'s camp.
While creditors think Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steiner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.S. Partners</ENAMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> -- they've asked the court to let them look into that issue -- Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyohas</ENAMEX> says that isn't so. Banner has three designated directors on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>'s board. After filling two vacant seats yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> now has a 10-man board.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyohas</ENAMEX> thinks the best plan should win. ``We're saying, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX> management is saying, the company needs $150 million, not $75 million'' of new cash, as junkholders are proposing. ``The sour experience of the past suggests there should be a little cushion allowing for mistakes,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meyohas</ENAMEX> says. Asked if an outside investor might pay more than $150 million for 55% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Revco</ENAMEX>, he says, ``the company is not for sale.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Miller</ENAMEX>, a lawyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.S. Partners</ENAMEX>, says the ``new value'' principle has prevailed in several smaller reorganizations in recent years, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jartran</ENAMEX>, which rents trailers. In those cases, ``the equity people got most of the new equity for putting in new money,'' he says.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chilmark</ENAMEX>'s Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schulte</ENAMEX> says that in the 1980s ``$200 billion of public junk bonds were sold on the assumption that a bond comes ahead of a stock'' when a company fails. Should equity investors be allowed to ``sprinkle a little dough on a leveraged pie'' and own a company after it defaults?
