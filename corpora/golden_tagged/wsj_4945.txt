<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber Group Inc.</ENAMEX> said an internal investigation of its dealings with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> didn't uncover any misconduct by the company or its employees.
The financial-services firm focused on the activities of a first vice president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Wilson</ENAMEX>, a former senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> official who is an important figure in the influence-peddling scandal at the federal housing agency.
The company's investigative report, released Friday, showed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> lobbied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> and played an important role in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>-related business. But the company said it had found ``no basis for reaching a conclusion'' that he sought to improperly influence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> decision makers.
There was one caveat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> report: It said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s expense-account reports showed that from 1986 through last August he had entertained ``various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials.'' In an interview, a company official said the entertainment involved lunches and dinners. In one case, the official said, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> picked up a $1,089 tab for a July 1986 dinner for a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> official and friend, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deborah Gore Dean</ENAMEX>, and 13 other people.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> said in its report that it didn't know whether the expenditures were proper, but the company said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> ``steadfastly maintained'' that he hadn't tried to improperly influence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials. His attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Banoun</ENAMEX>, said over the weekend that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s expenses were proper and had been reviewed by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> superiors.
Nonetheless, a House subcommittee, which will hear testimony from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> officials on Wednesday, is likely to investigate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>'s expenses. He also is scheduled to testify that same day, but he plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
Besides working as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> investment banker, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> made substantial profits from personal investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>-subsidized apartments.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> was the executive assistant to the Reagan administration's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> secretary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce</ENAMEX>, from 1981 to mid1984.
In its report, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> listed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>-related transactions on which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> worked for the company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber repeatedly</ENAMEX> said it didn't find any evidence of wrongdoing. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, now on a paid leave from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>, helped the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX> firm in a number of areas, including its successful bid last year to become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>'s financial adviser on the sale of loan assets.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> review panel had recommended another firm, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s undersecretary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Covitz</ENAMEX>, gave the job to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s report, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> said he spoke to three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covitz</ENAMEX> made his decision, including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covitz</ENAMEX>'s top aide. The company said, however, that the contract was ``awarded in an open competitive bidding process'' and that it ``found no evidence of impropriety.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX>, the company said, also worked on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> team that represented an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> state agency before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> in the May 1988 acquisition of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> loan assets. In that case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX> received $5.4 million in underwriting and finder's fees from the state agency, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arkansas Development Finance Agency</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> agency acquired $388.7 million in mortgage loans from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> unit, with proceeds from a federally backed bond issue underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>.
The company took pains to note that its large fees were negotiated in ``arm's length'' transactions with the president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wooten Epes</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epes</ENAMEX> later went to work as executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRC Resources Inc.</ENAMEX>, a consulting firm and a subsidiary of a law firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kutak</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rock & Campbell</ENAMEX>, that acted as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s counsel on the bond issue transaction. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epes</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kutak</ENAMEX> law firm wasn't involved in negotiating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>'s fees.
