<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX> expects net income to reach 120 billion yen (U.S. $857 million) in its current fiscal year, up from 114.6 billion yen in the previous year, Yutaka <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX>, president, said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> made the earnings projection for fiscal 1990, ending next March 31, in an interview with U.S. automotive writers attending the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> Motor Show.
The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and because of currency-exchange fluctuations.
During the next decade, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. Last year, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kume</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> exported slightly over one million vehicles, and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at its factories in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>. But by 1992, he added, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> will build one million vehicles a year outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, or sufficient to equal exports.
``By the end of the 1990s,'' he said, ``we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.'' That will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity, he acknowledged, but didn't provide specific details.
