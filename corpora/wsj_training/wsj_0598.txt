<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX> critics used to complain of ``stop and go'' monetary policies. They claimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt. But under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Greenspan</ENAMEX> that has changed. A supremely cautious man, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman is forever blinking yellow.
Indeed, his caution has become legendary within the government. He fusses endlessly over economic statistics, dissecting them in dozens of ways, probing for hours in search of potential problems. After thoroughly digesting reams of information, he often concludes that more data are needed, and when he finally decides to act, his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small.
Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials urged Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets. But he refused, claiming that he wanted to see what happened Monday morning before making any public statement.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s ranks. A ``senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> official'' spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX>, saying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed. The statement angered Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>, but it was greeted with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets. And, while the mutinous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> member hasn't gone public, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> governors, most notably Vice Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manuel Johnson</ENAMEX>, are known to have disagreed with the chairman's decision to remain silent. Ironically, the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>, who is mistakenly seen as the source. At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Dodd</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Brady</ENAMEX> that ``Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s'' announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a ``very important statement.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> hesitantly replied that he wasn't sure whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> ``made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market's plunge, when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets. A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system. And, by the end of that week, the key federal funds interest rate, which is largely controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>, had settled at 8.75%, barely changed from the level of just under 9% that prevailed the previous week.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> is cautious to a fault. Signs of growing weakness in the economy, paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control, have caused them to wonder why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman is so grudging in reducing rates.
Those concerns aren't expressed in public. In fact, the administration and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds, fearing stories about an administration-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> split added to the stock market's jitters. Still, the split is there.
The administration's concerns are understandable. The economy is showing signs of weakness, particularly among manufacturers. Exports, which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years, seem to have stalled. Factory payrolls and production fell in September, and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> remains reluctant to loosen policy, partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> banks who oppose credit easing. In addition, the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road. Inflation may be stable at the moment, running at about 4.5%. But if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> eases too soon, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> fears, prices may begin to accelerate again next year. Moreover, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> holds tight, it may be able gradually to reduce inflation, moving toward the zero-inflation goal that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX> chairman embraced in testimony to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> last week.
So far, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX>'s cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well. His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession. ``We've gotten through two stock market crashes, and we've gone through an election without any major problems,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hale</ENAMEX>, an economist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX>. ``I think you have to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> a good rating.''
But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession, perhaps starting early next year. If that happens, Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greenspan</ENAMEX> could well become an open target. Already, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is toying with legislation to curb the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fed</ENAMEX>'s independence. If the economy turns down, such proposals could gain strong momentum.
