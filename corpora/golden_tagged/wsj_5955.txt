<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitro S.A.</ENAMEX> said it extended for a second time its unsolicited, $20-a-share tender offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor Glass Container Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX> The offer, valued at about $251.4 million for the 89% stake <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX> doesn't already own, is now set to expire Thursday at 5 p.m. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EDT</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monterrey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>-based conglomerate, had previously extended until last Thursday its offer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor Glass</ENAMEX>, a maker of bottles and other glass containers. The offer is considered the first unsolicited bid by a Mexican company for a U.S. concern.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>'s board unanimously rejected the offer last month and adopted a poison pill, or takeover-defense plan, to thwart <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX>'s bid. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX> spokesman said the company believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vitro</ENAMEX>'s offer is too low.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX> said about 7.7 million shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor</ENAMEX>'s 13.9 million shares outstanding have already been tendered to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vitro</ENAMEX>.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anchor Glass</ENAMEX> closed at $18.50, down 87.5 cents.
