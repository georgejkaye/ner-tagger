On Sept. 8, in his last month as the chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter T. Buchanan</ENAMEX> quietly announced that a world-wide search for new institutional shareholders was complete.
Seven Japanese life-insurance companies, a Japanese trust company, three <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. insurers</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgian</ENAMEX> investor group and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mideastern Suliman Olayan</ENAMEX> holding company had taken stakes in the firm nine months after its $1.1 billion merger with European affiliate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX>. ``Now everyone's focus can be directed toward building the best investment bank in the world,'' he told the firm's 6,400 employees in an internal memorandum.
``The brass ring is out there for the taking. Go get it.''
It may take awhile. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s main focus currently is damage control. As the 55-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX> prepares to retire and go fishing next month, the closely held firm has been shaken by a debacle it helped create. Wall Street is ablaze with concern over possible corporate financial train wrecks.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s most lucrative client of the decade, teetered off the track, a casualty of its multibillion dollar debt load. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financings</ENAMEX> for several other highly leveraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> clients also are struggling. A $475 million junk-bond offering for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Mattress Co.</ENAMEX> unraveled recently just as it was coming to market, leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> with most of that debt in the form of an illiquid, or now unmarketable, loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Mattress</ENAMEX>.
In a twist of fate, the credit of one set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> clients, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Allied</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Federated</ENAMEX> department-store units, looked so bad earlier this month that another client, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Mattress</ENAMEX>, temporarily stopped doing business with it, the companies' agents confirmed.
By last week, the strain was apparent. ``I'm looking forward to this year being over,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E. Mayer</ENAMEX>, the soft-spoken chief executive of the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston Corp.</ENAMEX> unit.
The new management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX>, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John M. Hennessy</ENAMEX>, is confident the storm clouds soon will pass. ``Do we have problems here? Sure,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hennessy</ENAMEX>. ``Does everyone on Wall Street have problems? Sure. This is a firm with an extremely powerful franchise. We have built relationships that will last. If anyone has some modicum of trust in investment banking, it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston.</ENAMEX>''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hennessy</ENAMEX>, 53, picked by Swiss banking giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> to succeed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buchanan</ENAMEX> next month, ran the highly profitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX> affiliate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> the past six years.
For all the upset, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> remains a powerhouse in mergers and acquisitions -- despite the tumultuous departure last year of its former merger stars, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Wasserstein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph R. Perella</ENAMEX>. During the first six months this year, it led its Wall Street rivals by completing 83 transactions totaling $40.2 billion, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities Data Co.</ENAMEX> The only big deal that eluded it so far is the record $25 billion buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RJR Nabisco Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> is advising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> in its pending $6.75 billion employee takeover and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX> on its $3.65 billion acquisition.
But having earned well more than $200 million as an adviser and underwriter of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>'s highly leveraged assembly of a U.S. retailing empire during a three-year period -- more than it has earned from any other client during the past decade -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> could lose a substantial portion of that amount from the Canadian conglomerate's unwinding.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> owns about $125 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allied and Federated</ENAMEX> bonds, which fetched as little as 25 cents on the dollar before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> negotiated a $250 million emergency-cash infusion from the Canadian real-estate giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olympia & York Developments Ltd.</ENAMEX> a week ago, according to people familiar with the situation. In addition, it has about $250 million of currently illiquid exchange notes to Federated along with about 4 1/2% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated</ENAMEX>'s equity.
A top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> official says the firm expects to have a loss of no more than $30 million from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> investments, although he concedes the firm can't sell them because the market is so fragile. ``If I dumped our securities, we would have a panic and our role isn't to panic the market,'' he says. (In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> is earning a healthy interest rate on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>-related bonds.)
Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> likely will have to mark these investments down sharply when the quarter ends. ``Certainly, unless things turn around by the end of the month, earnings will be down for the third quarter,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Aran</ENAMEX>, a senior vice president in charge of the financial institutions group at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor's Corp.</ENAMEX>
``While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s business is well managed, the fundamental riskiness of its business remains,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Kriz</ENAMEX>, a securities-industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moody's Investors Service.</ENAMEX>
More concerned about its image right now than a potential loss, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s senior executives, led by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hennessy</ENAMEX>, a former assistant secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Treasury</ENAMEX>, fanned out across the globe last week to deflect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> fallout and mollify new shareholders.
``Capitalism is messy,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hennessy</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> between meetings with his new, somewhat rattled Japanese shareholders. The ``Japanese, who have been quite important investors and who own 12% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX>, wanted to know'' the extent of the damage caused by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> debacle. But ``people don't look at the firm {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>}, they look at the deal,'' he said.
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> executives also say the problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> bonds shouldn't be perceived as a reflection on the firm, pointing to currently depressed junk-bond offerings arranged by other Wall Street firms. These include junk bonds issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resorts International Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southland Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrated Resources Inc.</ENAMEX> ``We're all consenting adults in this market,'' a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> official says.
That is cold comfort for some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> customers battered by huge losses on their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> bond holdings. As recently as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> was still sending its clients research reports extolling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federated and Allied</ENAMEX> bonds. ``We're all big boys, but this certainly doesn't help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s credibility,'' says a large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Coast</ENAMEX> money manager who owns some depressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>-related securities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> ``made only one mistake, but it was a big mistake.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> isn't <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s only problem. Preoccupied with its own reorganization and the last-ditch effort to put together a financial bailout for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> has struggled through the first nine months. The closely held investment bank doesn't disclose its earnings. But ``the first quarter was miserable,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> executive. ``The second was one of our best ever, and the third {which ends next week} looks mediocre. But we should come out OK and virtually unscathed.''
As it performed erratically, dozens of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s top traders, salesmen and merger specialists either were forced out or lured away by rivals -- an unusually high attrition rate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston.</ENAMEX> Staff morale has plummeted during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> troubles, some employees say.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Holland</ENAMEX>, a managing director who helped create <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s highly successful money-management division, defected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salomon Brothers Inc.</ENAMEX> in the spring. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> declines to comment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Mendez</ENAMEX>, a managing director who helped make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s equity department one of the most formidable on Wall Street in the 1980s, was fired after a power struggle with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtis R. Welling</ENAMEX>, a managing director who took over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mendez</ENAMEX>'s job.
Amid the internal feuding at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX>, dangling seven-figure annual-income contracts, hired a top equity salesman, bond salesman and virtually the entire convertible-bond department at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drexel</ENAMEX> ``guaranteed these guys three times what they got here for three years and let them split 30% of the profits,'' says a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> executive. ``We're not about to match that.''
Meanwhile, the new management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> is putting a new stamp on the place. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deloitte Haskins & Sells</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX>'s auditor for several decades, was quietly replaced earlier this month by Peat, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitchell & Co.</ENAMEX>, the auditor for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX>.
However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX>'s initial plan to secure a single major Japanese investor to balance the 44.5% -- and effectively controlling -- stake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS Holding</ENAMEX> went awry. As the $200 billion high-risk junk-bond market sputtered and revenue from the securities industry plummeted in the first quarter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS First Boston</ENAMEX> scuttled that strategy and settled on 14 different shareholders.
The upheaval in the junk-bond market has focused attention on the so-called bridge loans advanced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> and other Wall Street firms to finance highly leveraged takeovers. All told, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> had almost $2 billion outstanding of these temporary loans to a string of highly leveraged companies -- or almost twice its equity capital of $1.1 billion -- when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campeau</ENAMEX> squeeze hit. ``A build-up of bridge financing that is twice equity should be a cause for concern,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen W. Joynt</ENAMEX>, an executive director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch Investors Service</ENAMEX>, a credit-rating agency. ``These are sizable, illiquid financings until placed with investors.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Boston</ENAMEX> isn't sure whether it will provide a $700 million bridge to help complete a $3.5 billion acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical International Inc.</ENAMEX> Late last week, it reduced its bridge loans to slightly more than $1 billion as it syndicated some of its risks to other concerns.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hennessy</ENAMEX>, who successfully handled several large-scale defections and market dislocations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Suisse First Boston</ENAMEX>, isn't worried by the recent bad news. ``I'm basically relaxed,'' he says. ``Given what we've done this year, I take it as a pretty good report card. I can't remember a time when the business hasn't been so bullish. We have the prototype investment bank of the 1990s.''
