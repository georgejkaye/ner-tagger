<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William G. Remington</ENAMEX>, 58 years old, relinquished his posts as chairman and president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peerless Tube Co.</ENAMEX>, partly ``for health reasons,'' the company said. It didn't elaborate.

This year the company's sales have been weak and the costs of aluminum -- the company's primary raw material -- have been high, denting earnings. The company in May announced that it was cutting the quarterly dividend in half to five cents a share as a result.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, the company reported that six-month sales fell to $26.4 million, from $27.2 million a year earlier. Net income dropped to $15,910 from $642,916.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederic Remington</ENAMEX>, who had been senior vice president of engineering, also takes the new post of chief executive officer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potts</ENAMEX>, formerly senior vice president of production, was also named chief operating officer, another new post.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Remingtons</ENAMEX> and their family control about 32.3% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peerless</ENAMEX>, which was formed by their father. A spokesman said no other upper management changes are expected.
