The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> is investigating the safety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn Co's</ENAMEX>. prescription drug Halcion, the most widely prescribed sleeping agent in the world.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> said an advisory committee that monitors drugs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halcion</ENAMEX> will meet later this week to discuss reports that Halcion users suffer a disproportionately high number of negative side effects, including hallucinations and heightened aggressiveness. The committee could recommend any of a number of actions, including taking the drug off the market or changing the recommended dosage. But an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said it was too early to tell what moves the agency would make.
Perhaps the most sensational case involving suspected Halcion side effects is that of a 58-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> woman who shot and killed her 83-year-old mother after having taken Halcion. Two doctors testified that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Halcion</ENAMEX> contributed to the woman's violent behavior, and a judge dismissed murder charges against her. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> contends that the woman was taking other medicine at the time, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halcion</ENAMEX> wasn't to blame for the incident. A company spokeswoman added yesterday that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX>'s studies have found that Halcion users are no more likely to encounter unwanted side effects than users of any other drug of the same family.
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kalamazoo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mich.</ENAMEX>, pharmaceuticals maker is already seeing a slide in Halcion sales apparently caused by reports of unwanted side effects, analysts said yesterday. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX>'s world-wide sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Halcion</ENAMEX> are expected to fall to about $235 million this year from about $260 million in 1988, analysts said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> stock closed at $36.375, unchanged, in composite trading on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> yesterday.
Halcion is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX>'s second-biggest sales item, and is one of a class of popular drugs, called benzodiazepines, prescribed to treat a variety of conditions, including sleeplessness, depression and anxiety. Some of the other benzodiazepines are Librium, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valium</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xanax</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> has already discontinued production of the strongest dosage of Halcion pills, in keeping with the world-wide trend to prescribe the lowest effective drug dose, the company spokeswoman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> also may have a cushion if sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halcion</ENAMEX> are reduced. The same FDA advisory committee that is investigating problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halcion</ENAMEX> is also considering whether to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> to expand the market for its leading revenue producer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xanax</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> is weighing whether to permit the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xanax</ENAMEX> as a treatment for panic disorders. Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xanax</ENAMEX> is approved for relief of milder anxiety problems. In 1988, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upjohn</ENAMEX> sold an estimated $395 million of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xanax</ENAMEX>, analysts said.
