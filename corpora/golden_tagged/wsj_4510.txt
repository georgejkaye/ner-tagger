The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> declared <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>'s import quotas on beef to be an unfair trade barrier but said it is deferring retaliation until the ruling body of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</ENAMEX> completes its assessment of the issue.
The U.S. announcement signaled a long-delayed victory for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Meat Institute</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based trade body representing U.S. meat packers and processors. The institute filed its complaint against the quotas in February 1988, but U.S. action was stalled by the separate GATT investigation.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX> dispute-settlement panel ruled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s favor last summer, but that decision won't be binding until the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX>-based body's highest authority, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT Council</ENAMEX>, votes on it. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> several times has blocked consideration of the issue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX>, claiming that its unstable balance-of-payments condition justifies the existence of the quotas.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX> is expected to take up the issue at its next meeting Oct. 11. U.S. trade officials said a favorable vote would strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s demands that the quotas be scrapped. If <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> still refuses to cooperate, the Bush administration has the authority to impose punitive duties on a number of South Korean products.
After banning beef imports for more than three years, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> set a quota of 14,500 metric tons for the second half of 1988 and increased it to 39,000 metric tons in 1989. The meat institute has charged that these curbs are costing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> packers several million dollars of potential sales.
U.S. Trade Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla Hills</ENAMEX> said she is delaying retaliatory action to ``allow additional time for the GATT process.'' She warned, however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> will draw up a list of South Korean products to be subject to sanctions by mid-November ``if substantial movement toward resolution of the issue in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATT</ENAMEX> has not occurred by that time.''
The statement clearly was intended to caution <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> against attempting to block the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">council</ENAMEX>'s action again. U.S. trade law allows Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hills</ENAMEX> to delay retaliation for 180 days under certain circumstances.
