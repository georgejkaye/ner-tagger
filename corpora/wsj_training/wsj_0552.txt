When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo NV</ENAMEX> fell out of bed.
Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business, which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company's sales, led to huge losses and left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX>'s survival in doubt. It wasn't until the early 1980s that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> nursed itself back to health.
Now, as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Akzo</ENAMEX> says it is in far better shape to cope. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Investment</ENAMEX> analysts generally agree.
Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has spent 3.9 billion guilders ($1.88 billion) on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance. During the same period, the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets.
The fibers business, whose products go into textiles, carpeting and myriad industrial uses, now accounts for only 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX>'s sales. ``We have definitely become less cyclical,'' Syb <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX>, executive vice president-finance, said in an interview.
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> hasn't yet found a way to achieve another goal: a large presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market for prescription drugs. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said prices for U.S. pharmaceutical companies remain too high, making it unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> will pursue any major acquisitions in that area. But he said Akzo is considering ``alliances'' with American drug companies, although he wouldn't elaborate.
An indication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX>'s success in reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third-quarter results. Analysts expect the company to show profit of about 225 million guilders, up 9% from 206.3 million guilders a year earlier.
A bigger test will come next year if, as many analysts expect, bulk chemical prices slump in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
``Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jaap Visker</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV</ENAMEX>. He figures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year. The bank projects Akzo will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990, up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988.
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">James Capel & Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie Ashurst</ENAMEX> notes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has only minor petrochemical operations, is small in plastics and doesn't make fertilizers.
Thus, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics, it has less to fear from the current slump.
The company is exposed to bulk chemicals, however. Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, they are generally stable in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said. A decline may come in the first half of 1990, he said, but the market doesn't appear on the verge of a severe downturn.
To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has invested heavily in specialty chemicals, which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX>'s biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stauffer Chemical Co.</ENAMEX>'s specialty chemical business for $625 million.
In a less glamorous field, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is the world's biggest producer of industrial salt, used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting ice. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> also makes products derived from salt, such as chlorine and caustic soda.
In the fibers division, profit remains weak, largely because of persistent overcapacity. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is still slimming down: It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Netherlands</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>.
Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses, such carbon fibers and aramid, extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet-proof vests.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twaron</ENAMEX> aramid fiber is a distant second to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Du Pont Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kevlar</ENAMEX>, which dominates the market. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said world-wide industry sales of aramid fibers are expected to total about $500 million this year. Sales growth of 10% a year seems possible, he said, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> expects its Twaron business to become profitable in 1990.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints, auto finishes and industrial coatings. In August, for example, it completed the $110 million acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliance Universal Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> maker of industrial coatings for wood, metals and plastics, from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyler Corp.</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX>'s drug business, where profits have shown litle change for the past five years, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> predicted moderate profit growth. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> is the leading seller of birth-control pills in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> hopes to have approval to sell its Marvelon pill in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> in 1992.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akzo</ENAMEX> also has small operations in diagnostic tests, generic drugs and veterinary products. Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bergsma</ENAMEX> said. Among the leading products is a flu shot for horses.
