<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon Products Inc.</ENAMEX> cut its forecast of 1989 earnings, prompting speculation on Wall Street that the company may soon be a takeover target again.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Preston</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avon</ENAMEX>, said in a statement that weak sales and the strong U.S. dollar have prompted the company to reduce its forecast of 1989 per-share earnings to a range of $1.95 to $2.15, down from an earlier estimate of $2.30 to $2.40 a share.
Avon, primarily a door-to-door sales concern, said its new gift and jewelry products are posting disappointing sales, a trend expected to continue as the key Christmas selling season starts. Non-cosmetic products account for about half of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avon</ENAMEX>'s fourth-quarter sales.
The trend appears so significant that the company has also reduced its 1990 earnings estimates below the $3.35 to $3.45 it previously forecast. Avon has decided not to make any new projections for 1990 earnings at this time.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avon</ENAMEX> closed at $31.75 a share, down $2.125. The stock reached a 1989 high of $41.25 on May 17.
Earlier this year, Avon rejected takeover bids from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irwin Jacobs</ENAMEX>. At that time, Avon management not only projected increased earnings but stated that Avon shareholders would benefit from cost efficiencies then being implemented. In August, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> to discuss Avon's future prospects. Following that meeting, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> stated he was happy with the company's direction.
Several Wall Street money managers expressed severe disappointment with Avon management and said they believed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX>, who controls a bit more than 10% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avon</ENAMEX>'s stock, may now try to make another run at the company. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> couldn't be reached for comment.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Ashenberg</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</ENAMEX>, said that Avon is experiencing what he described as serious roadblocks. He also questioned whether the company's earnings projections were unduly affected by the bids by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amway</ENAMEX>.
``It's conceivable that estimates by management were made in a frenzy to protect itself from hostile takeovers then underway,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashenberg</ENAMEX>. ``If the disappointment is deep enough another hostile offer may be... forthcoming.''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX>, responding to this criticism, said through a spokesman, ``There was no way in May to forecast that the gift and jewelry lines would underperform in the fourth quarter. We expected continued growth of 4% to 5%, which we could build on by adding sales representatives.'' He said the lower-than-expected gift and jewelry sales ``will more than offset the expanded sales staff.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> denied that the company made its earnings projections as a response to the bids by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amway</ENAMEX> or Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Renck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jr.</ENAMEX>, managing partner at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R.L. Renck & Co.</ENAMEX>, said some investors will undoubtedly be disappointed with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Avon</ENAMEX>'s performance, but he praised the company for releasing the bad news quickly. ``The real question that comes to mind is whether this is an Avon trend or an indication of what the Christmas selling season is going to be like,'' he said.
In 1988, profit from continuing operations was $1.70 a fully diluted share. After a charge related to an accounting change and a loss from discontinued operations, Avon had a loss of $404.5 million for the year.
