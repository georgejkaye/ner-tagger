<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen Corp.</ENAMEX> said a lessor of one of the company's facilities obtained a court order temporarily blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>'s acquisition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mall Drive Associates</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> limited partnership and lessor of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> facility in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Commack</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, is seeking to stop the acquisition, claiming it will violate the lease agreement.
Under the terms of the lease, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> is barred from merging or restructuring if the surviving entity has a net worth less than what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> had the immediately preceding day, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Margolin</ENAMEX>, a lawyer for Mall Drive. In a complaint filed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York state</ENAMEX> court in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX>, Mall Drive said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vernitron</ENAMEX> would take on substantial long-term debt to finance the acquisition.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX>, an electronics technology concern, said the claims are meritless. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX>, a closely held industrial electronics firm based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Deer Park</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, reached a definitive agreement in May to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> for $25 a share, or about $320 million. The acquisition had been scheduled to close on or before Sept. 30, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> said that Mall Drive has rejected offers by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vernitron</ENAMEX> to settle the case. The court is scheduled to consider Mall Drive's request for a permanent injunction on Monday.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollmorgen</ENAMEX> shares rose $1.125 to close at $23.25.
