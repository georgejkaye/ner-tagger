<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> is planning a big coming-out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers. But an uninvited guest is expected to try to crash the party.
On the morning of the long-planned announcement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> is to introduce its own new mainframe. ``Their attitude is, `You want to talk mainframes, we'll talk mainframes,''' says one computer industry executive.
``They're deliberately trying to steal our thunder,'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> executive complains. ``Maybe we should take it as a compliment.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s target is the $40 billion market for mainframe computers, the closet-sized number-crunchers that nearly every big company needs to run its business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Armonk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, has dominated the market for decades.
That doesn't scare <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>, which has grown to be the world's second-largest computer maker by poaching customers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s mid-range machines. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maynard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes, and it has spent almost $1 billion developing the new technology. A spoiler, nimble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandem Computers Inc.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cupertino</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> appears more worried about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>, which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line, dubbed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAX</ENAMEX> 9000. ``It's going to be nuclear war,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Willmott</ENAMEX>, a consultant with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen Group Inc.</ENAMEX>
The surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market, where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s traditional mainframe rivals, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unisys Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control Data Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCR Corp.</ENAMEX>, have struggled recently.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> is promising a new approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert M. Glorioso</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s vice president for high performance systems, says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves, but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations, personal computers, printers and other devices. And unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s water-cooled mainframes, it doesn't need any plumbing.
The challengers will have a big price advantage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> is expected to tag its new line from about $1.24 million to $4.4 million and up, depending on configuration. That's about half the price of comparably equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandem</ENAMEX>'s pricing is just as aggressive.
The heightened competition will hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> at a difficult time. The computer giant's current mainframe line, which has sold well and has huge profit margins, is starting to show its age. The new 3090s due next week will boost performance by only about 8% to 10%. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> isn't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991.
Still, no one expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s rivals to deliver a knockout. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has a near-monopoly on mainframes, with an estimated 70% share of the market. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> is five times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> -- and 40 times the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandem</ENAMEX> -- and wields enormous market power. It counts among its customers a majority of the world's largest corporations, which entrust their most critical business information to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> computers.
``We're not going to walk in and replace a company's corporate accounting system if it's already running on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframe,'' concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth H. Olsen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s president.
He says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will target faster-growing market segments such as on-line transaction processing, which includes retail-sales tracking, airline reservations and bank-teller networks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tandem</ENAMEX>, which already specializes in on-line transaction processing, is a potent competitor in that market.
A key marketing target for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will be the large number of big customers who already own both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> systems. One such company is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Rose</ENAMEX>, a vice president, technological and strategic planning at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX>, says that despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s low prices, ``we aren't about to unplug our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframes for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEC</ENAMEX> machine. The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings.''
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> is still looking seriously at the 9000. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAX</ENAMEX> to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts, juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day, he says. As that system grows, larger computers may be needed. ``In the past, customers had to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> when they outgrew the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAX</ENAMEX>. Now they don't have to,'' he says. ``That's going to cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> revenue.''
Analysts say Digital can expect this pent-up demand for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAX</ENAMEX> to fuel strong sales next year. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry F. Willman</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</ENAMEX>, estimates the 9000 could boost sales by more than $1 billion in the fiscal year beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>. He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s largest customers.
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> will announce a full family of mainframes next week, it isn't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year. The first model available will be the 210, which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger, or vector processor, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Shannon</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Data Corp.</ENAMEX>, a market research concern.
Four more models, aimed squarely at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s commercial customers, are expected to begin shipping in late June. Most analysts don't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter, which begins next July 1.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s new line has been a long time coming. The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product, and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX>'s failure to deliver a true mainframe-class machine before now may have cost the company as much as $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 1989, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Willman</ENAMEX> says.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> will face still more competition in coming months. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amdahl Corp.</ENAMEX>, backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujitsu Ltd.</ENAMEX>, has a growing share of the market with its low-priced, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>-compatible machines. And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Advanced Systems</ENAMEX>, a joint venture of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hitachi Ltd.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Data Systems</ENAMEX>, is expected to unveil a line of powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>-compatible mainframes later this year.
