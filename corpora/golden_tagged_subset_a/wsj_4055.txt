<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbilt Corp.</ENAMEX> said it and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H&R Block Inc.</ENAMEX> were unable to reach agreement on the terms of an amendatory accord and have terminated merger plans.
The plans had called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbilt</ENAMEX> shareholders to receive $18 in value of Block common stock for each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbilt</ENAMEX> common share. Block said that in settlement Microbilt agreed to reimburse it a certain amount, which wasn't disclosed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbilt</ENAMEX> also said it received an unsolicited proposal from another publicly traded company for a merger that would provide stock from that concern at a value greater than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbilt</ENAMEX>'s common-stock closing price of $14.75 last Thursday, but less than $18.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, Block said it had agreed to acquire the data-communications equipment concern for about $144 million in stock.
