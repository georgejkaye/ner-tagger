<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Former Housing and Urban Development</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Pierce</ENAMEX> exercised his right against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions before a House subcommittee investigating the federal housing scandal.
``On the advice of counsel and for the reasons given in my opening statement, I respectfully decline to answer the question and I assert the rights guaranteed me by the Fifth Amendment,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> said to each of eight questions from the panel's chairman, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lantos</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>).
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> refused to respond to allegations of political influence-peddling at his agency, the subcommittee released documents indicating that former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> hastily authorized the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> funds in 1982 for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> project in an effort to boost a GOP senatorial candidate.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> had testified last spring that politics didn't play a role in the awarding of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> funds. But the documents showed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> was aware that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> had authorized funding for a project in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ewing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX> A memo indicated that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> learned of the funding hours before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> announced the award at a Sept. 17, 1982, campaign appearance on behalf of then-GOP Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Millicent Fenwick</ENAMEX>, who lost her Senate race a month later.
Ironically, funds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> award were diverted from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, project that has figured prominently in the subcommittee's investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX>. Other former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> officials have testified that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> directly ordered that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> project be funded, despite opposition from his agency's professional staff. A former law associate of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s was among the project's boosters.
Efforts to reach Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> through his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> attorney were unsuccessful yesterday.
In his opening statement yesterday, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, who had been subpoenaed by the subcommittee after refusing to appear voluntarily Sept. 15, complained that his lawyers haven't had sufficient time to review 48 boxes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> documents and other material he said may be relevant.
``Under these circumstances, my counsel has advised me, and I have agreed, to assert my constitutional rights under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fifth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sixth</ENAMEX> amendments by refusing to answer questions before this subcommittee,'' he said, reading his statement in a small, crowded hearing room. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sixth</ENAMEX> Amendment guarantees the right to counsel.
Republican and Democratic members of the subcommittee were unanimous in praising the fairness they said Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> accorded to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>. ``It's been four months since his last testimony,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Shays</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>). ``It defies logic that he needs more time.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Perito</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s chief counsel, later complained that the panel appears to have prejudged his client. Because his firm was hired Sept. 6, ``we just didn't have enough time'' to prepare Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perito</ENAMEX> said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> noted several times that using the Fifth Amendment doesn't imply any guilt on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s part. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Wise</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">W.va.</ENAMEX>), however, said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s refusal to answer questions ``does nothing to quell the trial that's going on in public opinion.'' He added, ``Ultimately, you are the one who loses by this.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> scandals, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> said in his opening statement, ``include political influence peddling, rampant waste, blatant favoritism, giveaways and gross mismanagement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> programs.'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> ran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> during the eight years of the Reagan administration.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television</ENAMEX> and radio broadcasts of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s appearance weren't allowed, because his lawyers invoked a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> rule that permits subpoenaed witnesses to bar broadcast equipment. His lawyers also requested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> members who aren't members of the subcommittee be excluded from the proceedings. They weren't.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> rebuked Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perito</ENAMEX> when he tried to ask if a decision had been made on his request to exclude non-subcommittee members from questioning his client. ``At this hearing,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lantos</ENAMEX> told Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>'s attorneys, ``you are in fact a potted plant.'' The statement alluded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>-Contra hearings, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX>'s attorney, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brendan Sullivan</ENAMEX>, said, ``I'm not a potted plant.''
Outside the hearing room, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perito</ENAMEX> complained of being ``muzzled by the chairman.'' His associate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Plotkin</ENAMEX>, said that ``we have to wait and see'' if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX> will answer questions at his next scheduled appearance Oct. 27.
