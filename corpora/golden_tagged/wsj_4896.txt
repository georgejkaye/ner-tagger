Stocks tripped over a falling dollar and tumbling bonds, but volume was light.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average fell 22.42 to 2659.19. Among the broader market measures, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard & Poor</ENAMEX>'s 500-stock index fell 2.82 to 344.23. Some 121,130,000 shares traded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>, the lightest volume since July 3 when volume dropped to 68.9 million shares, a 1989 low.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chung Lew</ENAMEX>, head trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kleinwort Benson North America Inc.</ENAMEX>, said there is broad uncertainty in the market over the implications of a declining dollar. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consequently</ENAMEX>, stock traders looked to long-term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds.
The Treasury bond market provided an illustration of what the dollar's slide means for international investors' appetite for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> securities. As bonds fell in anticipation of less foreign buying, traders sold stocks.
``Investment flows are the most important factor in the stock market,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lew</ENAMEX>. ``And a rising and falling currency has tremendous implications for investment flows.''
A number of blue chip shares that were popular recently were hit with hard selling. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> fell 2 1/8 to 155 1/2. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> fell 1 1/8 to 118 3/4. ``I think there is profit-taking'' in blue chips, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Solomon</ENAMEX>, technical analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX>. ``Bearishness is front-running bearishness'' as October nears, he said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Procter & Gamble</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> are two stocks often used in computer guided stock-index arbitrage strategies, in which traders attempt to capitalize on price differences between a basket of stocks and the related stock-index futures contract. Program selling kicked in at several points yesterday as traders bought ``cheaper'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&P</ENAMEX> futures -- which fell in reaction to tumbling bond prices -- and sold the underlying stocks.
So-called country funds, which invest entirely in one country's stocks, also slumped. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thai Fund</ENAMEX> tumbled 3 1/4, to 23, a 12% decline. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> Fund fell 1 to 12, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX> Fund slipped 1 to 13. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX> Fund, however, rebounded late in the day and closed 3/4 higher at 26 3/4.
Analysts say many of these closed-end funds, which surged recently on heavy Japanese buying, are overvalued because they are trading at historically large premiums to their underlying stocks. A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares outstanding, like other companies whose shares trade on stock exchanges or over the counter.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX>, the most active <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX> issue by a wide margin, jumped 5 1/4 to 26 3/8 as 6.2 million shares changed hands in composite trading. Entertainment industry sources said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX>, long rumored to be pursuing the company, agreed to acquire it for $26 to $28 a share. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> gained 1 3/8 to 59 1/2.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCA</ENAMEX>, another movie company often cited in takeover speculation, rose 1 7/8 to 63 5/8 in heavier-than-usual trading. Elsewhere in the group, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paramount Communications</ENAMEX> added 1 1/8 to 54 3/4 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orion Pictures</ENAMEX> rose 1 to 22 1/8. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coca-Cola</ENAMEX>, one of the few stocks in the industrial average to close higher, went up 5/8 to 63. Among other blue chips, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> eased 1/4 to 116 1/4.
Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Telephone & Telegraph</ENAMEX> fell 1 to 42 1/8 on speculation that the company plans to disclose a business transaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecommunications</ENAMEX>, rather than a reorganization or restructuring, at a news conference planned for today. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Telecom</ENAMEX> climbed 1 5/8 to 46 1/8; there were rumors that the arrangement would call for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT*/NNP&T</ENAMEX> to acquire a stake of as much as 20% in the company, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Professional Investor Report.
Precious-metals stocks moved higher as the nervousness about the dollar attracted buyers to those issues, usually seen as a safe haven for investors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homestake Mining</ENAMEX> went up 1/4 to 16 5/8 in active trading, Battle Mountain Gold added 1/4 to 15 5/8, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Barrick Resources</ENAMEX> gained 1 5/8 to 25 1/4, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freeport-Mcmoran Gold</ENAMEX> rose 1/2 to 12 1/8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newmont Gold</ENAMEX> rose 1 3/8 to 37 3/4.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX>, the parent company of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>, retreated 7 1/8 to 274. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> asked the company for more data on a planned $300-a-share leveraged buy-out by a labor-management group, because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways</ENAMEX>' participation in the offer.
Other airline stocks also fell; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Tranportation Average dropped 20.09 to 1428.17. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR</ENAMEX>, the owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, lost 1 3/8 to 77 7/8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> fell 1 to 70 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Board</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air</ENAMEX>, the parent of Continental and Eastern airlines, dropped 1 3/8 to 17 on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>.
Dividend-related trading swelled volume in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX>, which eased 5/8 to 42 on 2.7 million shares. The stock, which carries a 7.8% dividend yield, went ex-dividend yesterday.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oryx Energy</ENAMEX>, which agreed to sell its stakes in 107 oil and natural gas fields to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Exploration</ENAMEX> for $114 million, advanced 1/2 to 38. The company said it expects to post a gain of about $22 million on the sale.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lomas Financial</ENAMEX>, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection for itself and two units, dropped 1 1/4 to 1 7/8 on 1.2 million shares. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips Industries</ENAMEX> surged 4 5/8 to 24 5/8 in active trading. The company accepted a takeover bid of $25.50 a share from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch Capital Partners</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall Industries</ENAMEX> added 1/2 to 18 3/4. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lodestar Group</ENAMEX> said it has an 8.8% stake in the company and had suggested previously that Marshall consider a leveraged recapitalization or restructuring.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> Index rose 0.02 to 381.40. Volume totaled 11,790,000 shares, compared with 10,490,000 Friday. There were 234 issues advancing, 324 issues declining and 255 unchanged.
Disappointing forecasts of third-quarter earnings hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riedel Environmental Technologies</ENAMEX>, which fell 2 5/8 to 16 3/4, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bush Industries</ENAMEX>, which dropped 1 3/4 to 10 1/4. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riedel</ENAMEX> said its earnings would be significantly lower than the year-earlier level; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said earnings would be little changed from a year earlier.
