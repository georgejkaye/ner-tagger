<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX> LIES LOW after the stock market's roller-coaster ride.
Lawmakers, haunted by charges that some of their comments contributed to the 1987 crash, generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation. But a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Energy and Commerce</ENAMEX> subcommittee will quiz <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> Wednesday, and Treasury Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> will go before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Banking</ENAMEX> panel Thursday.
The market's wild week may speed along the market-reform legislation that has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash. It may also expedite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s modest pending changes in junk-bond disclosure rules and intensify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>'s look at plans for giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short-term trades by pension funds.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> work well together on the plunge, despite the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> secretary opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>'s nomination to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> post.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAKER FALTERS</ENAMEX> in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics.
Despite seeing his plan for Israeli-Palestinian elections wither, the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling to cut U.S. economic or military aid to force Israeli cooperation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> nonetheless remains furious both at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shamir</ENAMEX>, for backing down on the elections, and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shamir</ENAMEX>'s rival, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX>, for political ineptitude in forcing a premature cabinet vote on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX>'s plan.
Meanwhile, some U.S. officials fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLO</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX> is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism. He is under intense fire from other Palestinian groups; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Syria</ENAMEX> is pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad Jibril</ENAMEX>, whose terrorist band is blamed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 bombing, as an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arafat</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DARMAN</ENAMEX>'S  MANEUVERS on the budget and capital gains hurt him in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicans</ENAMEX> as well as Democrats were angered by the budget director's rejection of Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX>'s effort to expedite a deficitcutting measure by stripping it of the capital-gains tax cut as well as pet Democratic projects. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Darman</ENAMEX> now blames the clash on miscommunication, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> GOP leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel</ENAMEX>, who carried the offer to him, observes, ``I was speaking English at the time, and quite loud so I could be understood.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> GOP leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> ridicules the budget chief on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> floor. Democratic counterpart <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX>, asked to interpret <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX>'s threat to make permanent the across-the-board Gramm-Rudman cuts that took effect this week, says, ``I don't even bother to interpret them.''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> suggests such tensions will dissipate quickly. ``If I can show signs of maturity, almost anybody can,'' he jokes.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HHS</ENAMEX> OFFICIALS expect Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> to continue a ban on research using fetal tissue.
Before he was confirmed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> said he had ``reservations about any blanket prohibitions on medical research.'' But now, an official says, he is ``surrounded by right-to-lifers,'' who contend that any breakthroughs in fetal-tissue research could increase the demand for abortions.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COOPERATION WANES</ENAMEX> on weapons development between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> pull out of a proposal to build new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> frigates; the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> have each withdrawn from missile projects. Defense experts say joint projects are increasingly squeezed by budget pressures and the desire to save domestic jobs; some also fear rising protectionism as European unity nears.
BOTH SIDES NOW: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> GOP lieutenant governor candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddy Dalton</ENAMEX> tries to have it both ways on the abortion issue. Though she opposes abortion in almost all cases, she airs a TV commercial using pro-choice buzzwords. ``A woman ought to have a choice in cases where her life or health are in danger and in cases of rape or incest,'' she proclaims.
HOT TOPIC: Interest in the abortion issue is so great that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hotline</ENAMEX>, a daily, computer-distributed political newsletter, comes up with a spinoff product called the Abortion Report dealing solely with its political implications.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CONSERVATIVES EXPECT Bush</ENAMEX> to solidify their majority on a key court.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has three vacancies to fill on the prestigious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.C. Circuit Court</ENAMEX>, which handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered a warm-up for future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> nominees. Conservatives now hold only a 5-4 edge. One slot is expected to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EEOC</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarence Thomas</ENAMEX>, a black conservative; after mulling a fight, liberals now probably won't put up a major struggle against him.
Other conservatives thought to be on the administration's short list include <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Uhlmann</ENAMEX>, who was passed over for the No. 2 job at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall Breger</ENAMEX>, chairman of a U.S. agency on administration.
The Bush administration would also like to nominate a woman; one possibility is former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> official <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Toensing</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MINOR MEMOS</ENAMEX>: In the wake of the failed Panama coup, a bumper sticker appears: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ollie</ENAMEX> Would Have Got Him.''... Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX>, on trial for bribery and extortion, puts statements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Record</ENAMEX> attributing missed votes to ``scheduling conflicts.''... A GOP Senate fund-raising letter from Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montana</ENAMEX> is made to appear personally written, and its opening line is, ``Please excuse my handwriting.'' But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burns</ENAMEX> confesses in an interview: ``That's not my handwriting.
