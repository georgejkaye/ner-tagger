In the past 30 years, the geologic equivalent of a millisecond, one of man's most devastating assaults upon nature has destroyed what was once the world's fourth largest lake, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Central Asia</ENAMEX>. In the course of a generation, its level has fallen 40 feet -- losing one-third of its area and 60% of its volume. Measured another way, the lost waters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX> (called a sea because of its size and fierce storms) would fill Lake <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Erie</ENAMEX>.
As recently as 1973, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX>, straddling the border between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Central Asian</ENAMEX> republics of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kazakhstan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Uzbekistan</ENAMEX>, supported commercial shipping and a thriving fishing industry that supplied 10% to 15% of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>'s freshwater catch. The major ports of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aral</ENAMEX>'sk <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral</ENAMEX>'sk in the northeast and Muynak in the south were linked by steamships that traveled the 220-mile-route between them.
By 1987 these once active ports were 25 to 30 miles from the receding water. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rusting</ENAMEX> freighters and fishing boats littered the newly formed sand dunes nearby. Fishermen cast their nets out for the last time in 1983. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salinity</ENAMEX>, which had more than doubled, killed off most of the sea's aquatic life. To preserve employment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Muynak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral</ENAMEX>'sk <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral</ENAMEX>'sk, the desert-bound canneries now process frozen fish shipped from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> oceans.
Each year 47 million tons of dust and salt from the exposed bottom are blown over and deposited in the cotton fields and deserts surrounding the sea. The salt, combined with enormous quantities of pesticides applied to the fields, makes a poisonous mixture. Everything from drinking water to mothers' milk is contaminated. A pipeline to bring drinkable water from afar is frantically under construction. Infant mortality in the region has climbed to the highest levels in the world.
One of the greatest ecological disasters of the 20th century, it turns out, was no accident. In the 1950s and 1960s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> decided to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> a leading producer of cotton by dramatically expanding the area in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Asia</ENAMEX> under irrigation and cultivation. Some outspoken scientists and engineers expressed serious reservations about the wisdom of this plan. But the leadership openly proclaimed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX>, an oasis in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>'s most arid region, was a dispensable resource that could be bartered at cost for crops, especially cotton and rice. ``Glasnost'' and rising environmental consciousness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> have revealed the terrible consequences of this miscalculation.
Soviet engineers and scientists were taught by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stalin</ENAMEX> to ``make no small plans.'' Three large deserts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kyzyl Kum</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara Kum</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barsuki</ENAMEX>, surround the Aral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea.</ENAMEX> To turn them into fertile and productive land, the engineers built the 800-mile-long <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara Kum Canal</ENAMEX>, the linchpin of a woefully ill-conceived water redistribution plan.
By the late 1970s, this giant irrigation ditch was fully operational and siphoning off enormous quantities of one of the sea's two source rivers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amudarya</ENAMEX>. This canal has poured so much water into the desert that the city of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashkhabad</ENAMEX> has resorted to flood-control barriers for protection. Withdrawals from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amudarya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syrdarya</ENAMEX> increased so much that not a drop of their water reached the sea in 1985-86.
In the finest traditions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet monumentalism</ENAMEX>, several years ago another ``nature-conquering'' proposal was approved to fix the damage from the first project. Dwarfing anything conceived by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee Valley</ENAMEX> Authority, plans were drawn up to divert portions of north-flowing Siberian rivers through a long and broad canal -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sibaral</ENAMEX>. The water was to be pumped down more than 600 miles from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ob</ENAMEX>-Irtysh system far to the northeast. A rough analogy would be pumping the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX> waters at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Orleans</ENAMEX> up to irrigate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX>. This canal was to provide relief to water-deficient parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Central Asia</ENAMEX> and replenish the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX>, the plight of which had become painfully obvious to the three million people living in its environs.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> canceled this project early in his tenure as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> general secretary, a decision hailed as a major victory for the fledgling Soviet environmental movement. However, the unfolding ecological disaster that prompted the diversion scheme would not abate. It now seems likely that the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX> that escapes desertification will be a mere cluster of lifeless, briny lakes by the year 2010.
To its credit, the Soviet government has belatedly taken several steps to repudiate its earlier positions, such as that of a deputy minister who asserted that ``the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral</ENAMEX> should die beautifully.'' First, it declared the region an ecological disaster area. Next, a resolution was passed last September mandating measures aimed at halting the region's environmental decline.
Since then, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral</ENAMEX> region has hosted at least two high-powered, high-profile groups of Soviet politicians, writers, scientists and lawyers. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ARAL</ENAMEX>-88 Expedition completed its 69-day mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Central Asia</ENAMEX> last October. The expedition, led by writer Grigoriy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reznichenko</ENAMEX>, submitted its report this May. Previewing its conclusions, in an interview following the expedition, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reznichenko</ENAMEX> stated that ``as a biological object the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX> has perished.'' Other conclusions: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life expectancy</ENAMEX> is plummeting in the region; infectious diseases, especially hepatitis, are nearing epidemic levels; and unemployment is on the rise with the loss of traditional local trades and professions. At the Congress of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peoples' Deputies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> in late spring, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX> disaster was one of the most frequently cited items on a long list of Soviet ecological calamities. It is clear that some help is on the way. However, given the persistent, expensive aftereffects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chernobyl</ENAMEX> nuclear plant explosion and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Armenian</ENAMEX> earthquake, the Soviets will be hard pressed to finance the rescue effort, estimated at 25 billion to 30 billion rubles. Perhaps it would be best to do what one impassioned speaker at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> suggested: Make the restoration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aral Sea</ENAMEX> a critical project of international disaster relief.
