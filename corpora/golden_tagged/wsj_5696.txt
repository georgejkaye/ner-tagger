Two of three European companies linked by the Italian news media to a scandal surrounding unauthorized lending by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch denied any wrongdoing, while a third declined to comment.
A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creusot Loire Industrie S.A.</ENAMEX> denied the French maker of armor plate has done business with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creusot Loire</ENAMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen AG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti International Signal PLC</ENAMEX> were named in the report as being under investigation by the Italian secret service. The secret service declined to comment on the report.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> spokesman said that earlier this year, the company had to deliver some spare parts -- worth less than $10 million -- for a petrochemical plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Basra</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>. The transaction was guaranteed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>, which obtained a counterguarantee from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> branch. The plant was built several years ago by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> Rheinstahl <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Technik</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> unit, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lummus Crest Inc.</ENAMEX>
``We have delivered the parts and we've got our money,'' said the spokesman. ``That's all'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thyssen</ENAMEX> had to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL Atlanta</ENAMEX>, he said, adding, ``It was completely normal business; nothing to do with weapons.''
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> provided commercial guarantees for a Ferranti weapons contract to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>. He added that his company uses ``many, many banks'' in financing its various international-defense contracts. He denied that any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BNL</ENAMEX> guarantees are involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ferranti</ENAMEX>'s current problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferranti</ENAMEX> has indefinitely suspended its stock-trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> pending an internal audit on ``significant irregularities'' in certain of its overseas defense contracts.
