Three of the nation's biggest airlines have reached a preliminary agreement to form a computer reservation system.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> unit said they tentatively plan to form a joint venture that would develop, own and market a global computer reservation system.
If the venture materializes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> would greatly increase the ability of travel agents to book its flights: its own Datas II system is only the fifth-largest in the industy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Travel</ENAMEX> agents use the reservation systems of the major airlines to book airline, car-rental, hotel and other reservations.
Earlier this year, the government blocked on antitrust grounds <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>'s plan to combine its Datas II system with the biggest system in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sabre</ENAMEX> reservation system of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX>, the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>.
Under the latest venture proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>, it would combine its system with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARS</ENAMEX> reservation system jointly operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delta</ENAMEX> would also pay $48 million to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>.
Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> would own 40%, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> would own one-third and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> 26% of the new company.
The agreement is subject to the signing of a definitive pact as well as certain other conditions, including approval of all three companies' directors.
