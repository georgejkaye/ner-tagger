<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interlake Corp.</ENAMEX> on Sept. 27 paid a previously announced $45-a-share special dividend to shareholders of record Aug. 21.
The company, which makes engineered materials and handling and packaging systems, declared the special $455 million pay-out in August, as part of a restructuring designed to thwart potential suitor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark IV Industries Inc.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark IV of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> disclosed in July that it was seeking regulators' permission to buy an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interlake</ENAMEX> stake of up to 14.9%.
Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interlake</ENAMEX>'s restructuring plan, which is generally thought to have deflected any possible Mark IV interest, the company also borrowed $550 million to pay for the dividend and to refinance previous debt holdings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interlake</ENAMEX> shares will begin trading on an ex-dividend basis today.
