<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> has agreed to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> demand to reduce a $400 million investment by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</ENAMEX> and remove KLM from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> board, according to one person familiar with the situation.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Checchi</ENAMEX>, who led a $3.65 billion buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">July</ENAMEX>, has agreed to cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> stake by $225 million, to $175 million, to ease government concerns about foreign airline influence over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>, the same person said.
Representatives of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> and Transportation Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Skinner</ENAMEX> still were haggling over other details within the framework of an agreement the two men apparently reached at a meeting last Friday.
Remaining hangups over the amount of time Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> will have to replace the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> funds, as well as certain reporting requirements, could delay an announcement of the agreement until later this week. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> is expected to make an unrelated public appearance today, however, and could conceivably make some disclosure then.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> talks took place against a backdrop of concern by both investors and participants in the pending $6.79 billion buy-out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL Corp.</ENAMEX> by a labor-management group financed in large part by another foreign airline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Airways PLC</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock rebounded by $2.50 a share to $276.50 yesterday following a total two-day decline of $12.25 Friday and Monday in reaction to reports of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi-Skinner</ENAMEX> talks. The price remains somewhat below the $300-a-share <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> buy-out, reflecting some doubt about whether it will close on schedule in late October at that price.
Many takeover stock traders were heartened by a statement in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> yesterday by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>'s chairman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord King</ENAMEX>, who said he is confident that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> will approve the buy-out. However, he and other participants in the buy-out were evidently in the dark about the particulars of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> talks.
The cutback in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KLM</ENAMEX> investment would reduce the Dutch airline's percentage of the $700 million in cash equity raised for the buy-out from 57% to 25%, the legal limit for a foreign investment in a U.S. carrier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> has only a 5% voting stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> because its stake is mostly in non-voting preferred.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> is putting up $750 million, 78% of the $965 million in cash equity raised for the United buy-out. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> will have a much smaller voting stake of 15% because most of its investment is in non-voting preferred stock.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> already is planning to sell $300 million of that preferred within two years, and could accelerate that sale to meet government concerns. That preferred's dividend yield of 18% could be reset up to 21% to aid the sale. The issue also includes a warrant for a 2% stake in the airline, which would cut <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> employees' share from 75% to 73%.
One person familiar with the buy-out said, however, that if the buying group has to offer extra equity to attract investors to substitute for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX>, ``it could get messy with the pilots.'' The pilots and management, longtime enemies, have forged a fragile alliance that could unravel in a difficult renegotiation.
Some takeover stock traders noted yesterday that the price level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> stock, a 7.8% discount to the $300-a-share buy-out price, seems to be assuming either a price cut or a delay in the acquisition. However, stock of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NWA Inc.</ENAMEX> traded at a discount nearly that large a few weeks before Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Checchi</ENAMEX> completed his buy-out, amid similar fears the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> might intervene before the closing. Instead, the agency's intervention came afterwards.
Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> is considering the national security implications of foreign airline influence over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers, he also is concerned about the mere presence of foreign airline executives on U.S. airline boards. Currently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KLM</ENAMEX> has one of 12 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> board seats, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Air</ENAMEX> would get one of 15 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> seats.
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skinner</ENAMEX> noted in a speech last week, foreign airline directors on the board of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines could jeopardize the confidentiality of the U.S. position in bilateral negotiations over international routes and landing rights.
