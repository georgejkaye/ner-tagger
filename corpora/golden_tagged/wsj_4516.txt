<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> said it won't invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories Inc.</ENAMEX>, the consortium set up last June in a bid to retake part of the semiconductor market from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
The move deals a setback to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX>, which is seeking major investors to back its efforts to enter the $10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Drams</ENAMEX>), which store data in everything from cars to computers.
Separately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cypress Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX>'s chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.J. Rodgers</ENAMEX>, launched a new assault against U.S. Memories by urging <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> to transfer its chip-making technologies to Cypress instead of to U.S. Memories.
An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said that ``after looking over our many options,'' that it became clear that ``the U.S. Memories option doesn't fit into our priorities at this time. There's no direct benefit to our customers.'' She said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Louis Gassee</ENAMEX>, president of the Apple products division, made the decision.
U.S. Memories President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sanford Kane</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> hasn't given him its final word yet. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSI Logic Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilfred Corrigan</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Memories</ENAMEX>, plans to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> officials next week to try to persuade them to invest.
Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> officials contend Apple's decision isn't a major blow. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said he expects to announce three or more new investors within three weeks. That, he said, would provide a catalyst for other companies to join. ``It will be a month before all this comes together, then it will take off,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corrigan</ENAMEX> said.
The Apple decision ``is not a major setback from the standpoint of the numbers'' of companies or dollars, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said, but ``it could be a political setback.'' It would be a political setback because Apple, with a large share of the personal computer market and a prominent corporate image, was seen by observers as a key potential ally to U.S. Memories.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> said it isn't likely to change its mind. Unlike many chip makers, the company doesn't need memory chips to fill out its product line, the spokeswoman said. Apple has a policy of buying its chips from a wide range of suppliers around the world and feels its resources are better directed toward research and development spending, she said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> became president and chief executive of U.S. Memories last June, when the consortium was set up by a group of big electronics concerns: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard Co.</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSI Logic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX>
Each investing company will purchase a 1% to 10% share, or make a $5 million to $50 million investment, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX>, which will be run as a for-profit venture. Members will commit to buying a total of 50% of chip production. The $1 billion venture, which will make chips based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> technology, seeks to grab a 5% to 10% share of the world Drams market.
In 1977, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> had a commanding 70% share of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Drams</ENAMEX> market, but it lost out to a fierce market share push by Japanese conglomerates in the mid-1980s. The Japanese now command about 90% of the market for the lastest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Drams</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> has crisscrossed the country with his gospel, imploring chip makers and chip users such as Apple to join up and help restore the U.S. strength in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Drams</ENAMEX>. Computer makers, he has said, were hurt by U.S. weakness in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drams</ENAMEX> last year, when chips were in short supply and Japanese vendors didn't provide enough chips for U.S. companies. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said he has met with top officials of 17 companies and plans to meet with 28 more companies.
The meetings, he said, have been ``highly enthusiastic. I have no reason to be anything but optimistic.''
Companies other than Apple haven't said whether they will join. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the company is still evaluating the venture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST Research</ENAMEX>'s president and chief executive, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safi Qureshey</ENAMEX>, said he met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> last week but hadn't decided yet whether to invest in the venture. Still, companies like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX> have welcomed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Memories as a new supplier. ``If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Memories</ENAMEX> has quality, availability and price -- if those things are met -- we'd love to do business with them,'' he said.
U.S. Memories will finish a detailed business plan later this month, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said, and the consortium will select a factory site shortly thereafter. Fifteen states have submitted siting proposals, he said.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> is scheduled to testify today before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Judiciary Committee</ENAMEX>'s subcommittee on economic and commercial law. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said he plans to say that consortiums such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Memories need changes in laws to keep them from being accused of antitrust violations. Although Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kane</ENAMEX> said he won't ask for federal funding, he said he plans to call for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to take action to ``remove obstacles that prevent the precompetitive cooperation needed'' among U.S. companies to meet the challenge from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cypress</ENAMEX>, a virulent critic of consortiums, earlier testified that U.S. Memories posed a threat to competition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cypress</ENAMEX> spokesman said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX> sent a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> yesterday in which he proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> transfer its four megabit and 16 megabit chip technologies to Cypress instead of to U.S. Memories. In exchange, Cypress would provide royalties and a guarantee of supply.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX> said in an interview that Cypress can make the same chips ``faster, better and cheaper by a factor of 50 without having to jerk around the antitrust laws in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
