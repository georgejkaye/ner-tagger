The recent bids for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> have led Congress to move with supersonic speed to protect incumbent airline managements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block, for up to 50 days, any bid for 15% or more of a U.S. airline, even a straight cash purchase. Transportation Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Skinner</ENAMEX>, who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers, now says the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Bartlett</ENAMEX>, who has 40,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> workers in his district, says the bill is ``good politics, but bad law.'' It is ironic that at a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s partial airline deregulation is being emulated by governments from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Zealand</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>, so many in Congress favor an incumbent-protection program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX>.
