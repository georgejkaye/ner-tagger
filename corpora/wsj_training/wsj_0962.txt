<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck & Co.</ENAMEX> signed a contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Vila</ENAMEX>, the former host of the popular public television program ``This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old House</ENAMEX>,'' to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer.
The do-it-yourself show, slated to start airing by June 1990, marks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>'s entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products. In recent months, sales of home improvement items have sagged, along with sales of other big ticket durable goods.
The show also signals Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX>'s return as a television celebrity. Earlier this year, public television station WGBH in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> fired Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX> after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements.
With Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX> as host, ``This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old House</ENAMEX>'' became one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Public Broadcasting Service</ENAMEX>'s top 10 programs, airing weekly on about 300 of the network's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Depot Inc.</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based home center chain, objected when Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX> started doing commercial endorsements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rickel Home Centers</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> building supply company that competes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Depot</ENAMEX> in some markets.
``I'm ecstatic about the change,'' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX>, whose new syndicated program is called ``Home Again with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Vila</ENAMEX>.'' In an interview, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX> criticized his old show, which is continuing with a new host.
``Public TV is in fantasy land,'' he said. ``Last season, we did a story that involved spending $700,000 in converting a two-family house into a bed and breakfast.'' In the new show, he said, ``we're going to spend $60,000 building a start-up house'' for a young couple.
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> wouldn't comment on the brouhaha over Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX>'s commercial endorsements, it appears to be building a fence around Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX>'s affections. His contract makes him ``exclusive'' spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>'s home improvement marketing campaigns. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ogilvy & Mather</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group PLC</ENAMEX>, will handle the advertising account and syndication.
The only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time-Life</ENAMEX> home improvement and repair books. His other agreements to promote products have expired. Little matter for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vila</ENAMEX>, who complains that ``public TV never paid me more than $40,000 a year.'' He said his compensation under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> contract is ``a multimillion dollar deal.
