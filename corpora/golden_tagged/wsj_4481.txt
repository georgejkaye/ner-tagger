In the poor African nation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malawi</ENAMEX>, a fish farm produces a meager harvest -- the project's financier, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> agency, put the hatchery next to a bird sanctuary.
-- In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Somalia</ENAMEX>, thousands of children in refugee camps become more susceptible to deadly epidemics than if they had not been ``helped'' at all -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> charity canceled its innoculation campaign after the first round of booster shots and a budget snafu.
-- In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mozambique</ENAMEX>, farmers who scratched out a living despite the 1988 drought are put out of business -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community</ENAMEX> food aid flooded local markets in provinces where it was not needed.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Hancock</ENAMEX>'s ``Lords of Poverty: The Power, Prestige and Corruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Aid Business'' (Atlantic Monthly Press</ENAMEX>, 226 pages, $17.95) provides a stinging retort to the perennial claim of the development set that such glitches are an inevitable part of doing God's work in the Third World. Beyond the boondoggles, the book also is about the self-serving paternalism with which the international aid establishment regards the world's less developed peoples.
Former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Africa</ENAMEX> correspondent for The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economist</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> tells of food-aid debacles, infighting among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> agencies, bilateral aid programs driven by export-promotion aims, private charities that send as little as 10% of raised funds to the Third World, and ``structural adjustments'' promoted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> that only grind the poor further down into dusty subsistence.
Beginning with its sarcastic dedication to the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> staffers ``who illegally acquired and read my original synopsis in the early days of this project,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX>'s book is, even if minimally structured, an engrossing litany from the seamy underside of the aid business.
At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> a host of agencies receive criticism, but special attention is given to the mini-empire of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edouard Saouma</ENAMEX>, the director general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Agriculture Organization</ENAMEX>, who operates what amounts to a $40 million annual slush fund for capital goods that he personally doles out to friendly countries, the author writes. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saouma</ENAMEX>, who likes to be addressed as Your Excellency, once held up Ethiopian food aid for 20 days during the 1984 famine because he disliked an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> delegate. At least the members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Development Inc.</ENAMEX>, as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> calls the aid establishment, are pretty adept at feeding themselves. The 10,000 delegates attending some 700 social events during the annual 1986 meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> rang up a tab of $10 million, he writes.
Dining in style clearly is part of the aid package. A few days ago, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMF</ENAMEX> officials supposedly advanced the cause of the world's downtrodden at this year's meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, 400 spouses reached for artichoke bottoms stuffed with crabmeat, cherry tomatoes filled with salmon mousse, gazpacho, grilled salmon and chocolate pate.
In his pages on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> takes particular aim at its newest fad: loans for market-oriented reforms. These structural-adjustment loans send corrupt presidents and ministers of finance laughing all the way to the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World) bank</ENAMEX>. No sacrifices, he writes, are demanded of them personally, while the poor are asked to tighten their belts. Why, asks Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX>, is it essential for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zaire</ENAMEX> to dismiss 7,000 teachers for ``budgetary reasons'' when President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mobutu Seso Seko</ENAMEX> owns 51 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mercedes Benzes</ENAMEX> and 11 chateaux in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>?
And yet, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX>'s observations don't go nearly far enough. He is right that Third World regimes have been laying off nearly all adjustments on the poor. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> stops there, implicitly suggesting that the Third World's ailing statist economies could continue to provide current levels of social programs and subsidies were it not for structural-adjustment loans.
He fails to acknowledge that Third World governments have improvidently exceeded their means in financing social programs and consumer subsidies for (mostly urban) poor, as well as sinecures for elites. To see any improvement in the economies of the Third World, much more needs to be done than simply withdrawing say, food subsidies. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> writes little of such needed adjustments as freeing prices paid to farmers or privatizing hemorrhaging state-owned companies.
Instead he insists that ``the forces at work are largely external in nature and poor countries have little or no control over them.'' That's nonsense. Even Third World thinkers now are admitting that post-colonialism brought new brands of exploitation at the hands of venal leaders.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX> unnecessarily diminishes his compelling expose by insisting on extolling the social and economic success story of ``un-aided'' post-1979 Nicaragua. Conveniently forgotten are the hefty subsidies from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and a gaping deficit financed almost entirely by printing money, causing a 1988 inflation rate of around 14,000%. The consensus is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicaragua</ENAMEX> is a mess.
But aside from these few analytical omissions and wanderings, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hancock</ENAMEX>'s major conclusions square soundly with his evidence: ``Aid has created a moral tone in international affairs that denies the hard task of wealth creation and that substitutes easy handouts for the rigors of self-help. Throughout the Third World it has allowed the dead grip of imposed officialdom to suppress popular choice and individual freedom.''
