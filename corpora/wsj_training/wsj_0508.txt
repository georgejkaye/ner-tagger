<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lehman</ENAMEX>'s editorial-page article on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population (``In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Undead Walk</ENAMEX>,'' Oct. 18). The media's treatment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX> War, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> administration's denigration of the military, and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there. The resulting haunted house tends to reward followership, not leadership, it creates guilt about wearing the uniform, and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts' role, i.e., to be able to win if called on.
Perhaps the Halloween season is a good time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment.

Where does Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> get off castigating Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Marshall</ENAMEX> for muscling in on naval prerogatives? Ever since the days of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Thayer Mahan</ENAMEX> (U.S. naval officer and naval historian) and Teddy Roosevelt the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has been the service most favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> officialdom. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> overlooks the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> possesses its own air force (the carrier fleet) and its own army (the Marines), which in turn has its own air force.
Of course these turf battles are unseemly, wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer.

I agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mr. Lehman</ENAMEX> 100%
Isn't this the same guy who resigned as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> secretary because he couldn't get his 1,000-ship Navy?
I personally do not want to hasten Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX>'s demise, but I can see him figuring prominently in his own article.
